\subsection{Conclusion}
In this report we used two main approaches to handle the problem of automatic text summarization: Wordwise by feeding word embeddings in a classifier,  and a sequence classification approach by classifying all possible sentences as nuggets or not, where sentence embeddings as well as word embeddings were used as features. The former performed better than the later.

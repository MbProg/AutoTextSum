BeauchampSharp Tragedy

Jereboam Orville Beauchamp (September 24, 1802 - hanged July 7, 1826) was an American lawyer and convicted murderer, who was one of the central figures in The Beauchamp-Sharp Tragedy.
Jereboam vowed he would avenge her, so in the Fall of 1821 he went to Frankfort, Kentucky to seek out Sharp and murder him.
During the legislative election of 1824, John V. Waring had conducted a smear campaign against Sharp by printing handbills accusing him of seducing Ann Cook of Bowling Green, Kentucky and fathering an illegitimate child born to her in 1820.
Jereboam, infuriated by these accusations about his wife and Sharp, vowed revenge, and in the early hours of November 7, 1825 he knocked on Col. Sharps' door in Frankfort and fatally stabbed him after asking him if he was indeed Col. Sharp.
The Kentucky Tragedy: A Story of Conflict and Change in Antebellum America
A murder case with all the elements of melodrama -- including seduction and betrayal, political intrigue, honor, and greed -- the Kentucky Tragedy of 1825 riveted the attention of the nation.
He uncovers an intricate connection between public fascination with the Kentucky Tragedy and changing ideas about gender roles, social identity, human motivation, and freedom in the years leading up to the Civil War.
Around 1819, Colonel Solomon P. Sharp, one of Kentucky's leading politicians, allegedly seduced Ann Cooke, who subsequently delivered a stillborn child she claimed was fathered by Sharp.
Bruce reveals that the Kentucky Tragedy elicited more literary works than did any other episode of the period.
Jereboam O. Beauchamp
Jereboam Orville Beauchamp was an American lawyer who murdered the Kentucky legislator Solomon P. Sharp, an event known as the Beauchampâ€“Sharp Tragedy.
In 1821, Sharp was accused of fathering the illegitimate stillborn child of a woman named Anna Cooke.
Sharp denied paternity of the child, and public opinion favored him.
During Sharp's 1825 campaign for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives, Cooke's alleged illegitimate child was raised as an issue.
The Kentucky Tragedy
On November 7, 1825, in Frankfort, Kentucky, an attorney named Jereboam O. Beauchamp fatally stabbed politician Solomon P. Sharp.
Beauchamp had been an admirer of Sharp until he heard that the focus of his admiration had allegedly fathered an illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, though Sharp denied paternity of the stillborn child.
The story became a scandalous national headline, earning the nickname "The Kentucky Tragedy."
Jereboam O. Beauchamp
In the early hours of November 7, 1825, he fatally stabbed Colonel Solomon Sharp, a former attorney-general of Kentucky at Sharp's home in Frankfort, Kentucky.
During an 1824 political campaign a handbill had been circulated accusing Sharp of seducing Ann Cook and fathering an illegitimate child by her in 1820.
Solomon Porcius Sharp (August 22, 1787 â€“ November 7, 1825) was an American attorney and politician, serving as attorney general of Kentucky and a member of the United States Congress and the Kentucky General Assembly.
His murder by Jereboam O. Beauchamp in 1825 is referred to as the Beauchampâ€“Sharp Tragedy or "The Kentucky Tragedy."
In 1820, rumors surfaced that Sharp had fathered a stillborn illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter.
Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825.

Jereboam O. Beauchamp murders Solomon P. Sharp
Jereboam Orville Beauchamp (September 6, 1802 - July 7, 1826) was an American lawyer, convicted murderer, and one of the central figures in the Beauchamp-Sharp Tragedy.
After observing the lawyers practicing in Glasgow and Bowling Green, he determined to pursue a career in the legal profession.
Jereboam vowed he would avenge her, so in the Fall of 1821 he went to Frankfort, Kentucky to seek out Sharp and murder him.
During the legislative election of 1824, John V. Waring had conducted a smear campaign against Sharp by printing out handbills accusing him of seducing Ann Cook of Bowling Green, Kentucky and fathering an illegitimate child born to her in 1820.
Jereboam, infuriated by these accusations about his wife and Sharp, vowed revenge, and in the early hours of November 7, 1825 he knocked on Colonel Solomon P. Sharps' door in Frankfort and fatally stabbed him after asking him if he was indeed Colonel Sharp.
Jereboam was hustled off to the gallows, but was so weak from his wounds he had to be supported by two men before being hanged in Frankfort, Kentucky.

Frankfort, Kentucky
During the campaign, Old Court supporters again raised the issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment of Anna Cooke.
Old Court supporter John Upshaw Waring printed handbills that not only accused Sharp of fathering Cooke's child, but further claiming that Sharp had denied paternity of the child on the grounds that it was a mulatto and the son of a Cooke family slave.
Beauchamp approached the house at approximately two o'clock in the morning on November 7, 1825.

Early on the morning of 7 November 1825, Jereboam O. Beauchamp stabbed to death Colonel Solomon E Sharp in the entryway of Sharp's Frankfort, Kentucky, home.
Beauchamp killed Sharp because he had allegedly seduced and impregnated Ann Cooke about six years earlier and thereafter denied the affair, describing Cooke's stillborn child as a mulatto.
The Kentucky Tragedy
Jereboam Beauchamp stabbed Col. Solomon Sharp to avenge the honor of his wife, Anna Cooke Beauchamp.
The story of the murderâ€”known from the start as the Kentucky Tragedyâ€”was viewed by the Beauchamps as one of love, treachery, vengeance, and tragic heroism; all the elements of the romantic novels they both so dearly loved.

Miss Anna Cooke (artist's conception, 1851)
The central figure in the Kentucky Tragedy, Anna Cooke Beauchamp, is also its most mysterious.
Most of what is known about her comes from two often conflicting documents, The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp, and Vindication of the Character of the Late Col Soloman P. Sharp, written by his brother, Dr. Leander Sharp.
Both documents agree (though making different points) that Anna Cooke Beauchamp was well-read, unconventional, and disdainful of society and its rules.
Even if she was not a beauty, as her later detractors would say, she was vivacious and popular as a young woman, but, in her most obvious defiance of social norms, Anna Cooke remained unmarried by choice.
Her failure to marry prompted rumors of sexual misbehaviorâ€” rumors that proved true in 1820 when thirty-five year old Anna Cooke became pregnant.
The Sharp family lived near the Cookes and Anna Cooke had known the Solomon Sharp for at least twelve years.
Solomon Sharp also had bitter enemies in the arena of Kentucky politics and in 1821, they used Anna Cookeâ€™s accusations to try to derail his bid for State Attorney General, producing a broadside that charged Sharp with seducing Anna Cooke.
It can never be known for certain whether Solomon Sharp had sexual relations with Anna Cooke, but he gave the appearance of a man who was happily married and whose wife Eliza was expecting their first child in 1819.
Contrary to what would be later asserted in Beauchampâ€™s Confession, Anna Cooke was not an orphan at the time of her pregnancy, at least two of her brothers were still alive.
Like Anna Cooke, Beauchamp was strong-willed and eccentric, viewing himself as above the petty dictates of society.
Though she was seventeen years older than he, Beauchamp fell madly in love with Anna Cooke.
In 1824 Anna Cooke agreed to marry Jereboam Beauchamp though Sharp was still alive, but according to Bauchampâ€™s Confession, they continued to plot his murder.
In 1825, after his tenure as Attorney General, Sharp campaigned for General Assembly and his opponents revived the charge that he seduced Anna Cooke.
The first suspects included some of the more vehement of Sharpâ€™s political opponents, but when it was learned that Jereboam Beauchamp, the husband of Anna Cooke, had been in Frankfort that day, he became the sole suspect.
Together in the cell, the Beauchamps wrote The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp, a document which they believed would save Jereboam from the gallows.
The Confessions of Jereboam Beauchamp was published after the execution and laid the foundation or the myth of the Kentucky Tragedy.

Find A Grave: Jereboam O. Beauchamp
â€” Jereboam O. Beauchamp, convicted of murder, hanging, Kentucky.
Beauchamp murdered Kentucky legislator Solomon P. Sharp after the state representative denied paternity of a child by Anna Cooke, whom Beauchamp wed after the birth of the child.
On November 7, 1825, Frankfort, Kentucky, was startled by the murder of Colonel Solomon P. Sharp, former Congressman, Attorney-General of the State, and at the time of his death a member-elect of the Kentucky House of Representatives, by Jereboam O. Beauchamp, a young lawyer.
This series of incidents, which was almost immediately labelled the â€œKentucky Tragedy,â€ attracted Poe, together with many of his contemporaries.
Accounts of the murder, trial, and execution appeared in the newspapers of 1825 and 1826, especially the seven newspapers of Frankfort, Kentucky.
Mabbott suggests that from Hoffmanâ€™s words Poe probably took the idea of â€œdrama set in another age â€œ and that a brief notice of Hoffmanâ€™s book in the Southern Literary Messenger (April 1835) is probably Poeâ€™s.4 Despite the fact that the case had been the subject of several literary works since 1826, the only other sources Poe seems to have used are two pamphlets: The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp . . . . (Bloomfield, Ky., 1826); and â€œLetters of Ann Cook, late Mrs. Beauchamp, to her friend in Maryland containing a short history of the life of that remarkable woman, published by one W. Râ€”â€”n, of Charles County, Marylandâ€ (Washington, D.C., 1826) (5).
The Kentucky Tragedy
Heâ€™d come to admire a particularly astute lawyer named Col. Solomon Sharp, whoâ€™d been twice elected to the state legislature and to the U.S. House of Representatives.
In 1820, Beauchampâ€™s fondness of Sharp ended when it was alleged that Col. Sharp had fathered the illegitimate child of Anne Cooke, who lived not far from Beauchamp in Bowling Green.
Sharp denied he had fathered the stillborn child, calling Cooke â€œa base woman.â€ Beauchamp, 18, soon sought an audience with Cooke, 36, who turned him away.
Enter Beauchamp, described as a â€œwild, eccentric lawyer,â€ who, over time, managed to gain Cookeâ€™s confidence.
Eventually, he proposed and she agreed on one condition: that he avenge her honor by killing Sharp.
But during the campaign, a handbill surfaced raising the issue of Sharpâ€™s alleged seduction of Anne Cookeâ€™s child with the added claim Sharp had denied paternity to the illegitimate stillborn on the grounds the child was mullato, having likely been fathered by a family slave.
The Kentucky Tragedy: A Story of Conflict and Change in Antebellum America.
The Kentucky Tragedy is a thoroughly enjoyable, interesting, and illuminating book.
The tragedy of the title describes a series of events, with the 1825 murder of Solomon Sharp in Frankfort, Kentucky at the center.
These events were set in motion in or around 1819, when, after engaging in extra-marital sex with Ann Cooke, Sharp denied paternity of a stillborn child subsequently born to her.
Beauchamp murdered Sharp that summer, and was arrested, tried, and condemned to death.
Dickson D. Bruce Jr. situates The Kentucky Tragedy among existing historiographies of antebellum crime and print culture.
The first two chapters of The Kentucky Tragedy lay out the details of the case, tracing its developments and the struggles among its actors to control the narrative.
Here Bruce shows how a close look at narratives of the Kentucky Tragedy reveals links between literature, political changes, and "deeper concerns about the political and social order" (p. 124).
It is in this chapter that Bruce makes a particularly important contribution to the existing historiography by cogently arguing for the Kentucky Tragedy narratives as evidence of concerns over citizens' vulnerability to "political seduction" (p. 134).
The Kentucky Tragedy offers readers a very fine example of how to productively and intelligently mine literary texts for their deeper meanings and significance in the ongoing processes of human history.

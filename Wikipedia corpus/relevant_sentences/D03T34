Ordinances of 1311

England's Worst King in the Medieval Period
The last few weeks, reading studies on late medieval English monarchs roughly in the period after the Norman Conquest up until the fifteenth century, have left me grappling with the fascinating and highly debated issue: who was England's worst medieval king?
Of course, not all English kings will be considered here, since the likes of Henry II, Edward III and Henry V are widely recognised to have been comparatively successful monarchs in medieval England.
William Rufus, also known as William II of England, reigned for thirteen years in the period 1087-1100, following the death of his highly successful father William the Conqueror.
The third son of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders, William Rufus can arguably be considered one of, if not England's worst, medieval king, because of his unfavourable temperament, his dubious policies and his notorious reign.
William never married, and as the third son of King William could never realistically have hoped to attain the throne of England.
At the age of about 27, William sailed to England from Tonques and was crowned in September 1087.
Frank Barlow describes him on the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as being at the time of his accession 'a seasoned soldier and commander but with only a limited knowledge of England, and, although well acquainted with his father's ways, without experience of government'.
William's reign was unstable the moment he commenced it, most notably in 1088 with the rebellion of the nobles who supported his elder brother Robert, the ruler of Normandy, in favour of uniting England and Normandy.
Notwithstanding this, the historian H.W.C. Davis of Oxford University, in his book England Under the Normans and Angevins 1066-1272, first published in 1905, is dismissive of Rufus, characterising him as 'so illiterate that he could not spell his way through an ordinary letter', he 'fought and squandered, leaving extortion to his clerks and judges'; he 'mounted the throne with little preparation and less fitness for that high position', criticising his policies towards the Church and his foreign policy during his reign.
Yet Barlow dismisses the notion that he could be seen as England's worst medieval king, writing: 'he had maintained good order and satisfactory justice in England and restored good peace to Normandy.
Davis seems to rate King Stephen the worst medieval king in England's history, closing his account of Stephen's reign with the passage: 'Stephen did not die too soon... Too simple to anticipate intrigues, too scrupulous to destroy the root from which they sprang, too vacillating to crush them when they began to take effect, he failed alike in peace and war.
Among all our medieval sovereigns none owed his title in so real a sense to the election of the nation; few showed themselves more incapable; none was a greater curse to the nation... his reign furnished a warning...' Are these claims fair, suggesting as they do that Stephen was England's worst medieval king?
Henry I seems to have regarded Stephen, who was his nephew, as his successor at this time, but following the death of Henry's daughter Matilda's husband in 1125, the situation changed, and in 1127, having returned to England, Matilda was declared heir to the English throne.
Stephen immediately came to England, and was received by the citizens as king, probably because of his comparative popularity in English society at this time.
Matilda's husband Geoffrey also periodically invaded in this period, and many saw Matilda as the rightful ruler of England.
The situation took a turn for the worse in 1139, when civil war in England occurred.
Empress Matilda was invited by Henry I's consort Adeliza to stay with her at Arundel, and in September the former Empress and her half-brother Robert invaded England.
The king, later captured by Robert, was imprisoned in Bristol Castle, and Matilda was proclaimed Lady of the English - in effect, England's first ruling female.
By 1147 England had suffered severely from the 'Anarchy', and it was believed to be in a state of chaos and destruction.
Yet was he England's worst king?
Most famous for the Magna Carta (1215), John has a strong claim to being England's worst king.
John was born in 1199 as the ninth child, and sixth son, of Henry II of England and his infamous queen consort Eleanor of Aquitaine.
In England, John's financial measures were not popular.
A potential French invasion undermined England's security, worsened by increasing baronial unrest.
Stephen Langton was later made Archbishop, and John was furious, barring Langton from entering England and seizing the archbishopric's lands and papal possessions.
Innocent, not surprisingly, placed an interdict on England in 1208.
Following John's return from France in 1214, rebel barons in north and east England organised resistance to his rule, congregating at Northampton in May 1215 and renouncing their feudal ties to John, appointing Robert FitzWalter as their military leader in an entirely unprecedented action.
In November John retook it, and while John was initially successful, by the end of the summer the rebels had regained southeast England and parts of the north.
Kate Norgate, a Victorian historian, attacked 'his almost superhuman wickedness', although Whiggish scholars saw Magna Carta as essential in the economic and political progress of England during this period.
Thus, while it is not certain that John was England's worst medieval king, his reign was certainly characterised by conflict and controversy, and it cannot be seen as a success in any sense of the word.
Many probably see Edward II as England's worst ever king.
Edward was the fourth son and eleventh child of Edward I of England and his queen Eleanor of Castile.
Following the death of his father in 1307, Edward acceded to the throne as king of England aged twenty-three, comparatively young for an English monarch.
Renowned for her beauty, intelligence, and diplomatic and political competence, Isabella arrived in England at a time of increasing discontent between the king and the barons (similarly to John in a sense).
These problems were compounded when Edward left Piers to serve as Regent of England in 1308 when he travelled to marry Isabella, and some barons in the Ordinances of 1311 insisted vocally that Piers be banished immediately from the kingdom, due to the troubles associated with his presence.
Other concerns present in the Ordinances concerned fiscal reform, setbacks in the Anglo-Scottish war, and the king's personal incompetence.
In 1325, Queen Isabella returned to France following a disagreement between England and France over whether Edward should pay homage to the French king.
Isabella declared that she would not return to England unless the Despensers were removed.
Edward was betrayed by those formerly close to him, perhaps alienated by his policies, and in September 1326 his wife and her lover invaded England.
When all is said and done, there is a strong case for the claim that Edward II is England's worst medieval monarch.
Whether Edward really was 'weak and vicious', he can be criticised for his ineffectual policies, which led to the alienation of courtiers and undermined England's security devastatingly.
Was Richard II England's worst king?
The king turned his attention to Scotland, leading an expedition in 1385, but nothing came of it, while a French invasion of England undoubtedly undermined any notion of England's stability in these years.
Richard gained increasing authority at court, and promised to restore stability which had not been present in England during his reign.
Henry was disinherited and banished from England following a dispute with the earl of Norfolk, who was also banished.
Yet when Richard left in May 1399 for Ireland, Henry famously invaded England and later took the throne, deposing Richard.
It does not seem that Richard, in comparison with Edward II, can be classified England's worst medieval king, but he had certainly lost the majority of his subjects' respect and devotion by the time of his deposition in 1399, meaning his rule, on the whole, cannot be judged a success.
Helen E. Maurer, in her sympathetic study of Henry VI's notorious queen, Margaret of Anjou (see http://www.conorbyrnex.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/margaret-of-anjou-she-wolf.html), dismissively wrote of Henry VI that he was perhaps 'the greatest disaster' England was ever to experience.
Indeed, many would agree with her that Henry VI was, quite simply, a disaster; England's worst medieval king.
The son of  the renowned and glorious king Henry V and his consort Catherine of Valois, Henry became king of England nine months old, and we have seen that minority rule never works well.
Warwick returned to England, forcing King Edward into exile, and restored Henry in 1470.
Although Henry may not have been unlikeable personally, he has a fair claim to being England's worst medieval monarch for what his reign brought about.
I don't wish to be attacked by the Richard III Society here, but it would be nonsensical to write an article on England's worst medieval king without at least mentioning Richard III, for he was demonised in his lifetime up until the present day, and many would argue that he was, by far, England's worst medieval king.
Following that king's premature death in 1471, it is believed that, fearing hostile and cruel behaviour from his sister-in-law Queen Elizabeth Woodville and her family at court, who were believed to be hoping to exclude Richard utterly from power, Richard seized control of the new king, the 12-year old Edward V, and later his brother Richard of York, in an attempt to control the political situation in England at the time.
Whether or not Richard was really as evil as Shakespeare made him out to be is unlikely, yet he certainly took advantage of the uncertain political and dynastic situation in England at the time.
But it cannot be doubted that many would argue that he has a strong claim to being England's worst ever medieval monarch.
It's difficult to say who England's worst medieval monarch was, for their situations were so different, the context altered dramatically, and the king's own personality played a fundamental role.
Other kings not mentioned here might be recognised by other historians to deserve the title worst king of England in the medieval period - perhaps, for some Henry I, for instance.
These three have strong claims to being England's worst medieval monarch.
However, the conflict that would have far reaching consequences for the constitutional history of England was of a domestic nature.
Edward II though took a novel approach, and argued against the 1311 ordinances on the basis of the relationship of the Sovereign to the law.
"_Sire, will you grant and keep and by your oath confirm to the people of England the laws and customs given to them by the previous just and god-fearing kings, your ancestors_, and especially the laws, customs, and liberties granted to the clergy and people by the glorious king, the sainted Edward, your predecessor?"
Whereas our lord King Edward, son of King Edward, on March 16, in the third year of his reign, granted to the prelates, earls, and barons of his realm ... ;[1] and whereas the archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all England, and the bishops, earls, and barons chosen for the purpose, drew up certain ordinances that begin as follows ... , which ordinances our said lord the king caused to be rehearsed and examined in his parliament at York three weeks after Easter in the fifteenth year of his reign ...; and whereas, through that examination in the said parliament, it was found that by the ordinances thus decreed the royal power of our said lord the king was wrongfully limited in many respects, to the injury of his royal lordship and contrary to the estate of the crown; and whereas, furthermore, through such ordinances and provisions made by subjects in times past against the royal authority of our lord the king's ancestors, the kingdom has incurred troubles and wars, whereby the land has been imperilled: [therefore] it is agreed and established at the said parliament by our lord the king, by the said prelates, earls, and barons, and by the whole community of the realm assembled in this parliament, that everything ordained by the said Ordainers and contained in the said ordinances shall henceforth and forever cease [to be valid], losing for the future all title, force, virtue, and effect; and that the statutes and establishments duly made by our lord the king and his ancestors prior to the said ordinances shall remain in force.
The other, perhaps more important reason was to ensure that the Barons cannot undo the work done by the Statute of York merely by force or another set of ordinances.
This is what explains the provision in the statute that all ordinances made by the â€œsubjectsâ€ against the â€œestate of the crownâ€ to be void; and the further, more significant provision that â€œbut that matters which are to be determined with regard to the estate of our lord the king and of his heirs, or with regard to the estate of the kingdom and of the people, shall be considered, granted, and established in parliamentâ€.
Instead it was seen as a safeguard against future renegade Barons who could draft ordinances and then force the crown to accept them.
Though primarily active in England, he also had strong connections with the French royal house.
One of the wealthiest and most powerful men of his age, he was a central player in the conflicts between Edward II of England and his nobility, particularly Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster.
Pembroke was one of the Lords Ordainers appointed to restrict the power of Edward II and his favourite Piers Gaveston.
[2] William was Henry III's half-brother through his motherâ€™s prior marriage to King John, and as such gained a central position in the Kingdom of England.
[6] Through inheritance and marriages his lands consisted of â€“ apart from the county palatine in Pembrokeshire â€“ property spread out across England primarily in a strip from Gloucestershire to East Anglia, in south-east Ireland (Wexford), and French lands in the Poitou- and Calais areas.

Lords ordainers
The 'Lords Ordainers' were a commission of twenty-one individuals who in March 1310 were appointed to reform the administration when king Edward II agreed "that certain persons should be elected to ordain and determine the condition of his household and of his realm", and were so called because they "issued ordinances for the better government of the realm".
The pope was persuaded to annul the censures issued by the English church and the king managed to win over his cousin Thomas by appointing him hereditary Steward of England and handed out numerous other favours and grants of land to bring over other notable barons to his side.
Bruce however, refused any deal, allegedly dismissing Edward's proposals with the words "If the King of England will not keep faith with his own subjects, how then will he keep faith with me?"

The second act is a struggle regarding restraint of the crown under the Ordinances of 1311, a series of demands not unlike the Magna Carta or he Provisions of Oxford and Westminster.
Unlike the Provisions of Oxford, the Ordinances still appear in the Statutes of the Realm, despite having been repealed in 1322 The first six Ordinances were passed in 1310.
Unsurprisingly, these ordinances address concerns directly affecting the Church and the barons rather than the commons.
Ordinance IV required that revenues be paid into the exchequer, where they would be under the control of the Barons of the Exchequer.
Taken together, these first six ordinances bind the king to observe his constitutional obligations, and strengthens the power of taxation held by Parliament.
These reforms bear similarities to those of the Provisions of Oxford and Westminster.
The murder of Gaveston brought England to the verge of civil war between the royalists and the barons party under Lancaster.
The barons retorted that England was a nation governed by custom and not by written law.
The Despensers lands in England were forfeited, and the Despensers were exiled.
In September of 1326, Isabella and Mortimer landed in England, ostensibly to avenge Thomas of Lancaster and hold the Despensers accountable.
For the time being, Isabella and Mortimer were the effective rulers of England.
This requirement was a feature of the Paper Constitution of 1244 and the Provisions of Oxford of 1258, neither of which endured.
Neither did the commission created by the Provisions of Oxford command the respect needed to exercise authority over the king.
The Ordinances of 1311 are published, imposing a series of regulations upon King Edward II of England by the peerage and clergy.
Moreover, the imposition of conciliar governance, the effective transfer of political power from the crown to a corporate body, was far more radical than anything envisioned in Magna Carta, and was to reverberate throughout the rest of the middle ages in England.
Failed campaigns in Brittany in 1230 and Poitou in 1242 were bad enough, while even more successful intervention in Gascony was very costly in both financial and personal terms, but Henry's involvement in the so-called Sicilian Business, in which he sought a crown for his younger son Edmund, was the final straw for the developing political opposition in England.
The result of the deliberations of this parliament was the Provisions of Oxford, which Jobson examines in detail.
After delays occasioned by the death of the dauphin and the marriage of Henry's daughter Beatrice, Henry wrote to postpone the Candlemas 1260 parliament, a clear challenge to the Provisions of Oxford.
Following his belated return to England, Henry successfully undermined the conciliar constraints that the Provisions has placed upon his kingship, culminating in a release of his obligations to adhere to any of the recent reforms in a bull of Pope Alexander IV and his settlement with his barons in the Treaty of Kingston in November 1261.
Simon de Montfort's refusal to abide by the terms of the resultant Mise of Amiens, despite his prior commitment to do so, "in order to conserve the Provisions of Oxford, because they were founded on the Charter" (107), illustrates both his commitment to the reform movement and his blindness to his own moral ambiguity.
The peace settlement, the Mise of Lewes, was solidified by the subsequent London parliament of June 1264--which included four knights as representatives of each county--that issued the Ordinatio or Ordinance, which fully embodied the principles of the Provisions of Oxford.
His enforcement of both the Provisions of Oxford and the Provisions of Westminster was populist and popular, but his own self-aggrandizement, both financial and military, was decidedly not.
The homosexual King Edward II and Piers Gaveston
England has had many gay or lesbian monarchs (some definitely, others were just rumoured to be) - King William Rufus (the son of William the Conqueror), King Edward II, King Richard II, Queen Anne, Queen Mary, Richard the Lionheart (the brother of King John of Magna Carta fame), King James I - but it is Edward II who was possibly the most notorious.
Many people in the country weren't too happy about this, and Piers Gaveston was eventually executed by the Earl of Warwick (who Gaveston had called "the black hound of Arden") by having his head chopped off - homosexuality was a capital offence in England at this time.
â€˜Fair of body and great of strengthâ€™, Edward of Caernarfon, Englandâ€™s first Prince of Wales, was widely welcomed when he came into his inheritance as King Edward II at the age of twenty-three.
When he went off to France to marry Isabella in January 1308, a few weeks before the coronation, he placed Gaveston in charge of England, and, to the fury of just about every baron in the land, he also bestowed on him the rich earldom of Cornwall.
The reckless passion of Edward II for Piers Gaveston ranks as the first of the momentous love affairs that have shaken Englandâ€™s monarchy over the centuries.
Homosexuality was deeply disapproved of in medieval England.
But one source referred directly to a rumour going around England that â€˜the King loved an evil male sorcerer more than he did his wife, a most handsome lady and a very beautiful womanâ€™.
Nowadays England might welcome a DIY king, but in the fourteenth century such activities, not to mention the pleasure Edward took in hobnobbing with grooms and ploughmen, were considered abnormal.
When, in an attempt to curb the Kingâ€™s aberrations, Parliament presented him with a set of â€˜Ordinancesâ€™ in 1311, along the lines of Simon de Montfortâ€™s Provisions of Oxford, Edward took the extraordinary step of offering to agree to any restriction on his own powers provided that his favourite was in no way affected.
Building on Magna Carta and the Provisions of Oxford, championed by Simon de Montfort, it was now laid down that the King could not leave the kingdom without the consent of the barons, and that parliaments must be held at least once or twice a year and in a convenient place.
Robert the Bruceâ€™s brave and cunning victory at Bannockburn is one of the great tales of Scottish history, but in England its consequence was a massive further blow to Edwardâ€™s authority.
Once again the barons found themselves rallying together to restrict the power of a royal familiaris â€“ a favourite â€“ and this time a new element came into play.
When Mortimer and Isabella landed in England in 1326, they had only a few hundred men, but they held a trump card â€“ Isabellaâ€™s elder son by Edward, the thirteen-year-old Prince Edward.
England now set about doing something it had never attempted before â€“ the deposition of a king by legal process.
Preaching to them on 15 January 1327, the Archbishop of Canterbury took as his text â€˜Vox populi, Vox deiâ€™ â€“ â€˜The voice of the people is the voice of God.â€™ By the unanimous consent of all the lords, clergy and people, h e announced, King Edward II was deposed from his royal dignity, â€˜never more to govern the people of Englandâ€™, and he would be succeeded by his first-born son, the Lord Edward.
[2][3] She was jailed on account of having ordered an armed assault on Isabella of France, Queen consort of King Edward II of England.
Edward's capture of Leeds Castle was the catalyst which led to the Despenser War in the Welsh Marches and the north of England.
Margaret was born at an unrecorded place in either Ireland or England on or about 1 April 1287, the youngest child of Thomas de Clare, Lord of Thomond and Juliana FitzGerald of Offaly, and granddaughter of Richard de Clare, Earl of Hertford and Gloucester.
[5] Her parents resided in both Ireland and England throughout their marriage;[6] it has never been established where Juliana was residing at the time of Margaret's birth although the date is known.
Badlesmere was appointed steward of King Edward II's household in 1318; a position which brought him much power and influence in the royal council.
He was one of the middle party, which resented the King's favourites, the Despensers, yet also equally opposed Edward's staunch enemies such as his immensely powerful cousin Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, who in addition to having been one of the wealthiest nobles in England, was the leader of the Lords Ordainers.
These men, drawn from the peerage and clergy, were the 21 signatories of the Ordinances of 1311; a series of regulations forced upon the King with the aim of restricting his administrative prerogatives, and setting up a baronial oligarchy in the realm.
Many of the nobles who had previously been hostile to Edward rushed to his side to quell the insurrection of the Marcher Lords, known as the Despenser War, which had erupted in full force after the King defiantly recalled to England the two Despensers (father and son,) whom the Ordainers had compelled him to banish in August 1321.
[29] This act had dire consequences in addition to the Despenser War: it paved the way for the complete domination of the grasping Despensers over Edward and his kingdom, leading to Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella's 1326 Invasion of England, their assumption of power, the execution of the two Despensers, and finally, Edward's deposition.
By this time Edward III had ascended the throne; however, the de facto rulers of England were Queen Isabella and her lover, Marcher Lord Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March (father-in-law of Margaret's daughter Elizabeth), who jointly held the Office of Regent for the new king.

The twentieth Ordinance, which caused Edward the most anguish, mandated the perpetual exile of Piers Gaveston from England, Ireland, Gascony and other lands ruled by the king; this is the only Ordinance cited in full by the Vita Edwardi Secundi, on the grounds that it was "more welcome to many than the rest."
The men I want to focus on are Bourgeois de Tilh and his son Arnaud (Borgois de Tille et seon filz), who (Arnaud) had been appointed marshall of the king's exchequer around Michaelmas 1311 [5], and Bertrand Caillau "and his brother and those of Gascony who are in their company in the parts of Cornwall" (Bertran Kaillon et seon frere et ceux de Gascoigne qe sunt en lur compaignie en les parties de Cornewaille).
Perhaps it was Arnaud Caillau, of whom I have written before, a man who remained staunchly loyal to Edward II until the very end of his reign and who served him in both Gascony (he was, among other positions, keeper of the island of OlÃ©ron) and England.
The reference to the men of Gascony who were in the company of the Caillau brothers in Cornwall presumably means something which happened in the spring of 1312, not long after Piers Gaveston's return to England for a third time.
His son Arnaud was appointed marshal of the exchequer around Michaelmas 1311 at the expense of the earl of Lancaster's retainer Nicholas Segrave, most likely at Piers' request - yet another reason for the powerful earl to dislike Piers.

Edward II King of England
king of England from 1307 to 1327.
With one stroke, Scotland’s independence was virtually secured, and Edward was put at the mercy of a group of barons headed by his cousin Thomas of Lancaster, who by 1315 had made himself the real master of England.
In September 1326 the couple invaded England, executed the Despensers, and deposed Edward in favour of his son, who was crowned (January 1327) King Edward III.
The ordinances of 1311
It has been described as â€˜oligarchicalâ€™; the phrase â€˜community of the realmâ€™ doesnâ€™t appear, the ordinances stress the role of the baronage in parliament.
The ordinances have a number of groups of issues they try to address:
In the end, the ordinances started a period of conflict â€“ between Thomas, Earl of Lancaster and his supporters, and the king, rather than bringing one to an end.
The version of the ordinances below is not complete â€“omissions are marked through lacunae and numbering.
Whereas, through bad and deceitful counsel, our lord the king and all his men have everywhere been dishonoured and his crown in many ways has been debased and ruined, while his lands of Gascony, Ireland, and Scotland are on the point of being lost unless God improves the situation, and his realm of England has been brought to the verge of rebellion through prises and [other] oppressive and destructive measuresâ€”which facts are known and provedâ€”our lord the king of his free will has granted to the prelates, earls, and barons, and to the other good men of his realm, that certain persons should be elected to ordain and determine the condition of his household and of his realm, as appears more fully in the commission issued by our lord the king in this connection.
Therefore we, Robert, by the grace of God archbishop of Canterbury and primate of all England, and the bishops, earls, and barons elected by virtue of the said commission, do ordain for the honour of God and Holy Church and of the king and his realm in the manner following:â€”
Item, it is ordained that the customs of the kingdom shall be received and kept by men of the kingdom itself, and not by aliens ; and that the issues and profits of the same customs, together with all other issues and profits pertaining to the kingdom from any source whatsoever, shall in their entirety come to the king's exchequer and be paid by the treasurer and the chamberlain for maintaining the king's household and [to be spent] in other ways for his benefit ; so that the king may live of his own without taking prises other than those anciently due and accustomed.
Secondly, under Edward I the kings wardrobe had become more and more central to the royal finances, bypassing the exchequer.
14  And whereas many evils have been incurred through [the employment of] such councillors and such ministers, we ordain that the king shall appoint the chancellor, the chief justices of both benches, the treasurer, the chancellor and the chief baron of the exchequer, the steward of the household, the keeper of the wardrobe, the comptroller and a fit clerk to keep the privy seal, a chief keeper of the forests on this side of Trent and one on the other side of Trent, also an escheator on this side of Trent and one on the other side, as well as the king's chief clerk of the common bench, by  the counsel and assent of the baronage, and that in parliament.
17  Moreover, we ordain that sheriffs shall henceforth be appointed by the chancellor, the treasurer, and others of the council who are present; and if the chancellor is not present, let them be appointed by the treasurer, the barons of the exchequer, and the justices of the bench.
20   Because it is known, and by examination by the prelates, earls and barons, knights and other good people of the kingdom found, that Piers Gavaston has acted badly towards and has badly advised our lord the king and has incited him to do wrong in divers and deceptive ways; in taking possession of for himself all the king's treasure and sending it out of the kingdom; in drawing to himself royal power and royal dignity, as in making alliances on oath with people to live and die with him against all men, and this by the treasure he acquires from day to day; in lording it over the estate of the king and of the crown, to the ruin of the king and of the people; and especially in estranging the heart of the king from his lieges; in despising their counsels, not allowing good officers to carry out the law of the land; in removing good officers, appointing those of his own gang, as well aliens as others, who at his will and command offend against right and the law of the land; in taking the king's lands, tenements and bailiwicks to himself and his heirs; and has Caused the king to give lands and tenements of his crown to divers people to the great loss and diminution of the estate of the king and of his crown, and this as well since the ordinance that the king granted to the ordainers to act for the profit of himself and his people as before against the ordinance of the ordainers ; and in maintaining robbers and murderers and getting for them the king's charter of his peace, in emboldening wrongdoers to do worse, and in taking the king into a land where there is war without the common assent of his baronage to the danger of his person and the ruin of the kingdom, and in causing blank charters under the great seal of the king to be sealed to the deceit and disinheritance of the king and of his crown, and against his homage; and feloniously, falsely and traitorously has done the aforesaid things to the great dishonour and loss of the king and disinheriting of the crown and to the ruin of his people in many ways:  And in addition to this we having regard to what was done by the most noble king, the father of the present king, by whose adjudgment the aforesaid Piers abjured the realm of England and whose will it was that our lord the king, his son, should abjure forever his company, and that since by the common assent of all the realm and of the king and of the same prelates, earls and barons it was heretofore adjudged that he should leave the said realm, and he did leave it, and that his return was never by common assent, but only by the assent of some individuals who agreed to it on condition of his behaving well after his return: and now his bad conduct is established beyond doubt, for which conduct and for the great wickednesses aforementioned and for the many others that could befall our lord the king and his people, and in order to foster good understanding between the king and his people and avoid many kinds of discords and dangers, We ordain, by virtue of the commission our lord the king granted us, that Piers Gavaston as the evident enemy of the king and of his people be completely exiled as well from the kingdom of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales as from the 'whole lordship of our lord the king overseas as well as on this side, forever without ever returning; and that he leave the kingdom of England and all the aforesaid lands and absolutely all the lordship of our lord the king between now and the feast of All Saints next to come; and we assign to him as port in the way aforesaid Dover and nowhere else for crossing and leaving.
And if the said Piers stays in the kingdom of England or anywhere else in the lordship of our lord the king beyond the said day that has been given him for leaving and crossing as is aforesaid, then let there be done with him as would be done with the enemy of the king and of the kingdom and of his people.
21   Also we ordain that Amerigo and those of the company of Frescobaldi come to the accounting in the way that was ordained and published, notwithstanding the account they say they have rendered, within the fortnight after next Michaelmas and in the meantime let there be arrested all the persons and all the goods of members of the company of Frescobaldi that can be found in the power of the king of England, and that all the lands of the said Amerigo be seized into the hand of the king whereso-ever they are in the said power of the king.
22   Also because sir Henry de Beaumont has received from our lord the king to the loss ,and dishonour of the king, since the time of the ordinance of the ordainers to which the king agreed, the kingdom of Man and other lands, rents, liberties and bailiwicks and has caused lands and tenements liberties and bailiwicks to be given to others contrary to this ordinance, and because he has badly advised the king contrary to his oath, We ordain that he be removed from the king's counsel for ever and that he come no more near the king anywhere â€” unless it be at the common summons of parliament or in war if the king wishes to have him â€” save by common assent of the archbishop, bishops, earls and barons and that in full parliament; and all the other lands that he holds within the kingdom of England be taken into the hand of the king of England and held until the king has received from the issues of these lands the value of all the yield that the said sir Henry has had from the lands received co4rary to the said ordinance, and if the said sir Henry in any point contravenes these ordinances let him be disinherited forever of all the lands that he has in England of the king's gift.
24 And whereas the people feel much aggrieved because of divers debts demanded of them for the king's use by summons from the exchequer, of which debts, being actually paid, the people have various acquittances . . . ; we ordain that henceforth in the account of every sheriff, or other minister of the king who is answerable at the ex-chequer, such tallies, writs, and franchises as are allowable in the account shall be allowed. . . . And if the treasurer and the barons of the exchequer do not act in the manner aforesaid, the plaintiffs shall enjoy [the right of] recovery through petition in parliament.
25  Whereas ordinary merchants and many others of the people are allowed to bring pleas of debt and trespass in the exchequer, through the fact that they are received by the ministers of the said court more favourably than they should beâ€”whereby accounts and other concerns of the king are greatly delayed and, in addition, a large number of people are aggrievedâ€”we ordain that henceforth no pleas shall be held in the said court of the exchequer except pleas touching the king and his ministers : [namely] those answerable at the exchequer by reason of their offices, the ministers of the court  itself, and their subordinates and servants who most of the time are with them in those places where the exchequer may be.
31  Item, we ordain that all statutes which were made in amendment of the law and for the benefit of the people by the ancestors of our lord the king shall be kept and maintained as heretofore in accordance with law and right, provided that they are not contrary to the Great Charter or to the Forest Charter or to the ordinances by us made.
39  Item, we ordain that the chancellor, the Treasurer, the chief  justices of both benches, the chancellor of the exchequer, the treasurer of the wardrobe, the steward of the king' household, and all justices, sheriffs, escheators, constables, investigators for any cause whatsoever, and all other bailiffs and ministers of the king, whenever they receive their offices and bailiwicks, shall be sworn to keep and observe all the ordinances made by the prelates, earls, and barons for that purpose elected and assignedâ€”[to maintain] every one of those [ordinances] without contravening them in any particular.
40  Item, we ordain that in each parliament one bishop, two earls, and two barons shall be assigned to hear and determine all plaints of those wishing to complain of the king's ministers, whichever they may be, who have contravened the ordinances aforesaid.
And those who are found to have contravened the said ordinances, in the interest of the king and in the interest of the plaintiffs, shall be punished at the discretion of the persons thus assigned.
41  Item, we ordain that the aforesaid ordinances are to be maintained and observed in all their particulars, and that our lord the king shall cause them to be issued under his great seal and sent into every county of England, to be published, held, and strictly kept as well within franchises as without. . . .
These ordinances, having been shown to us and published on Monday next before the feast of St. Michael just past, we agree to, accept, and confirm.
And we will and grant, for us and our heirs, that all and several of the said ordinances, made according to the form of our letters aforesaid, shall be published throughout our entire realm, henceforth to be strictly maintained and observed.

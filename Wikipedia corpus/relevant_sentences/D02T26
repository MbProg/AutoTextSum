Clinton  Engineer Works

Within a year, promising research at several universities, particularly at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, showed that it was possible to produce atomic bombs based on the chain-reacting fission of uranium 235 isotope or of plutonium.
Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves directed and coordinated the Project from 1942 to 1945, spending 2.3 billion dollars on nuclear reactors and chemical separation plants at Hanford, Washington, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and on the weapon research and design laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico.
The first plutonium bomb was successfully detonated at Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945.
The B-29 bomber Enola Gay exploded the first uranium bomb, "Little Boy," over Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945; the B-29 Bock's Car exploded the second plutonium bomb, "Fat Man," over Nagasaki, Japan, two days later.
Goldberg examined the research and technologies necessary to realize the uranium and plutonium bombs.
Between January 1987 and June 1990 the sessions were recorded on-site or in-studio in Hanford, Washington; Boston, Massachusetts; Oak Ridge and Louisville, Tennessee; Alamogordo and Los Alamos, New Mexico; Washington, D.C.; and Suitland, Maryland.
The sessions are divided into five collection divisions: Hanford, Oak Ridge, Cambridge, Los Alamos, and Alberta.
Interviewees in this collection contributed in various roles to the refinement of plutonium 239 isotope at the Hanford Engineer Works in the state of Washington.
In January of 1943, General Groves chose the site for construction of three full-scale plutonium piles for the mass production of plutonium 239--an isotope for the chain reaction in an atomic bomb--as well as water-treatment plants for cooling the reactors.
The E.I. Du Pont de Nemours Company also built four remote-controlled "canyons" for the chemical separation of plutonium from uranium 238.
Wakefield A. Wright and Vivian Russell Chapman were first transferred from Alabama Ordnance Works by Du Pont to the Manhattan Project facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for training before arriving in Hanford in 1944.
He came to Hanford in October 1944, from the Separations Development Division at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
During World War II Frederic W. Albaugh worked in the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago as a group leader in the plutonium chemistry section.
He arrived in Hanford to head its plutonium chemistry section in 1947 and continued to work there in various administrative capacities until 1971.

Interviewees in this collection contributed in various roles to the refinement of uranium 235 isotope at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
Participants for Session Four were instrumental in designing and running the nuclear reactors at Oak Ridge and Hanford.
Du Pont employed his services as a research chemist until 1942, when he became a technical specialist on the explosive potential of plutonium.
In 1943 he was appointed chief physicist of the Clinton Laboratories near Oak Ridge, where he remained until 1946.
He stayed there during the war at the Metallurgical Laboratory and moved to Oak Ridge in 1945.
He trained cubicle and vacuum pump operators and remained after 1945 in the effort to maximize calutron output.
She also worked part-time for the Oak Ridge Journal.
George M. Banic, Jr., worked on high voltage power supplies for the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York, and came to Oak Ridge in March 1944, to help with the stable isotope program.
Larson took charge of the technical staff at the Y-12 plant at Oak Ridge through 1950 when he became director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratories.
Livingston oversaw Stone and Webster Engineering Corporation's design of the Y-12 Plant and continued working at Oak Ridge until his retirement in 1981.
He started work at Oak Ridge as a process chemist in the summer of 1944, assisting in the recycling of uranium waste.
Keim continued working at Oak Ridge until his retirement in 1971.
Vanstrum began working for Union Carbide Corporation, the K-25 operating contractor, after graduation and transferred to Oak Ridge in August 1944.
Parsons continued to work on the manufacture of diffusion barriers in New York until September 1944, when he went to Oak Ridge as a foreman.
Paul Huber also had a degree in chemical engineering and began work at Oak Ridge in 1944.
Goldberg focused discussions on the theory and practice of reactor construction; nature of the workload; living conditions; and security measures at Oak Ridge.

Oak Ridge
Oak Ridge, city (1990 pop.
27,310), Anderson and Roane counties, E Tenn., on Black Oak Ridge and the Clinch River; founded by the U.S. government 1942, inc. as an independent city 1959.
For years Oak Ridge was used by the federal government to pursue activities in the fields of atomic energy and nuclear physics.
The site was chosen (1942) for what was called the Clinton Engineer Works, and the city was built to house the workers who developed the uranium-235 and plutonium-239 for the atomic bomb.
The community's existence was kept secret from most of the country until the summer of 1945.
The former Clinton National Laboratory for nuclear research became (1948) the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
In the 1990s the federal government began decontaminating and leasing much of the complex to private industry, and one section was renamed the East Tennessee Technology Park.
The Oak Ridge Associated Universities, a consortium of many educational institutions, manages the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education.

Joseph William Kennedy (May 30, 1916 â€“ May 5, 1957) was an American chemist who was a co-discoverer of plutonium, along with Glenn T. Seaborg, Edwin McMillan and Arthur Wahl.
During World War II he was head of the CM (Chemistry and Metallurgy) Division at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory, where he oversaw research onto the chemistry and metallurgy of uranium and plutonium.
In February 1940, Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan produced plutonium-239 through the bombardment of uranium.
In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed the creation of neptunium, element 93, which then underwent beta-decay to form a new element, plutonium, with 94 protons.
[4] Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters to verify the presence of plutonium.
He used mica sliced razor thin to produce a window to count alpha particle emissions, and ionization chamber with a magnetic field to separate the beta particles from the neptunium from alpha particles from the plutonium.
On March 28, 1941, Seaborg, physicist Emilio SegrÃ¨ and Kennedy were able to demonstrate not only the presence of plutonium, but that was fissile, an important distinction that was crucial to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research.
[8] The chemistry and metallurgy of uranium was fairly well known, although it did yield a few surprises, but that of plutonium was almost completely unknown.
This competition ended abruptly when SegrÃ¨'s group at Los Alamos discovered that high levels of a hitherto undiscovered plutonium-240 isotope in reactor-produced plutonium meant that an implosion-type nuclear weapon was required, and a high degree of purity was therefore unnecessary.
[10] While the chemists worked out how to purify plutonium, the metallurgists had to figure out how to cast it into a solid sphere.
Eric Jette's CM-8 (Uranium and Plutonium Metallurgy) group found that they could stabilise plutonium in its malleable Î´ phase by alloying it with gallium.
In 1945, Kennedy was recruited as a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, and was installed as Chairman of the Department of Chemistry in 1946, a role he continued in until his death.

Manhatten project: Oak Ridge
The mission of the Oak Ridge facility in Tennessee was to produce enriched uranium for the first atomic bombs.
Originally called the Clinton Engineer Works, Oak Ridge was expanded and renamed in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project.
The Oak Ridge site was selected because the Clinch River provided ample supplies of water, nearby Knoxville was a good source of labor, and the TVA could supply the huge amounts of electricity needed.
A third facility known as X-10 housed a graphite plutonium production reactor and the facilities needed to extract the plutonium from the irradiated fuel.
he Oak Ridge X-10 Site
The original portion of the Oak Ridge facility, built in 1942 as the Clinton Engineer Works, is known as X-10, comprising 2,900 acres in Melton and Bethel Valleys, 10 miles southwest of the City of Oak Ridge, 20 miles west of Knoxville, TN.
In 1943, the facility name was changed to Oak Ridge.
The Manhattan Project plan was to create two atomic weapons--one fueled by plutonium, the other by enriched uranium.
Hanford, Washington, was selected as the site for plutonium production, but before a facility could be built there, the X-10 pilot plant was necessary to prove the feasibility of scaling up from laboratory experiments.
The Graphite Reactor was built for this purpose in only 11 months, designed to show that plutonium could be extracted from irradiated uranium slugs.
Four months later, Oak Ridge chemists produced the world's first few grams of plutonium.
The Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant
Construction on Y-12 began in February 1943 to implement the electromagnetic separation method, with first production in November of the same year (although construction continued through 1945).
Tennessee Eastman took over operation of Y-12 in June 1943.
The Oak Ridge K-25 Site
The K-25 Site occupies a 1,700-acre area adjacent to the Clinch River, approximately 13 miles west of Oak Ridge.
The K-25 Plant was authorized in late 1942, and was the last of the big Oak Ridge sites to become operational.
K-25 was huge, even by Oak Ridge standards, with fifty four-story buildings totaling 2,000,000 square feet, in a U-shape measuring a 2,600 feet long by 1,000 feet wide.
Covering some 44 acres, the K-25 building was the world's largest roofed structure when it was completed in March 1945.
Oak Ridge Y-12
That problem was not solved until 1944 enabling production in 1945.
This was an enormous gamble with fantastic sums of money and scarce resources being poured into the Oak Ridge project.
(2015) - A short film about the current State of Nuclear power plants in the world.
The results showed that, with a lightly enriched uranium, criticality could be reached.
When President Roosevelt in December 1942 authorized the Manhattan Project, the Oak Ridge site in eastern Tennessee had already been obtained for the Clinton Engineer Works and plans had been laid for establishing an air-cooled experimental pile, a pilot chemical separation plant, and support facilities.
The reactor used neutrons emitted in the fission of uranium-235 to convert uranium-238 into a new element, plutonium-239.
Also Known As: Oak Ridge Area, Oak Ridge Reservation
State: Tennessee
Location: Oak Ridge
Government purchased 59,000 acres 12 miles west of Knoxville, Tennessee because it needed a remote location to build production plants and laboratories to produce plutonium and enriched uranium for the atomic bomb project.
This facility was known as the Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) and was referred to generally as Oak Ridge.
The entire CEW was bounded by security fences from February 1943 through March 1949.
Within the CEW were the processing plants, known as Y-12, K-25 and X-10 (now ORNL) each of which had its own security fence (a fence within a fence) and has been designated separately for purposes of the EEOIPCA.
During this time, Roane Anderson Company managed, operated and maintained residences, apartment, dormitories, guest houses, barracks, hutments, trailers, restaurants, cafeterias, buses, roads, streets, sidewalks, garbage and sewage disposal, heating plants and more for the CEW.
The CEW gates came down in March 1949.
This meant that people no longer needed a security clearance to enter the CEW, though clearances were still required to enter the plants and laboratories.
It was also in 1949 that the privatization of what is today known as the City of Oak Ridge began.
One of the first production facilities built for the Manhattan Project was located west of Knoxville, Tennessee on a military reservation called the Clinton Engineer Works.
All three production sites at Clinton Engineer Works were built to extract plutonium and were located in valleys to contain potential explosions and for security reasons.
Plans originally called for the construction of housing for about 13,000 workers, however by 1943, this estimate was tripled and by the end of WWII, the facility was the fifth largest town in Tennessee and consumed 1/7 of all the power produced in the United States.
Following WWII, the facility was renamed Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
The SEC classes for Clinton Engineer Works include all employees of the Tennessee Eastman Corporation (1943â€“1947) and the Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation (1947â€“1949) who were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, from January 1, 1943 through December 31, 1949 for a number of work days aggregating at least 250 work days, occurring either solely under this employment or in combination with work days within the parameters established for one or more classes of employees included in the Special Exposure Cohort.
Clinton Engineer Works was located in both Roane and Anderson Counties, Tennessee.
The facility was a 59,000-acre federal government area which hosted three main operating units concerned with atomic energy work (two U-235 production plants and a nuclear research center) as well as the community of Oak Ridge (see Figure 5-1).
The population of CEW, concentrated chiefly in Oak Ridge, reached a peak of about 75,000 in the summer ofâ€™ 1945.
The employment peak of 82,000 was reached in May 1945.
The primary contractor (Roane-Anderson Company) had a peak employment of nearly 10,000 in September 1945, declining to about 2,400 by September 1947 (Manhattan, 1947a, pdf p. 20).
The operating units within Clinton Engineer Works were the gaseous diffusion plant for the production of U-235 (K-25), operated for the Atomic Energy Commission by the Carbide & Carbon Chemicals Corporation; the electromagnetic plant for the production of U-235 (Y-12), operated from 1943-1947 by the Tennessee Eastman Corporation and after 1947 by the Carbide & Carbon Chemicals Corporation (also known as the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation); and the Clinton Laboratories, now a nuclear research center (X-10), which served during the war as a pilot plant for the construction of the huge plutonium process buildings at Hanford Engineer Works in the State of Washington.
Near the gaseous diffusion plant, there was also a high-temperature, high-pressure, variable-frequency steam power plant, which has generating equipment with a capacity of 238,000 kilowatts (equal to the capacity of Norris Dam of the TVA).
The site for Clinton Engineer Works was selected on Sept. 19, 1942, by representatives of the Manhattan Engineer District (MED) (established August 13, 1942) and the Stone & Webster Engineering Corporation ofâ€™ Boston, which later had the contract for the construction ofâ€™ the town of Oak Ridge and the electromagnetic plant (Manhattan, 1947a, pdf p. 28).
The area is approximately eight miles from the town of Clinton, the town for which CEW was originally named, about 18 miles from the city of Knoxville, and about 20 miles from Norris Dam.
The city of Oak Ridge was constructed by the U.S. Government to provide living accommodations for CEW personnel.
The city occupied approximate1y eight square miles in the northeast corner of the CEW site.
The city site is a hilly, wooded section 1.25 mi1es wide and 6.75 miles long bounded on the north by the ridge and on the south by the Oak Ridge Turnpike, the main artery through CEW.
The turnpike was part of U.S. Highway 61 before the CEW project started (CEW Facts, 1947, pdf p. 18).
CEW reservation security was initially provided by forces from Stone and Webster.
On October 11, 1943, responsibility for Y-12 plant security as well as the reservation guard houses, was transferred to Tennessee Eastman Corporation (Covington, 1943).

Of the three primary sites â€” Los Alamos, New Mexico; Hanford, Washington; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee â€” the latter has always captured my interest because of its moniker â€œThe Secret City.â€
The Manhattan Engineer District built an entirely new military reservation on 59,000 acres in an isolated area of rural Tennessee.
Clinton Engineer Works, the Armyâ€™s name for the Oak Ridge Manhattan Project site during World War II, hosted the Projectâ€™s uranium enrichment plants (K-25 and Y-12) and the pilot plutonium production reactor (X-10).
I convinced my sister, a fellow history buff who had also recently read Kiernanâ€™s book, to take an atomic-inspired road trip to eastern Tennessee.
Completed in 1936, the powerful Norris Dam played a significant role in the success of the Project in Oak Ridge.
Driving to Oak Ridge, I passed through the adjacent town of Clinton and instantly made the connection to Clinton Engineer Works.
Driving southwest on Tennessee 61, the roadway curved and bended around the Clinch River.
Later during our trip, we traveled to Norris Dam, a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Dam constructed as part of the Works Progress Administration.
Located upstream of the Clinch River, Norris Dam is part of the Projectâ€™s story in Oak Ridge.
During the summer, the Department of Energy (DOE), in partnership with the AMSE, host bus tours of the DOE Oak Ridge sites.
The tour includes the three main historic sites at the Oak Ridge reservation: Y-12, X-10, and K-25.
When I think of Oak Ridge and the Project, I see black-and-white images of women on stools monitoring knobs.
These iconic photos capture the thousands of women involved in the project at Oak Ridge.

After passing through the security gates, we entered the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
We learned that scientists from around the world visit Oak Ridge to use the ORNL during a brief drive-by of the Spallation Neutron Source.
The space is remarkably well preserved, even though plutonium production ended in 1963.
During our visit to Oak Ridge, the demolition of K-25 was nearly complete.
The bus tour took us around the site, with dense trees providing a modest boundary for the East Tennessee Technology Park.
Although we scheduled our trip around the DOE Sites Public Bus Tour, we learned that the story about Oak Ridge was just as compelling in areas outside the modern-day reservation.
We ate in Jackson Square, the historic townsite of Oak Ridge.
We instantly recognized other Oak Ridge landmarks of note within the vicinity, including the Chapel-on-the-Hill and the Guest House (Alexander Inn).
However, this was the true cultural center for those working at Oak Ridge, where the Army attempted to provide some normalcy for its isolated community.
These simple, minimally sized homes provided housing for predominately white families working in Oak Ridge during the Project years.

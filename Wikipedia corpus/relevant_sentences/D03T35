Pendle Witches

Perhaps the most notorious witch trial of the 17th century, the legend of the Pendle witches is one of the many dark tales of imprisonment and execution at Lancaster Castle.
Twelve people were accused of witchcraft; one died while held in custody, eleven went to trial.
Only one was found not guilty.
Also, just over three centuries saw witch trials held in England but fewer than 500 people were executed for this crime.
This one series of trials in the summer of 1612 therefore accounts for 2% of all witches executed.
It is important to understand the background to the events of these trials.
The extent of the spate of witchcraft reported in Pendle at this time perhaps reflected the large amounts of money people could make by posing as witches.
Indeed, it was a time when witchcraft was not only feared but also fascinated those from common village folk to King James I. James I had been greatly interested in witchcraft even before he took the throne (in 1603), writing a book, Daemonologie, instructing his readers to condemn and prosecute both supporters and practitioners of witchcraft.
The scepticism of the king became reflected in the feelings of unrest about witchcraft among the common people.
The kingâ€™s views were also imposed on the law; each Justice of the Peace in Lancashire at the beginning of the year of 1612 were instructed to compile a list of all those who refused to attend Church or take communion (a criminal offence).
During the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the people of Pendle Hill openly opposed the closure of the nearby Cistercian Abbey and reverted straight back to Catholicism when Queen Mary came to the throne in 1553.
It was with this background of unease that the two judges made their investigations and sentenced the Pendle witches.
It was upon further questioning that Alizon accused her grandmother, Old Demdike, and also members of the Chattox family, of witchcraft.
The deaths of four other villagers that had occurred years before the trial were raised and the blame laid on witchcraft performed by Chattox.
The trials were held at Lancaster between 17th and 19th August 1612.
Nine year old Jennet Device was a key supplier of evidence for the Pendle witchesâ€™ trial which was allowed under the system from King James; all normal rules of evidence could be suspended for witch trials, someone so young would not have been able to supply key evidence normally.
Some of the Pendle witches seemed to be genuinely convinced of their guilt whereas others fought to clear their names.
In conclusion, it seemed to be a range of exceptional circumstances that led to the extent of these witch trials.
Indeed, Lancashire was exceptional in the number of witch trials that were held, in comparison to other regions who experienced the same degree of social depravity.
The money that could be made from claiming powers in witchcraft in the 17th century probably caused the declarations made by the two families; they may have been in competition for the best reputation in the area.
This backfired and the wild accusations escalated, fuelled by a general feeling of unrest and fear of witchcraft across the country, making this the biggest and most notorious witch trial.
On August 20th 1612 ten people convicted of witchcraft at the Summer Assize held in Lancaster Castle went to the gallows on the moors above the town.
Their crimes included laming, causing madness and what was termed "simple" witchcraft.
On March 18th 1612 a young woman by the name of Alison Device was out begging on the road to Colne.
Alison was new to the art of witchcraft, indeed she seems to have resisted being indoctrinated into what was in effect the family business.
The most famous of the Pendle witches actually died before coming to trial.
In so doing she also implicated many of her co-accused, as did Anne Whittle ("Old Chattox") who was herself accused of the murder by witchcraft of Robert Nutter.
Also implicated were members of both their families: Elizabeth Device, Demdike's daughter, was accused of two murders, as was her son James, while Alison was to stand trial for what she had done to John Law on that fateful spring day five months before.
Others were dragged into the affair: John and Jane Bulcock, a mother and her son, were tried for causing madness, and for being at a so-called Witches Sabbath held at Malkin Tower on Good Friday 1612; Alice Nutter from Roughlee Hall, was accused of killing one Henry Mitton because he refused to give Demdike a penny; Margaret Pearson was accused of bewitching one of her neighbour's horses to death, and Katherine Hewitt was accused of the murder of Ann Foulds.
The trials commenced on Tuesday 18th August with Sir Edward Bromley presiding.
She stood charged with three counts of murder, accusations she vehemently denied.
Although nothing to do with the Pendle case this trial is extremely interesting, because it hints at a hidden agenda behind all the trials.
Three women were accused of practising witchcraft on the person of Grace Sowerbutts, a teenage girl who was related to the defendants.
It was illegal to aid or assist a witch, and this was enough in 1612, along with other hearsay evidence, to seal the fate of both defendants.
Alizon Device was the last of the Pendle witches to be tried.
Isobel Roby, from Windle, also stood trial on charges of witchcraft at this Assize, and she too was convicted.
On August 20th 1612 the ten condemned prisoners were taken to the moors above the town and hanged.
The trials in Lancaster in August 1612 are among the most famous witchcraft trials in history.
Politics and religion played their part in the prosecutions and convictions in Lancaster in 1612, but the inescapable fact remains that at the end of the day ten people lost their lives, found guilty of a crime that no longer even officially exists.
Julia Bradbury visits Pendle in Lancashire, site of one of English history's horrible periods in which women (and a few men) were persecuted and even executed for witchcraft, which in reality was just herbal and alternative medicine.
The Witch Trials - Pendle Witch Trials (England, 1612 - 1634)
The Pendle Witch Trials, part of the more extensive Lancashire Witch Trials, are among the most famous witch trials in English history, as well as some of the best recorded of the 17th Century.
The original twelve accused all lived in the area around Pendle Hill in Lancashire, England, a wild and lawless region at that time.
Roger Nowell, the local Justice of the Peace, was required in 1612 to compile a list of recusants in the area (those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, which was then a criminal offence) and, at the same time, a claim was brought by a Halifax peddler named John Law against Alizon Device of Pendle, accusing her of causing a stroke by witchcraft.
During questioning, however, more members of the family became implicated, as well as members of another family, the Chattoxes, who were also reputedly involved in witchcraft in the Pendle area, and who were rivals and competitors of the Device family, as well as several others who were merely acquaintances of the families.
The twelve were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of witchcraft, and ten of the twelve were tried at Lancaster Assizes in August 1612, in a group that also included the Salmesbury witches (Jane Southworth, Jennet Brierley, and Ellen Brierley, who were charged with child murder and cannibalism), Margaret Pearson (the so-called Padiham Witch, who was facing her third trial for witchcraft, this time for killing a horse), and Isobel Robey (from Windle, accused of using witchcraft to cause sickness).
The trials have become known collectively as the Lancashire Witch Trials.
Of the eleven individuals who went to trial (nine women and two men) ten were found guilty and executed by hanging, and only one (Alice Gray) was found not guilty.
Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness for the prosecution (giving evidence against members of her own family), something that would not have been permitted in many other 17th Century criminal trials, but King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his â€œDaemonologieâ€.
Several years later, having played her part in the deaths of her mother, brother and sister, Jennet Device found herself accused of witchcraft as well.
Her subsequent declaration contains all the classic ingredients of a witchcraft confession, including her description of selling her soul to a demon called Mamilian.
They were not therefore executed, and remained incarcerated in Lancaster Gaol, where it is likely they died.
These later Lancashire witchcraft trials were the subject of the contemporary play by Thomas Heywood and Richard Brome, â€œThe Late Lancashire Witchesâ€.
Pendle Hill, which dominates the landscape of the area, continues to be associated with witchcraft, and hosts a hilltop gathering every Halloween.
We learn that the play - which Tomkyns defines as a â€˜new comedyâ€™, not a history or chronicle, despite the pamphlet literature available on Lancashire witchcraft - ran for at least three days in a row, a surprising fact in itself.
And Tomkyns duly lists all the amazing kinds of magic attributed to these women in the play, although such magic had been a staple of witchcraft plays since Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay, Endymion, and The Old Wives Tale.
Lancashire was the site of two wildly publicized witchcraft events in the early seventeenth century: the trials of the so-called Pendle witches in 1612 and the later trials of 1633/4.
In the 1612 case, nine-year-old Jennet Device, or Davies, gave evidence against members of her own family - her grandmother (Old Demdike), her mother, her sister, and her brother - as well as against neighbours.
In the 1612 case, of the sixteen who faced trial (Old Demdike died in Lancaster Castle prison before the prosecution), eleven were found guilty, of whom ten were hanged, and one suffered the lesser penalty of standing in the pillory and making public confessions in various locations.
Both of these related cases were reported in Thomas Pottsâ€™s â€˜officialâ€™ case study of the trials, The Wonderful Discovery of Witches in the County of Lancaster, a document that conveys a certain urgency about controlling witchcraft belief and Roman Catholic subversions (the Gunpowder Plot to blow up king and parliament occurred only seven years earlier, and the same man, Sir Thomas Knyvet, who helped thwart that plot, also commissioned Pottsâ€™s pamphlet).
The result, however, proved nothing, since Device could not relieve his illness, and neither could any other accused witch.n9943 That is, although the refusal of charity and consequent cursing seem to have caused John Law to fall ill, in fact he just as likely had a pre-existing condition; there is no evidence that his collapse was caused by witchcraft, although it may have been caused by his fear, translated into physical trauma, of arguing with a woman suspected as a witch.
Although the motives for witchcraft accusations or practices might be multiple, the weight of blame tended to fall on those who could least defend themselves.
In the 1612 â€˜voluntary Confession and Examination of Anne Whittle, alias Chattoxâ€™, Potts records the following, in reviewing evidence of the plan to murder young Robert Nutter by witchcraft, suborned by Elizabeth Nutter, who wanted to see her husbandâ€™s estate pass to her own kin, but complicated for the witch in question by young Nutterâ€™s threats against Chattoxâ€™s daughter:
Potts implies that the death is a direct result of a witchcraft attack, but in fact Nutter lived for another three months, and the death itself provides no evidence except that it followed, albeit at a distance, a witchâ€™s curse - a logical error of post hoc, ergo propter hoc thinking.
As Jonathan Lumby suggests, family trauma can seem to support witchcraft accusations although the one may have little to do with the other, and more to do with other social or economic circumstances.
The inequities of the 1612 trials, especially the resulting high number of executions, demonstrate problems of class warfare, domestic embarrassment, emotional responses to events, possible ulterior motives, and later justifications of those responses and motives as attempts to recover face, both on the part of the accused, the witnesses, and the magistrates themselves.n9945
By contrast, the trials of 1634 with which the play concerns itself were resolved without executions, although some of the accused witches died in prison before and after their exoneration.
The trials did not have a Potts to record the â€˜officialâ€™ view, but despite the lack of detailed documentation, enough remains to be clear about the story itself.
After four witches were executed in 1633, setting the scene, as it were, for the 1634 case, young Edmund Robinson accused almost twenty people of witchcraft; another sixty were suspected as a result.
Bishop Bridgeman believed Mary Spencerâ€™s report of the game she used to play while doing her chores, when he questioned her about transporting her pail by witchcraft, one of the charges against her:
when she was a young girl and went to the well for water, she used to trundle the collock, or pail, down the hill, and she would run after it to overtake it, and did overtake it sometimes, and then she might call it to come to her, but utterly denies that she could ever make it come to her by any witchcraft.n9959
On 15 June 1634 Mary Fisher corroborated the Dickiesonsâ€™ testimony, asserting in her deposition that Robinson wanted the Dickiesons to pay him 40 shillings to drop the witchcraft charges, but that Goody Dickieson refused to let her husband pay.
The boyâ€™s slackness in doing so was the beginning of the 1634 witchcraft trials.
Although the play refers to events of the 1634 trials in Lancaster, the play itself, as the prologue and epilogue make clear, sums up the evidence while the witches and their accusers were being re-examined in London.
n9963 Although the play retells some of the events recorded in the Lancaster trials and invents more, largely as evidence of the credulity of northerners, the expectation in London - where the verdict was not yet announced by the time the play was performed in mid-August - was as the epilogue suggests: â€˜Perhaps great mercy may / ... give them day / Of longer lifeâ€™ [LW 5.
Male endearments for women, such as â€˜coneyâ€™ or â€˜cunnyâ€™ (rabbit) and â€˜mousieâ€™ or â€˜mawsyâ€™ (the name of one familiar in the play), have sexual implications.n9965 Arthur immediately assumes that the hare is female and that witchcraft has rendered it invisible.
They jeer him as a witch and as a bastard of a â€˜lusty youngâ€™ and â€˜wantonâ€™ witch, thus explicitly connecting witchcraft with sexuality, a common early modern trope.
According to Malleus Maleficarum, the locus classicus of witchcraft beliefs: â€˜All witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which is in women insatiableâ€™; the argument rests on Eve, blamed for original sin, and on such biblical passages as Proverbs 30, which asserts of women: â€˜for the sake of fulfilling their lusts they consort with devilsâ€™.
In 4.3 a skimmington ride uses a horse, but the result of the skimmington is an unexpected reversal; as is also the case in 4.4, when Mistress Generous tells the story of her transformation in the stable to the other witches, laughing at the ease with which her husband believes her duplicitous promise to repent and leave witchcraft: â€˜but once and ever / A witch, thou knowâ€™stâ€™ [LW 4.4.
One of the things witchcraft readers and spectators have to keep in mind is the principle of inversion at work in all parts of this play.
At issue here is the credibility of what Stuart Clark calls â€˜the language of early modern witchcraft beliefsâ€™.
n9968 He warns that we should not assume that believers in witchcraft are irrational and perhaps therefore suitable subjects for comedy - a possibility that London playwrights played on with their audiences, contrasting the sophistication of the south with the rusticity of the north.
The key factor in such witchcraft stories is â€˜the stress on contrariness and inverse behaviourâ€™ expected in representations of the demonic, especially those that identify and contrast the key conditions of order and disorder, and whose intelligibility depends on the success of audiences able to interpret a feature of witchcraft as â€˜an actual or symbolic inversion of a traditional form of lifeâ€™.
So, in terms of performance and understanding the impact of this scene and the other witchcraft scenes that show interaction with mere humans, the first question is: how frightened is the boy?
In the light of the playâ€™s implicit sceptical message that witchcraft is in the eyes of the beholders, it is crucial that the human actors are still visible as such in the bestial transformations.
Traditionally the ill-used husband and his ill-using wife must conform to community standards, following their public humiliation; instead, this husband and wife destroy the credibility of the skimmington ride, rejecting it as a vehicle for personal criticism, and Arthur praises Parnell on behalf of the local gentry and farmers: â€˜Parnell, thou didst bravely.â€™ So, her female superiority is intact, and her husbandâ€™s marital equipment is about to be restored with the undoing of Mallâ€™s wedding gift, the knotted cod-piece point that rendered him impotent - the important fact of witchcraft mischief that Doughty finally recognizes.
n9975 And, in fact, the Lancaster witches were reprieved, not executed, and after their re-examination in London, exonerated, although they continued to be kept in Lancaster Castle on their return from London in December, 1634, apparently for their own protection, and were still there in 1637.
In later acts of similar caution or self-restraint, he discredits Robinâ€™s story of how the wine was brought from his favourite London tavern, and distances himself from his wifeâ€™s story of repentance for witchcraft; in the first instance, he is wrong (the evidence of the receipt), but in the second his suspicions are confirmed by his wifeâ€™s continued absence during the night, and by the soldierâ€™s evidence.
A more direct case of inversion appears in the Seely family woes, in which the hierarchy of domestic rule has been turned upside-down by witchcraft, for causes unknown.
This upside-down household, however, has one merit: it allows the servants Lawrence and Parnell to marry, an occasion that enables the wedding feast, the social event of the year, even after it is disrupted by further witchcraft.
By 3.3, however, witchcraft contamination returns to spoil this hospitality with loss of inhibition, and the wedding party becomes â€˜a medley of mirth, madness, and drunkenness shuffled togetherâ€™ [LW 3.3.
Although the Seelys and their guests make a valiant effort to maintain standards of hospitality with food, drink, and the lodging of the bride and groom, witchcraft frustrates their desires by disrupting the foundational social structures of the neighbourhood: marriage, family relationships, and the communityâ€™s celebration of a positive and potentially procreative occasion.
As at the wedding party, after food and drink comes dancing, and here the playwrightsâ€™ reliance on Edmund Robinson indicates his possible drawing on local gossip for details from Grace Sowerbuttsâ€™ testimony at Samelsbury back in 1612/13 - not the charges of infanticide and cannibalism, but possibly of witchesâ€™ transporting Grace over a river to a sabbat where she danced with â€˜foure black thingsâ€™ with whom, after dancing, she had sexual relations.
In terms of witchcraft fears, the more astonishing dinner-party is Whetstoneâ€™s â€˜short banquetâ€™ [LW 4.5.
Once Generous confronts his wife and renounces her, all the other witches are immediately apprehended, and all those persecuted by witchcraft find their lives in order again.
But this display of witchcraft confounded has not convinced everyone.
This low-key opposition to the overblown display of witchcraft in the comedy is the playâ€™s final note, and it is not unequivocal.
Bantam and Shakestone are sneering young gallants when we first meet them in act 1, deliberately baiting Arthur over witchcraft belief, and baiting Whetstone for being a bastard - a proper pair of sportsmen.
Although the London audience may incline towards Shakestoneâ€™s views (as indeed Tomkyns seems to do), the fun of the play is the spectacle of magic and the teasing comedy of witchcraft, which in this play is by no means as reprehensible as the brutality of the soldier or the ungenerous Generous who finally has a good excuse for abandoning his wife and her embarrassing nephew.
That attitude is in line with the verdict on the Lancashire witch trials of 1634 in London.
The problem of maleficent witchcraft in Lancashire belongs to another world, which Heywood and Brome place as rustic comedy, not meant to be taken seriously by the intelligent and sophisticated.
Applaud]; and suggests the additional meaning that the story the play told was just a fable, not historic fact supporting witchcraft.
The revenge motive was an accepted elite view of witchcraft because it absolved the victims of any wrongdoing that might have invited the witchâ€™s attack.
By implication, the perceived â€˜witchcraftâ€™ attacks are really the self-punishing reprisals of their own consciences.
n9946     This modernized version is taken from the appendix of John Webster, The displaying of supposed witchcraft wherein is affirmed that there are many sorts of deceivers and impostors and divers persons under a passive delusion of melancholy and fancy, but that there is a corporeal league made betwixt the Devil and the witch â€¦ is utterly denied and disproved : wherein also is handled, the existence of angels and spirits, the truth of apparitions, the nature of astral and sydereal spirits, the force of charms, and philters, with other abstruse matters (1677) [Wing / W1230].
Image magic was more an issue of the 1612 cases than of this 1634 case, and doubtless Edmund adds it to his story because he had heard tales of image magic and assumed it was a convincing element in his narrative.
and at Abbington arraigned, condemned, and executed on the 26 day of February last (London, 1579) in Barbara Rosen, ed., Witchcraft in England, 1558-1618 (1969; rpt Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1991), p. 87.
In another case published as The Witches of Northhamptonshire, 1612, Helen Jenkenson, â€˜noted a long time to be of an evil life and much suspected of this crimeâ€™ [bewitching a child to death] was accused by Mistress Moulsho of bewitching her laundry, because when the maid hung the clothes out to dry, they were found,
Jenkenson was executed, despite her plea â€˜that she was guiltlessâ€™.
n9954     Possibly this woman is Jennet Device, the child witness of the 1612 cases.
REVEALED: The testimonies of 10 Pendle witches charged with murder
THE voices of the Pendle witches will come alive and join a diverse line-up of Lancaster Universityâ€™s upcoming Public Lectures.
Charged with the murder of ten people through witchcraft in 1612, the women accused had their testimonies recorded by Thomas Potts, and these will be explored at the lecture.
In 1612, these people were dreadfully misjudged and, even today, some are still quick to judge a book by its cover.
The twelve accused of witchcraft lived around Pendle Hill and were charged with the murders of ten people.
It has been estimated that all of the English witch trials that took place between the 15th and 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions; the Pendle Witch Trials account for more than two per cent of that total.
Tales of witches and warlocks, gruesome murders and terrible crimes await (not suitable for children under ten).
Pendle Hill Witch Hunt, Lancashire, north England
Pendle Hill, which rises up above the Lancashire countryside, an hour north of Manchester, is so haunted that many locals refuse to walk on the hill after dark.
The trials of the Pendle Witches, which took place in 1612, are the most famous witch trials in English history, where ten people were hung for crimes including murder by witchcraft.
Getting there: Pendle Hill is around one hourâ€™s drive north of Manchester, but is difficult to reach via public transport.
18th August 1612: Trial of the Pendle Witches begins
On the 18th August 1612, the trials of nine Lancashire women and two men known as the Pendle Witches began.
Accused of various murders, twelve people were charged of whom was found not guilty and another died in prison before going to trial.
The other ten were found guilty and executed by hanging.
The trials of the Lancashire witches are not only some of the most famous, but also some of the best recorded witch trials in British history.
This is due to a published account called The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster by Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes where all but one of the trials took place.
A number of the accused even admitted to Roger Nowell, the justice of the peace for Pendle and chief prosecutor at the trials, that witchcraft had been practised by a number of people in the area around Pendle Hill for many years.
In historical terms, the Pendle Witch trials were significant for their scale.
Despite a popular belief that witch trials were a common occurrence in the early modern period, only around 500 people were executed for witchcraft throughout the 300 year period when they were carried out.
There will already be loads going on at Halloween but there's quite a few haunted spots in the region and a big party takes place on Pendle Hill.
Alice Nutter was one of the Pendle witches, a group of women tried for murder by witchcraft in 1612.
Strict guidelines have been set about what any sculptor should consider when designing it, including an insistence that the artwork "needs to celebrate a resident who was unfairly treated" and "should represent 1612".
An account of the Pendle witches was published at the time of their trials
The Pendle Trials were some of the most famous witch trials in English history and records show that Alice was perceived as different from the others being judged.
She was wealthier than the rest and barely spoke at her trial, offering no plea or defence against the accusation of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft.
She was found guilty and executed at Lancaster Castle on 20 August, 1612, for having bewitched to death "by devilish practices and hellish means".
18th August 1612
The trial of the Pendle witches begins.
11 tried, 9 convicted and executed.
The trials of the Pendle witches in 1612 are among the most famous witch trials in English history, and some of the best recorded of the 17th century.
The twelve accused lived in the area around Pendle Hill in Lancashire, and were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of witchcraft.
All but two were tried at Lancaster Assizes on 18–19 August 1612, along with the Samlesbury witches and others, in a series of trials that have become known as the Lancashire witch trials.
One was tried at York Assizes on 27 July 1612, and another died in prison.
Of the eleven who went to trial – nine women and two men – ten were found guilty and executed by hanging; one was found not guilty.
The official publication of the proceedings by the clerk to the court, Thomas Potts, in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster, and the number of witches hanged together – nine at Lancaster and one at York – make the trials unusual for England at that time.
It has been estimated that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions; this series of trials accounts for more than two per cent of that total.
Six of the Pendle witches came from one of two families, each at the time headed by a woman in her eighties: Elizabeth Southerns (aka Demdike[a]), her daughter Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren James and Alizon Device; Anne Whittle (aka Chattox), and her daughter Anne Redferne.
The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living by posing as witches.
Witches in the dock: 10 of Britainâ€™s most infamous witch trials
What happened when someone was charged with conversing with the Devil or practising sorcery on the king?
Owen Davies lifts the lid on 10 of Britainâ€™s most infamous witch trials
The prosecution and hanging of two men and eight women on Pendle Hill in Lancashire in 1612 has long caught the public imagination, the story being retold in puppet shows, pamphlets, plays and novels.
In terms of witchcraft as heritage tourism, Pendle Hill has become the Salem of Britain.
A century later, the last conviction for witchcraft in England took place in Hertfordshire.
It is fitting to put both trials in context, and explore the rise and decline of witch persecution in Britain.
This was not an episode of mass insanity: witchcraft made perfect sense within the world view of people at the time.
Itâ€™s also important to remember that, for two centuries after the last person was executed for witchcraft in Scotland in the 1720s, people continued to harbour a genuine fear of witches.
One common misconception is that witch trials belong to the medieval era.
In fact, there were no laws against witchcraft in Britain until 1542, when Henry VIII passed an act against witchcraft and conjuration.
During the 15th century, concern was repeatedly expressed about necromancy and sorcery in aristocratic circles, leading to a handful of trials for treason, heresy, slander and murder.
Commoners such as Jourdemayne were rarely caught up in such intrigues, but the tables would be turned more than a century later when witchcraft was seen to be a pervasive problem.
Henry VIIIâ€™s witchcraft act of 1542 was deemed unfit for purpose, and was repealed in 1547.
Essex was the heartland of the earliest witch trials under the new act, and it was the county that pursued witch prosecutions most vigorously over the next century.
Elizabeth Frauncis confessed that she had been taught witchcraft at the age of 12 by her grandmother.
Frauncis was imprisoned, Agnes Waterhouse was hanged for committing murder by witchcraft, and Joan was found not guilty.
Would you have been accused of witchcraft?
Unlike in England and Wales, torture was legally acceptable in Scottish witchcraft cases.
Jamesâ€™s desire to keep a close eye on the prosecution of witchcraft led him to decree in 1597 that all such trials be conducted by the central judiciary rather than local courts.
The king became more sceptical about witchcraft accusations in later years.
4) 1594: Gwen Ellis is the first witch to be executed in Wales
The witch trials were at their peak in England when, in June 1594, Gwen Ellis, a woman in her early forties who had been married three times, was taken to Flint gaol on suspicion of witchcraft.
Accusations accumulated, the most serious of which was that she murdered one Lewis ap John by witchcraft.
Ellisâ€™s case was one of only 34 or so prosecutions for witchcraft in Wales, a remarkably low number in the annals of European witch trials.
5) 1612: Pendle hangings cause a sensation
The Pendle witches are famous for confessing to having attended a Sabbat (a meeting of witches) at Malkin Tower, Pendle Hill on Good Friday in 1612.
The Pendle saga began in simple fashion when, in March 1612, young Alison Device met a peddler named John Law and asked him for a pin.
Reports of one person denying another charity turn up in numerous witch trials.
This replaced the 1563 act and extended the death penalty to invoking evil spirits and using dead bodies in witchcraft â€“ an echo perhaps of events at North Berwick.
On 20 August 1612 two men and eight women were hanged at the gallows erected on the moors above Lancaster.
Witch trials in England had slowed to a trickle by the time of the Civil War of the 1640s, but during this period of turmoil and strife the â€˜Witchfinder Generalâ€™ Matthew Hopkins and his sidekick John Stearne set about sowing a trail of fear and death across the eastern counties.
Hopkins died two years later, having instigated some 300 trials that led to the execution of some 100 people.

7) 1697: six people are executed on the word of an 11-year-old
While the last documented execution for witchcraft in England took place in1682, three men and four women were sentenced to death in Paisley, Scotland, in 1697 for committing murder by witchcraft.
Six of them were hanged and burned for witchcraft â€“ and one committed suicide before the sentence was carried out.

Blakeney Chapel

Blakeney Point
Blakeney Point (officially called Blakeney National Nature Reserve) is a National Nature Reserve situated near to the villages of Blakeney, Morston and Cley next the Sea on the north coast of Norfolk, England.
Its main feature is a 6.4 km (4 mi) spit of shingle and sand dunes, but the reserve also includes salt marshes, tidal mudflats and reclaimed farmland.
The area has a long history of human occupation; ruins of a medieval monastery and "Blakeney Chapel" (probably a domestic dwelling) are buried in the marshes.
The River Glaven can become blocked by the advancing shingle and cause flooding of Cley village, Cley Marshes nature reserve, and the environmentally important reclaimed grazing pastures, so the river has to be realigned every few decades.
Despite the name, Blakeney Point, like most of the northern part of the marshes in this area, is part of the parish of Cley next the Sea.
[1] The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to Weybourne.
[6] Salt marshes have formed between the shingle curves and in front of the coasts sheltered by the spit,[5] and sand dunes have accumulated at the Point's western end.
[7] There is an area of reclaimed farmland, known as Blakeney Freshes, to the west of Cley Beach Road.
Norfolk Coast Path, an ancient long distance footpath, cuts across the south eastern corner of the reserve along the sea wall between the farmland and the salt marshes, and further west at Holme-next-the-Sea the trail joins Peddars Way.
[8][10] The tip of Blakeney Point can be reached by walking up the shingle spit from the car park at Cley Beach,[2] or by boats from the quay at Morston.
[13] Halfway House, or the Watch House, is a building 2.4 km (1.5 mi) from Cley Beach car park.
An "eye" is an area of higher ground in the marshes, dry enough to support buildings.
Blakeney's former Carmelite friary, founded in 1296 and dissolved in 1538, was built in such a location,[17] and several fragments of plain roof tile and pantiles dating back to the 13th century have been found near the site of its ruins.
[18] Originally on the south side of the Glaven, Blakeney Eye had a ditched enclosure during the 11th and 12th centuries, and a building known as "Blakeney Chapel", which was occupied from the 14th century to around 1600, and again in the late 17th century.
Despite its name, it is unlikely that it had a religious function.
The spit sheltered the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, which were important medieval harbours.
Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, and between the 14th and 16th centuries it was the only Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials.
[15] Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church.
Land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 just to the west of Cley, led to the silting up of the Glaven shipping channel and relocation of Cley's wharf.
[24] Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley.
[25] In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost.
[25] Blakeney's shipping trade benefited from the silting up of its nearby rival, and in 1817 the channel to the Haven was deepened to improve access.
In 1901, the Blakeney and Cley Wild Bird Protection Society created a bird sanctuary and appointed as its "Watcher", Bob Pinchen, the first of only six men, up to 2012, to hold that post.
When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility of development.
[28] In 1912, a public appeal initiated by Charles Rothschild and organised by UCL Professor Francis Wall Oliver and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust.
[29] UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913,[2] where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point.
[30] The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre.
The Point was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1954, along with the adjacent Cley Marshes reserve, and subsumed into the newly created 7,700-hectare (19,000-acre) North Norfolk Coast SSSI in 1986.
Blakeney Point has been designated as one of the most important sites in Europe for nesting terns by the government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
Blakeney is the most important site in Britain for both Sandwich and Little Terns, the roughly 200 pairs of the latter species amounting to eight per cent of the British population.
Seabirds may be sighted passing the Point, and migrating waders feed on the marshes at this time of year.
[27] In the winter, the marshes hold Golden Plovers and wildfowl including Common Shelduck, Eurasian Wigeon, Brent Geese and Common Teal,[8] while Common Scoters, Common Eiders, Common Goldeneyes and Red-breasted Mergansers swim offshore.
Blakeney Point has a mixed colony of about 500 harbour and grey seals.
[13] Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001.
[41] Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals.
[13] The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.
The site of Blakeney Chapel Still marked as such on OS maps, nothing remains of the so-called Blakeney Chapel, located in the corner where the Peddars Way/Norfolk Coast Path makes a sharp turn to the west.
The tidal River Glaven extends from the sluices on the A149 coast road > http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/980634 and from there runs parallel to the coast, through the Glaven estuary behind the sand and shingle spit known as Blakeney Spit, before it discharges into the sea at Blakeney Point.
Flood defence embankments run adjacent to the channel, which prevents the tidal flooding of adjacent fresh water marshes at Blakeney Freshes and at Cley and Salthouse.
Because of the impeding danger of the former channel of the River Glaven being blocked by natural southwards migration of Blakeney Spit, and more recently also because of shingle that had become displaced following storms in 1993 and in 1996, resulting in flooding of the adjacent Blakeney Freshes Special Protection Area and the village of Cley, the Environment Agency decided to cut a new channel to the south of the old one > http://www.geograph.org.uk/submit.php.
Before the cutting of a new channel to realign the course of the River Glaven through the Blakeney Freshes, an archaeological survey was carried out in 2003 - 05 in order to excavate and record what remained of the so-called Blakeney Chapel, an ancient scheduled monument located on a low natural rise within a cattle pasture by Blakeney Spit.
Cartographic evidence suggests that a structure has existed at this site from at least 1586; archaeological investigation indicated human activity in the area since neolithic times but it could not be established what purpose the building served - historical evidence for any religious dedication could be not found.
The walls of the building were partly re-buried but the ground-plan of the structure was left clearly visible for public inspection for as long as the monument would survive - only a few years later no traces remain.
Parish Summary: Cley next the Sea
The parish of Cley next the Sea is located on the north Norfolk coast, roughly halfway between Wells next the Sea and Sheringham.
The easternmost part of Blakeney Point and the Blakeney Freshes marshes are located in the northwest and the world renowned Cley Marshes Nature Reserve occupies much of the northeast.
A reasonable amount of archaeological work has been carried out in Cley next the Sea.
Archaeological investigations (NHER 37793) at Blakeney Eye have revealed Neolithic and Bronze Age pottery, along with a possible Neolithic enclosure, pits and post holes.

An Early Saxon gold bracteate from the site of 'Blakeney Chapel'.
A rare Early Saxon gold bracteate was recovered during excavations at Blakeney Eye (NHER 37793).
Late Saxon pottery has been gathered from Blakeney Eye and part of a stirrup has been found in the south.
Cley next the Sea appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as â€˜Claiaâ€™.
In 1253 Cley was granted a weekly Friday market and a yearly fair.
During the medieval and post medieval period Cley next the Sea was an important port.
The sites of two medieval chapels are marked in the marshes on Fadenâ€™s map of 1797, one on Blakeney Eye and the other on Cley Eye.
â€˜Blakeney Chapelâ€™ (NHER 6245 and 37793) was excavated in 2003 and 2004 when medieval flint walls, a cobbled surface, building material and artefacts were uncovered.
The evidence suggested that the building was unlikely to have been a chapel and that a domestic and/or agricultural use was more likely.
A map from 1586 shows the building and a man with a dog and rabbits and hints that it could have been a warren lodge.
â€˜Cley Chapelâ€™ (NHER 6163) could have been a religious building, although it is also possible that Faden misidentified it.
In the south of the village the remains of a medieval or post medieval building (NHER 6151) were discovered during earthmoving and medieval pits (NHER 1030) were found during a watching brief.
The five storey mill with attached buildings from the southeast.
Cley Mill is a famous local landmark.
During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries the saltmarshes in the north of the parish were reclaimed and drained.
These surrounded the areas now known as Blakeney Freshes and the Cley Marshes Nature Reserve, leaving only a limited amount of saltmarsh alongside the Glaven channel.
In 1612 Cley suffered a devastating fire and 117 buildings were destroyed.
There are numerous post medieval buildings, most of which post date the fire.
17th century buildings include those at Newgate Farm, Manor House, The Gables and The Nest.
Cley Hall, The Customs House, Fairstead House, Flanders, The White House, Well Cottage and Rocket House are amongst the 18th century buildings.
Cley Windmill dates to the 18th or 19th century.
The remains of a World War Two coastal battery on the beach at Cley next the Sea.
At the eastern end of Blakeney Point was a coastal battery (NHER 24184).
It included two gun emplacements, pillboxes (NHER 23194, 32455 and 32462), barbed wire obstructions and a complex of buildings (NHER 27794), with a minefield to the east (NHER 27752).

Norfolk Coast Path between Blakeney and Cley - Latest Developments
The storm surge on 5th/6th December 2013 caused a lot of damage to the area around Cley and Blakeney as evidenced during an earlier walk, detailed at The Aftermath of the 2013 Storm Surge - Blakeney, Cley and Salthouse.
Returning during August 2014, it would appear that repair works are in progress although the long term future of both the Blakeney Freshes and the Coast Path around them is uncertain.
There is also a major breach adjacent to Blakeney Quay where the current footpath diverts onto the beach area in front of Blakeney.
We believe it is inevitable that the habitats of the Blakeney Freshes are going to change over time in response to sea level rise.
We also want to reduce the time that saltwater stands on the marshes and we are looking into improvements to the existing sluices and drainage system.
Follow the A149 road route - The road between Blakeney and Cley has a pavement throughout the distance.
Diversion through Wiveton - Walking from Blakeney, this takes a permissive path along the edge of the marsh to Wiveton Hall before heading up to the road and straight across to follow the quiet lanes into Wiveton.
Altogether this is a most pleasant and rewarding alternative with added features of both Wiveton and Cley churches plus two pubs along the route.
The route heads south out of Cley, and then uses quiet lanes, footpaths and the permissive path across the downs and back down to the Coast Path between Blakeney and Morston.
Full details of this route can be found at Inland Walk between Cley and Blakeney.

There is also speculation that this was the date that the building first became an Inn but the name of the appears to refer back to earlier times.
This is also borne out in the royal crest which is displayed on the southern wall of the building.

On the northward side of the marshes at the point where the Coast Path turns westwards towards Blakeney is the location of the old Blakeney Chapel.
Despite its name, Blakeney Chapel is not in the parish of Blakeney but Cley and even its use as a chapel is rather dubious.
Old maps depict it as a chapel but there is no documentary or archaeological evidence to support the claim of any religious function with the only clue to its use being a small hearth which it has been suggested could imply was for smelting iron.
Its first appearance on a map was in 1586 where the building was depicted but unnamed.
By 1769 a map by Cranefields displayed the buidling as "Eye House" but by 1797 William Faden's map names the building as Chapel ruins, a name which has stuck to the present time.
Little of the structure remains apart from the foundations, the original building material probably carried off for reuse in the buildings of Cley and Blakeney.
Today the ruins are protected as a scheduled monument although there is no active management.

This is also borne out in the royal crest which is displayed on the southern wall of the building.
The large parish contained seven manorial estates, numerous ancient farmsteads, the industrial and trading village of Blakeney which replaced Awre village as the principal centre of population, and the small but commercially significant riverside hamlet of Gatcombe.
8) and in 1953 850 a. of East Dean, including Blakeney Hill woods, Blakeney Hill hamlet, and part of Viney Hill hamlet, were added to Awre parish.
The land is drained principally by Bideford brook, which is formed at Blakeney by the confluence of Soudley (fn.
35) In the late 1840s much work to defend the point, including the rebuilding of the cribs and the addition of new ones, was carried out under the direction of William Clegram of Saul, engineer to the Gloucester and Berkeley canal company.
The main road through the parish, linking Gloucester and Chepstow (Mon.), probably follows for most of its course a Roman road leading from Newnham to Caerleon (Mon.); the names of Stretfield hill, north of Blakeney, and Oldstreet House, near the south boundary of the parish, presumably derive from that ancient road.
51) and a new, curving descent into Blakeney village from the north-east, built during 1830 and 1831 to replace a steeper and more direct descent called Swan Lane.
57) A third route from the Forest, down the west side of the valley of Soudley brook to Blakeney, (fn.
An extensive system of footpaths called church ways or burying roads, which the local court leet jury was vigilant in preserving in the 18th and 19th centuries, linked the many scattered farmsteads to Awre church and Blakeney chapel.
Powers for building the main South Wales railway line through Awre were obtained by an Act of 1846 under which the Gloucester and Dean Forest company was to build the line as far as Hagloe and the South Wales company to continue it southwards.
64) The parish was served by a station at Purton in Lydney, but called Gatcombe station, until 1868 when Awre Junction station was built beside the Awre-Blakeney road at the junction with the new Forest of Dean Central railway.

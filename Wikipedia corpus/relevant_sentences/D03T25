Before relying on any portion of the Act as it appears here, reference should be made to the official report of the Act in the United States Code (15 U.S.C. §§ 1821­1831).
1861 United States Department of Agriculture
1906 "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclaire; showed brutalization and exploitation of workers in a Chicago meat packing warehouse
1966 Laboratory Animal Welfare Act- (Animal Welfare Act 1970), Regulate transport, sale, and handling of dogs, cats, non-human primates, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits
Horse Protection Act: P.L. 91-540 (December 9,1970), as amended, makes it a crime to exhibit, or transport for the purpose of exhibiting, any "sored" horse, which is one whose feet have been injured deliberately to accentuate the animal’s gait.
We are amending the horse protection regulations to require horse industry organizations or associations that license Designated Qualified Persons to assess and enforce minimum penalties for violations of the Horse Protection Act (the Act).
The regulations currently provide that such penalties will be set either by the horse industry organization or association or by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
This action will strengthen our enforcement of the Act by ensuring that minimum penalties are assessed and enforced consistently by all horse industry organizations and associations that are certified under the regulations by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
In 1970, Congress passed the Horse Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1821-1831), referred to below as the Act or the HPA, to eliminate the practice of soring by prohibiting the showing or selling of sored horses.
In the Act, Congress found and declared that the soring of horses is cruel and inhumane.
The practice of soring horses is aimed at producing an exaggerated show gait for competition.
Although a gait similar to “the big lick” can be obtained using selective breeding and humane training methods, soring achieves this accentuated gait with less effort and over a shorter period of time.
Thus, Congress found and declared that horses shown or exhibited which are sore, where such soreness improves the performance of such horse, compete unfairly with horses which are not sore.
Congress further found and declared that the movement, showing, exhibition, or sale of sore horses in intrastate commerce adversely affects and burdens interstate and foreign commerce.
Section 4 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1823) directs the Secretary of Agriculture to prescribe, by regulation, requirements for the appointment by the management of any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction (referred to below as “show management”) of persons qualified to detect and diagnose a horse which is sore or to otherwise inspect horses for the purpose of enforcing the Act.
The intent of Congress and the purpose of this provision is to encourage horse industry self-regulatory activity and to allow show management to have the benefit of certain limits upon their liability under the Act if they employ a Designated Qualified Person (DQP) to detect and diagnose soring and to otherwise inspect horses for the purpose of enforcing the Act.
Paragraph (d) of § 11.21 requires the certified DQP organization (i.e., the HIO) under which the DQP is licensed to assess appropriate penalties for violations, as set forth in the rule book of the certified program under which the DQP is licensed, or as set forth by the USDA.
In addition to the DQP's report to show management, the HIO must also report all violations to show management.
APHIS-2011-0030) a proposal [1] to amend the regulations to require HIOs that license DQPs to assess and enforce minimum penalties for violations of the Act.
The audit found that APHIS' program for inspecting horses for soring is not adequate to ensure that these animals are not being abused.
Due to this ineffective inspection system, the report stated, the Act is not being sufficiently enforced, and the practice of abusing show horses continues.
One of the recommendations in the audit report was that APHIS develop and implement protocols to more consistently negotiate penalties with individuals who are found to be in violation of the Act.
We stated that requiring HIOs to implement a minimum penalty protocol would strengthen our enforcement of the Act by ensuring that minimum penalties are assessed and enforced consistently by all HIOs that are certified under the regulations pursuant to section 4 of the Act.
Many commenters supported the proposed rule and increased enforcement of the Act in general, stating that the horse industry had failed to eliminate soring.
One commenter stated that requiring less stringent penalties has become a way for HIOs to attract business.
These commenters stated that the proposed rule would ensure that soring is properly deterred and punished and that requiring uniform minimum penalties would benefit owners and trainers who reject soring and exhibit sound horses, consistent with the intention of the Act.
Most of the commenters who supported the proposed rule also recommended that we require penalties more stringent than those we had proposed; these comments are discussed below under the heading “Requests for Increases in Proposed Penalties and Addition of Penalties for Other Violations.”
Of the commenters who opposed the proposed rule, several stated that minimum mandatory penalties are not necessary because the current HIO system is working to prevent sore horses from being shown, exhibited, sold, or auctioned.
Commenters cited high compliance rates for horses entered at DQP-inspected shows.
Several commenters stated that the current penalties that HIOs assess and enforce are effective.
Another commenter stated that there is no uncertainty about penalties under the current system, as each HIO has a published penalty structure available to all participants.
Another commenter stated that despite any progress, much work remains to accomplish the goal of eliminating soring, and that the compliance rates cited by other commenters are meaningless for several reasons: (1) The HIOs themselves are reporting the compliance rates; (2) the overall rate includes HIOs committed to the sound, unsored horse along with other HIOs, artificially inflating the compliance rate for the latter; (3) the overall rate does not include horses that are brought to shows, exhibitions, sales, and auctions but not presented for inspection when USDA is present; and (4) the overall rate includes horses that got through inspection by use of drugs.
We have determined that it is necessary to establish minimum penalties to be assessed and enforced by HIOs in this final rule.
As discussed in the proposed rule, the OIG audit found that APHIS' program for inspecting horses for soring, specifically the industry self-regulation carried out by DQPs trained by and operating under HIOs that are certified under the regulations, has not been adequate to ensure that these animals are not being abused.
The OIG audit indicated that over 30 years of industry self-regulation through the DQP program has failed to eliminate the cruel and inhumane practice of soring, thus necessitating APHIS action to make the industry's self-regulatory efforts more effective.
In addition, focusing on compliance rates obscures the fact that substantial numbers of horses are still found to be in violation of the Act each year, meaning that HIO enforcement has not been sufficient to eliminate the cruel and inhumane practice of soring.
One commenter stated that HIO penalties are appropriate and set based on years of experience and the severity of the violation.
This commenter stated that DQPs do a better job of enforcement when a single DQP's inspection results in a smaller penalty, because the penalties that would be enforced would not potentially put a person out of business or shut down a training facility that employs several people.
As documented in the OIG audit, DQPs issue substantially more violations when APHIS VMOs are present than when they are not, suggesting that high compliance rates achieved at shows where only HIO DQPs are present may not reflect a decreased prevalence of soring.
As this differential exists under the current HIO penalty structures, we do not believe that HIOs with less stringent penalties than those we proposed are ensuring the freer issuance of violations.
The OIG audit was based on data from several years, including a review of show reports from the 2008 season and site visits conducted in 2008.
As noted earlier, the conclusions of the audit indicate that over 30 years of industry self-regulation through the DQP program has failed to eliminate the cruel and inhumane practice of soring.
Many commenters stated that the penalties currently assessed by HIOs exceed those in the Act.
(Conversely, two commenters stated that the proposed penalties far exceed those mandated in the Act.)
Regardless of whether the penalties imposed by HIOs exceed those in the Act, the information and data discussed in the proposed rule and directly above indicate that those penalties are not successfully achieving the goal of the DQP and HIO program, which is to end the cruel and inhumane practice of soring.
Requiring all HIOs to assess and enforce minimum penalties for violations of the Act will ensure that all HIOs are operating in a consistent manner and will enhance the effectiveness of the Horse Protection Program.
Several commenters stated that the Department does not have the authority to change or modify the penalties in the Act by establishing a minimum penalty protocol in the regulations.
The Act sets out criminal and civil penalties for violations of the Act in section 6 (15 U.S.C. 1825).
This section gives the Department authority to pursue criminal and civil penalties against those who violate the Act.
The DQP program, in contrast, was established in the regulations pursuant to section 4 of the Act in order to encourage horse industry self-regulatory activity and to allow show management to have the benefit of certain limits upon its liability under the Act.
Over the years, the role of HIOs has expanded to include assessing and enforcing penalties for violations of the Act, in accordance with § 11.21(d) of the regulations.
However, the industry self-regulatory activity, and in particular the penalties HIOs have assessed and enforced under the regulations, have not been sufficient to end the cruel and inhumane practice of soring.
One issue that has made the HIO penalties less effective than they could have been is the discrepancies that have existed among the penalties assessed and enforced by HIOs for certain offenses, resulting in inconsistent enforcement of the Act.
To ensure that the horse industry is effectively working to eliminate the cruel and inhumane practice of soring, in accordance with section 4 of the Act and with the original purpose of the regulations, this final rule requires HIOs to assess and enforce minimum penalties for violations of the Act.
The penalties we are requiring HIOs to assess and enforce in this final rule do not exceed the civil penalties provided in the Act, and this final rule does not change the penalties provided in the Act.
One commenter quoted paragraph (c) of section 4 of the Act, which states that the Secretary shall prescribe by regulation requirements for the appointment by the management of any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction of persons qualified to detect and diagnose a horse which is sore or to otherwise inspect horses for the purposes of enforcing the Act.
Similarly, two other commenters stated that, because the Act prohibits showing or exhibiting, entering for the purpose of showing or exhibiting, or selling, auctioning, or offering for sale any horse that is sore, all that is required under the Act is that a DQP inspect for soring, notify management when a horse is sore, and provide the appropriate reports.
Therefore, these commenters stated, the proposal to require HIOs to assess and enforce minimum penalties is an effort to circumvent the Act.
Some commenters stated that the language of the Act only allows the Secretary to assess and enforce penalties and does not give the Secretary the authority to impose penalties through any other means, including a private organization such as an HIO.
One commenter stated that the provisions of paragraph (b) of section 6 show that any penalty structure that an HIO implements is strictly voluntary, although the HIOs have always felt itwas in the best interest of the Act to have a penalty structure in place to deter soring.
Another commenter stated that the HIOs that currently assess and enforce penalties do so through the power given to them by the exhibitors, and that the Department cannot mandate penalties to be enforced by a private corporation.
As discussed earlier, the Act itself does not prescribe the creation of HIOs; the Department decided to create them as DQP licensing authorities to further industry self-regulation towards the goal of eliminating the cruel and inhumane practice of soring.
The regulations in § 11.21(d) have long indicated that HIOs shall assess appropriate penalties for violators, as set forth in their rulebooks or as set forth by the Department.
This final rule sets forth those penalties that we have determined to be appropriate and necessary to eliminate soring, which the HIOs have failed to do.
HIOs that do not wish to cooperate in the effort to eliminate soring by imposing the minimum penalties required in this final rule may withdraw from certification; if an HIO refuses to implement the minimum penalties, we will initiate proceedings to decertify the HIO, as described in § 11.7(g).
Several commenters stated that requiring HIOs to assess and enforce penalties would be inconsistent with the Act's requirement, in paragraph (b) of section 6, that no civil penalty will be assessed unless such person is given notice and opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to such violation.
One of these commenters additionally stated that the Department would likely be held liable for the actions of HIOs in the imposition of such penalties and any corresponding deprivation of rights of the individuals affected.
One commenter expressed concern that people who show in front of multiple HIOs during the course of a show season would be required to submit to each HIO's appeal process without being able to appeal the decisions to the Secretary or a court of law.
Thus, the horse industry in general and HIOs specifically have been playing a role in enforcing the HPA since its inception.
Over the years, the role of HIOs has expanded to include assessing and enforcing penalties for violations of the Act.
However, we maintained the authority to intervene if the DQPs and the HIOs that licensed the DQPs were not effectively working towards the goal of eliminating the cruel and inhumane practice of soring.
This final rule responds to problems associated with discrepancies among HIO penalties by requiring consistent penalties, thus enhancing the effectiveness of the industry's self-regulating efforts.
This will ensure that persons who have penalties assessed by an HIO will have recourse to challenge the penalty within the HIO structure, and thus fulfills the due process requirements of the Act.
As currently occurs when HIOs assess and enforce penalties, persons who do not agree with the HIO's decision will be free to bring a suit against the HIO itself.
We do not expect any of these processes or functions to change with the promulgation of minimum required penalties; we are simply specifying penalties in accordance with § 11.21(d).
DQPs find violations of the Act by inspecting horses, and thus penalties will be assessed and enforced on the basis of the results of these inspections.
Under § 11.3, the anterior and anterior-lateral surfaces of a horse's pasterns (extensor surface) must be free of bilateral granulomas, other bilateral pathological evidence of inflammation, and other bilateral evidence of abuse indicative of soring; the posterior surfaces of the pasterns (flexor surface), including the sulcus or “pocket,” may show bilateral areas of uniformly thickened epithelial tissue if such areas are free of proliferating granuloma tissue, irritation, moisture, edema, or other evidence of inflammation.
In order to ensure that the Act is being properly enforced, APHIS sometimes sends veterinary medical officers (VMOs) to conduct inspections of horses at horse shows, exhibitions, sales, and auctions, whether or not the show, exhibition, sale, or auction is affiliated with an HIO.
In addition, where available, VMOs use thermography to assess whether areas in a horse's forelimbs may be inflamed in a manner characteristic of soring, or x-ray examination to determine whether a horse's bones show signs of stress indicative of soring.
Several commenters opposed the imposition of penalties for what they stated are violations based on subjective inspections, which are often the subject of differences of opinion among VMOs, DQPs, and other parties.
These extend to differences of opinion regarding one horse participating in different classes at a horse show.
Several added that the evidence from such inspections would be insufficient to obtain convictions in a court of law, which is why, the commenters stated, the USDA has proposed the minimum penalties to be assessed and enforced by HIOs.
Numerous commenters stated that mandatory penalties should not be imposed until an objective scientific determination of when a horse is sore can be made.
Another commenter stated that a horse that has been trained in order to develop the natural abilities of the horse, without soring, would not be borderline with respect to compliance with the Act and would thus not be diagnosed differently by different VMOs and DQPs.
This commenter stated that the more common problem with respect to subjectivity of digital palpation is DQPs not applying enough pressure during palpation and thus allowing sore horses to be shown, exhibited, sold, or auctioned.
Many commenters expressed concern that requiring HIOs to assess and enforce minimum penalties would encourage owners and trainers to show their horses at shows whose management does not appoint a DQP to perform inspections to ensure that sore horses are not shown.
As noted earlier, at such shows, show management assumes liability under the Act for any sore horses that are shown, exhibited, sold, or auctioned.
These shows are often referred to as “unaffiliated” shows because the show is not affiliated with an HIO that provides a DQP to conduct inspections.
Many of these commenters stated that increasing numbers of horses were being shown at unaffiliated shows, and the proposed rule would accelerate this trend.
One commenter stated that there are currently a minimum of 400 unaffiliated shows each season.
Some of these commenters stated that horses shown at unaffiliated shows would not pass the inspections conducted at HIO-affiliated shows.
One commenter stated that individuals who have been suspended under the current HIO penalties have shown at unaffiliated shows.
All of these commenters stated that APHIS should emphasize enforcement of the Act at unaffiliated shows, and most stated that inspections at unaffiliated shows should be emphasized in place of finalizing the proposed minimum penalty protocol.
Many commenters stated that APHIS inspections at unaffiliated shows have been minimal or nonexistent.
One commenter stated that the Department has never pursued a case against the management of an unaffiliated show.
One commenter stated that the penalty protocol should be implemented along with an increased emphasis on enforcement at unaffiliated shows, to best effectuate the purpose of the Act.
We plan to continue inspections of nonaffiliated shows; at the same time, we are promulgating the minimum penalty protocol in this final rule.
Contrary to the suggestions of many commenters, we do regularly attend unaffiliated shows.
Through October 11, 2011, we attended 12 unaffiliated shows, out of a total of 74 shows attended to that point in that year.
During the 2010 season, we attended 6 unaffiliated shows out of a total of 59 shows attended.
Lists of all shows we have attended in the last 5 years, including unaffiliated shows, are available on the Horse Protection Web site.
[4] When evidence warrants, we investigate unaffiliated shows to determine whether prosecution under the Act is warranted.
We are planning more of these enforcement activities in the future, as attending unaffiliated shows is essential to the effective enforcement of the Act.
It is also essential that we attend shows that are affiliated with HIOs in order to ensure that the DQPs at thoseshows are effectively enforcing the Act.
Over 700 shows in the 2011 season were affiliated with an HIO.
As mentioned earlier, the OIG audit found the current program is not sufficient to prevent soring, and the audit found in particular that DQPs issue substantially more violations when APHIS VMOs are present than when they are not.
For violations for which we proposed to require suspensions in § 11.25(c), we proposed in paragraph (b)(1) to require the suspension of individuals including, but not limited to, the owner, manager, trainer, rider, custodian, or seller, as applicable, who are responsible for showing the horse, exhibiting the horse, entering or allowing the entry of the horse in a show or exhibition, selling the horse, auctioning the horse, or offering the horse for sale or auction.
This commenter recommended that we adopt language from the 2007-2009 HPA Operating Plan, [5] which contained language specifying which individuals should be subject to penalties for various offenses.
Section 5 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1824) prohibits transporting, showing or exhibiting, entering for the purpose of showing or exhibiting, or selling, auctioning, or offering for sale any horse which is sore.
It also prohibits an owner from allowing the showing or exhibiting, entering for the purpose of showing or exhibiting, or selling, auctioning, or offering for sale any horse which is sore.
In addition, as trainers commonly are responsible for showing or exhibiting horses under their care, it is appropriate to require that they be suspended if they fill those roles.
The regulatory text we proposed in paragraph (b)(1) indicated that anyone who is responsible for showing a sore horse, exhibiting such a horse, entering or allowing the entry of such a horse in a show or exhibition, selling such a horse, auctioning such a horse, or offering such a horse for sale or auction must be suspended.
In this final rule, we have rewritten paragraph (b)(1) to read as follows: “For the violations listed in paragraph (c) of this section that require a suspension, any individuals who are responsible for showing the horse, exhibiting the horse, entering or allowing the entry of the horse in a show or exhibition, selling the horse, auctioning the horse, or offering the horse for sale or auction must be suspended.
This may include, but may not be limited to, the manager, trainer, rider, custodian, or seller, as applicable.
We understand that trainers often have multiple horses showing at any given time.
However, if a trainer shows or exhibits multiple horses, or enters multiple horses for the purpose of showing or exhibiting, and a violation of the Act or the regulations is detected on any of those horses, the trainer should be suspended for at least the minimum period prescribed in § 11.25 for each violation.
As discussed earlier, the trainer of a horse that is inspected and found to be sore or otherwise in violation of the Act will be suspended when he or she shows or exhibits that horse or has entered that horse for the purposes of showing or exhibiting it.
The HIOs are responsible for correctly identifying the person who has shown, exhibited, or entered a horse when the HIOs enforce penalties.
In paragraph (b)(2), we proposed to provide that, if a horse is found to be bilaterally sore or unilaterally sore, in violation of the scar rule, or in violation of the prohibition against the use of foreign substances, the transporter of the horse may also be suspended if the transporter had reason to believe that the horse was to be shown, exhibited, entered for those purposes, sold, auctioned, or offered for sale.
Two commenters expressed concern that persons transporting horses would not know whether a horse they were transporting was sore or had a scar, and that those persons should not be subject to penalties.
Section 5 of the Act prohibits the shipping, transporting, moving, delivering, or receiving of any horse which is sore with reason to believe that such horse while it is sore may be shown, exhibited, entered for the purpose of being shown or exhibited, sold, auctioned, or offered for sale, in any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction.
The Act only makes an exception for shipping, transporting, moving, delivering, or receiving of any horse by a common orcontract carrier or an employee thereof in the usual course of the carrier's business or employee's employment unless the carrier or employee has reason to believe that such horse is sore.
Normally, a person will receive a penalty for transporting a sore horse if that person is also responsible for showing the horse, exhibiting the horse, entering or allowing the entry of the horse in a show or exhibition, selling the horse, auctioning the horse, or offering the horse for sale or auction.
If a horse is found to be sore during preshow inspection and the horse is obviously lame or has open lesions, we would consider the transporter to have had reason to believe that the horse is sore and require the HIO to assess and enforce a penalty, even if the transporter was not responsible for one of the activities listed previously.
Proposed paragraph (b)(3) stated that a person who is suspended must not be permitted to show or exhibit any horse or judge or manage any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction for the duration of the suspension.
A person who has been suspended or disqualified as a result of an HPA violation shall not: (1) Enter a horse for the purposes of showing, exhibiting or selling at auction (“Enter a horse,” as used in this section, shall mean to perform any of the activities that are required to be completed before a horse can actually be shown or exhibited); (2) show or exhibit a horse at a horse show, public auction, or exhibition such as a college football game or parade; (3) judge a horse show; (4) enter the show ring during the course of a horse show; (5) enter the inspection area or warm-up area where previously inspected horses are allowed to await ring or sale entry, during the course of a horse show or sale; (6) coach any trainer, owner, or exhibitor anytime during the show or exhibit; (7) transport horses to shows, exhibitions or public auctions; (8) prepare a horse on the sale, show, auction or exhibition grounds; or (9) serve as a horse show official.
Another commenter stated that proposed paragraph (b)(3) should be changed to clearly prohibit anyone who has been suspended from participating at a horse show in any way other than as a spectator.
The activities described in the 2007-2009 Operating Plan are all included within the prohibition from showing or exhibiting any horse or judging or managing any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction.
The 2010 Points of Emphasis states that “a violator on disqualification or suspension may only participate as a spectator at the horse show, horse exhibition, horse sale, or horse auction.”
Paragraph (c) of proposed § 11.25 set out our proposed minimum penalties for each type of violation.
We received several comments on the proposed penalties.
A few commenters stated that the only penalty that should be assessed when a horse is found to be in violation of the Act is that the horse should not be allowed to participate in the horse show, exhibition, sale, or auction at which it was inspected.
These commenters stated that owners of horses would not continue to engage trainers whose horses were not allowed to participate after inspection, as bringing a horse to a show at which it was not then shown was costly.
Section 4 of the Act states that the management of any horse show or horse exhibition shall disqualify any horse from being shown or exhibited which is sore or if the management has been notified by a DQP that the horse is sore.
Thus, such a penalty is the absolute minimum necessary for shows and exhibitions to comply with the Act.
All of the proposed minimum penalties include dismissal of the horse from the horse show, exhibition, sale, or auction at which it was presented for inspection, not just the class for which the inspection was conducted, to provide a further deterrent effect.
(The only exception is for a fractious or unruly horse that cannot be inspected; such a horse has not been found to be in violation of the Act and may be reinspected for another class in the same horse show, exhibition, sale, or auction.)
However, we have found that the minimal self-regulatory effort of simply dismissing the horse from the horse show, exhibition, sale, or auction has not provided sufficient incentive for individuals to eliminate the cruel and inhumane practice of soring horses.
Therefore, we are requiring that HIOs assess and enforce minimum penalties for violations of the Act, to ensure consistent enforcement of the Act.
Some commenters asked that we add fines to the suspension penalties.
Some commenters asked that we increase the suspension penalties as well, to provide a more substantial deterrent, and apply a minimum suspension penalty for all violations, rather than varying the penalties based on the type of violation.
Some commenters addressed each violation listed in proposed paragraph (c) specifically and asked that the penalties be increased.
For horses that are found to be sore, we proposed to require the shortest suspension penalties for scar rule violations, with increased suspensions for unilateral sore violations and the longest suspensions for bilateral sore violations.
A few commenters statedthat both unilaterally sored and bilaterally sored horses are considered “sore” for the purposes of the Act and thus equal penalties should be assessed and enforced in both situations.
One commenter stated that unilateral sore violations are common to balance out the motion of the horse, and recommended that we add penalties for unilateral scarring as well.
Another commenter noted that violations of the scar rule involve evidence of bilateral soring, and recommended that penalties for scar rule violations be set equal to those of a unilaterally sored horse.
We proposed to provide penalties that increase with each violation for bilateral sore, unilateral sore, and scar rule violations, but not for the violations of the equipment-related prohibitions in § 11.2.
One commenter requested that we establish penalties that increase with each violation for such violations.
In addition, we did not propose to require HIOs to assess and enforce suspension penalties when violations of § 11.2 are discovered before or during the show, exhibition, sale, or auction; several commenters requested that we require penalties for such violations.
Some commenters requested that we add required minimum penalties for violations other than those we included in the proposed rule.
Some commenters stated that separate minimum penalties should be established for pressure shoeing, in which the sole of the horse's foot is made sensitive so that standing and walking cause the horse to be in constant pain.
Some commenters stated that minimum penalties should be established for providing false information, for stewarding horses (i.e., inflicting pain to distract the horse during DQP or VMO inspection), and swapping horses (i.e., substituting a horse that has not passed inspection for one that has).
Some commenters stated that the use of plastic wrap (a common means to apply prohibited substances to the horse's forelimbs) or overweight chains on show grounds should be subject to minimum penalties.
We recognize these commenters' desire to ensure that the minimum penalties established in § 11.25 are adequate to prevent soring and address possible violations of the Act comprehensively.
In developing the minimum penalty protocol, APHIS took into account the civil and criminal penalties set forth in the Act; those penalty structures used in previous years, including those penalties included in previous Operating Plans; and input we received from industry stakeholders.
The penalties we proposed are consistent with penalties that have historically been required by the industry in its self-regulating capacity, dating back to 2001.
Our proposal was intended to reflect this historical understanding of penalties that are appropriate for violations of the Act and require the HIOs to assess and enforce consistent penalties while minimizing disruption to the industry.
For those reasons, we have decided to implement the minimum penalties as proposed.
In coming show seasons, we will monitor the effectiveness of each specific penalty at deterring the violation for which the penalty is assessed and enforced.
If any of the penalties does not have the appropriate deterrent effect, or if we determine that there should be minimum penalties for other types of violations, we may propose changes in the future along the lines that these commenters suggest.
Some commenters also asked us to require permanent prohibition of horses found to be in violation of the Act from participating in horse shows, exhibitions, sales, or auctions.
The Act does not provide APHIS with the authority to permanently disqualify horses that have been scarred from soring from competitions, nor does APHIS have the authority to permanently disqualify repeat violators of the Act.
We would not consider it appropriate to require HIOs to enforce penalties exceeding those in the Act.
One commenter recommended that the parties involved in any and all soring violations be fully and immediately publicly disclosed.
One commenter supported penalties for DQPs who ignore violations.
A few commenters expressed concern about APHIS' characterization of the penalties included in proposed paragraph (c) as minimum penalties.
These commenters stated that the phrase “minimum penalties” implies an open door for more penalties to come later.
One commenter asked what prevents us from requiring maximum penalties or from taking a horse away from an individual who has a penalty assessed for a minor infraction.
The word “minimum” in the description of the penalties in § 11.25 refers to the fact that HIOs are free to require penalties in excess of the penalties provided in this final rule.
As discussed earlier, the penalties we proposed are consistent with penalties that have historically been assessed and enforced by the HIOs for the violations listed in paragraph (c) of proposed § 11.25.
The penalties for bilateral soring, unilateral soring, and violations of the scar rule in proposed paragraph (c) each included more severe penalties for repeat offenders, with the third and subsequent violations of these prohibitions earning the longest suspensions.
Two requested that there be no increase in penalties when a person commits a repeat violation (although one made an exception for a habitual offender).
Two commenters supported taking into account all violations in a violator's history when assessing penalties.
The penalties in this final rule increase in severity for repeat offenders to provide an additional deterrent effect for people who have already shown a willingness to violate the Act.
Increasing penalties when a person repeatedly violates established requirements is a common practice to ensure compliance.
One commenter objected to the notion that scar rule penalties should escalate with additional violations only if those violations are found on the same horse.
This commenter stated that showing horses that are scarred is as significant a violation as showing horses that are bilaterally sore, and that it undermines the effectiveness of the scar rule if a violator is allowed to serially scar multiple horses without suffering increasing penalties.
The proposal did not state that penalties would escalate with additional violations only if those violations are found on the same horse.
We proposed to require HIOs to assess and enforce penalties for unilateral sore violations in paragraph (c)(2) of the proposal.
One commenter stated that the penalty for unilateral soring makes no sense because a person would not sore a horse on only one foot.
Two commenters stated that a horse trainer who is soring a horse is not doing so only on one foot, and therefore a unilateral soring violation is more likely caused by the inspection process.
Therefore, a unilateral sore violation may well be evidence of bilateral soring.
As horses that are unilaterally sore are considered to be sore under the Act, it is appropriate to provide minimum penalties that must be assessed and enforced by HIOs when such violations are found.
We proposed to require HIOs to assess and enforce penalties for scar rule violations in paragraph (c)(3) of the proposal.
The proposed penalties were suspensions of 2 weeks for the first offense, 60 days for the second offense, and 1 year for the third offense.
The commenter also opposed requiring penalties for unilateral sore violations, stating that such violations are subject to human factors as well as the reaction of the horse to any surrounding stimuli.
However, as both horses determined to be in violation of the scar rule and horses that are unilaterally sore are considered sore for the purposes of the Act, it is appropriate to require that HIOs assess and enforce penalties when these violations are discovered.
The commenter stated that it is at best unclear what penalties APHIS expects HIOs to assess and enforce when open lesions are found on a horse.
Open lesions fall within the scope of the Act only when they are indicative of soring.
If a horse has open lesions and is also bilaterally or unilaterally sore, the appropriate penalties will apply; if a horse has bilateral open lesions that cause it to be considered sore under the scar rule, it will be penalized as a scar rule violation.
As many HIOs have separate penalties for horses with open lesions, though, we should note that this final rule does not prevent HIOs from continuing to assess and enforce such penalties.
We proposed to require HIOs to assess and enforce penalties for violations of the equipment-related prohibitions in § 11.2(b)(1) through (b)(10) and (b)(12) through (b)(17) in paragraph (c)(5) of the proposal.
The prohibitions in those paragraphs prevent the use of equipment that has been shown to be used to sore horses.
Therefore, we consider it appropriate and necessary to require that penalties be assessed and enforced for such violations.
One commenter expressed concern that a fractious horse could result in a violation for which people could be banned for the rest of the show season.
Such a horse could be entered into and inspected for other classes in the same horse show, exhibition, sale, or auction.
Proposed paragraph (d) of § 11.25 set out a requirement for an appeals process for penalties assessed by an HIO.
One commenter stated that procedural delays often result in suspensions taking effect during the “off” season when horse shows are not held, which has no negative impact at all on the violators.
This commenter suggested that we require HIOs to administer suspensions quickly after a violation has been found in order to further increase the deterrent effect of suspensions, and to require that the suspensions be served during the show season.
Another commenter concurred with the recommendation that suspensions be served during the show season, and proposed defining the show season to exclude the months of December, January, and February.
The requirements in paragraph (d) ensure that, absent an appeal, all penalties will be enforced within 60 days after the violation, which we believe is a reasonable amount of time to allow an appeal to take place if necessary.
After considering requiring suspensions to be served during the show season, we have determined that it would be difficult to track penalties across the different HIOs to ensure both that HIOs are adhering to the 60-day requirement in enforcing their suspensions and that some or all of the suspensions do not occur during the show season.
In addition, the show season may vary among HIOs.
However, we will monitor the HIOs' implementation of the minimum penalty protocol, and if we find that HIOs are attempting to game the system to ensure that a disproportionate number of suspensions are served outside the regular show season, we will change the regulations in order to ensure that the suspension penalties have a stronger deterrent effect.
Paragraph (e) of proposed § 11.25 stated that the Department would retain the authority to initiate enforcement proceedings with respect to any violation of the Act, including violations for which penalties are assessed in accordance with proposed § 11.25, and to impose the penalties authorized by the Act if the Department determines that such actions are necessary to fulfill the purpose of the Act and the regulations.
Penalties imposed by HIOs are not criminal penalties, and thus double jeopardy is not relevant to such penalties.
The analysis concluded that, since the HIOs already administer their own individual penalty protocol for violations of the Act, the proposed rule is not expected to impose additional costs upon HIOs or show participants (other than those individuals who incur more severe penalties because of the rule).
One commenter believed that requiring minimum penalties would force him to close his horse business, and that many others would do the same.
Several commenters noted that many walking horse shows benefit some kind of charity.
These commenters predicted that the proposed rule would lead to charities receiving fewer revenues from such shows due to a lack of participation.
One commenter cited a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, “Horse Welfare: Action Needed to Address Unintended Consequences from Cessation of Domestic Slaughter,” [7] that included an econometric model used to determine what portion of declining horse sale prices may have been due to bans on horse slaughter within the United States.
Another commenter stated that the Tennessee Walking Horse industry has declined more than the horse industry in general, due to factors related to the desires of many in the industry to continue soring horses and the desires of others not to be associated with such activities.
We do not believe that minimum penalties for violations of the Act will necessarily have the effect described by these commenters.
While it is possible that increased penalties for violations of the Act could lead to reduced attendance at shows and exhibitions, this is not the only possible outcome.
The minimum penalties could also lead owners and trainers of walking horses, racking horses, and other gaited horses to use training methods that do not involve soring.
This would allow for continued attendance at all shows, including those benefitting charities.
One commenter stated that his HIO had previously implemented the proposed penalties voluntarily.
As a result, the commenter stated, exhibitors who had shown with the HIO the previous year advised the HIO that, due to the subjectivity of the inspection process and the possibility of receiving an undeserved violation, they could not show with the HIO now.
The commenter stated that implementation of these penalties has already harmed his organization on a small level and expressed concern about the effects on the whole industry of mandating the penalties in the proposed rule.
This final rule will put all HIOs in an equivalent competitive position with respect to penalties, thus removing the incentive for exhibitors to leave organizations such as the commenter's for another HIO on the basis of the penalties assessed by that HIO (unless an HIO decides to impose penalties greater than those required in § 11.25).
In the Act, however, Congress does find that horses shown or exhibited which are sore, where such soreness improves the performance of such horse, compete unfairly with horses which are not sore.
Requiring mandatory minimum penalties for violations of the Act will ensure consistency among HIOs and further the purpose of the Act, which is to eliminate the cruel and inhumane practice of soring.
Efforts to eliminate soring have been hindered by the non-uniform assessment of penalties for violations of the Act.
Since the HIOs already administer a penalty protocol for violations of the Act, the proposed rule is not expected to impose additional costs upon HIOs or show participants (other than those individuals who incur penalties for violating the Act or the regulations).
Reducing uncertainty about penalties for infractions of the Act;
Providing for more fair competition at shows, which may positively impact attendance and regional economies; and
The Small Business Administration's (SBA) small-entity standard for business associations that promote horses through the showing, exhibiting, sale, auction, registry, or any activity which contributes to the advancement of the horse is not more than $7 million in annual receipts (North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 813910).
(d) The HIO that licensed the DQP shall assess and enforce penalties for violations in accordance with § 11.25 and shall report all violations in accordance with § 11.20(b)(4).
§ 11.25 Minimum penalties to be assessed and enforced by HIOs that license DQPs.
Each HIO that licenses DQPs in accordance with § 11.7 must include in its rulebook, and enforce, penalties for the violations listed in this section that equal or exceed the penalties listed in paragraph (c) of this section and must also enforce the requirement in paragraph (d) of this section.
(1) For the violations listed in paragraph (c) of this section that require a suspension, any individuals who are responsible for showing the horse, exhibiting the horse, entering or allowing the entry of the horse in a show or exhibition, selling the horse, auctioning the horse, or offering the horse for sale or auction must be suspended.
This may include, but may not be limited to, the manager, trainer, rider, custodian, or seller, as applicable.
(2) Any person who is responsible for the shipping, moving, delivering, or receiving of any horse that is found to be bilaterally sore or unilaterally sore as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, in violation of the scar rule in § 11.3, or in violation of the prohibition against the use of foreign substances in § 11.2(c), with reason to believe that such horse was to be shown, exhibited, entered for the purpose of being shown or exhibited, sold, auctioned, or offered for sale in any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction, must be suspended; Provided, that this requirement does not apply if the horse was transported by a common or contract carrier or an employee thereof in the usual course of the carrier's business or the employee's employment, unless the carrier or employee had reason to believe that the horse was sore.
(3) A person who is suspended must not be permitted to show or exhibit any horse or judge or manage any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction for the duration of the suspension.
(c) Minimum penalties—(1) Bilateral sore.

The HIO must provide a process in its rulebook for alleged violators to appeal penalties.
The Department retains the authority to initiate enforcement proceedings with respect to any violation of the Act, including violations for which penalties are assessed in accordance with this section, and to impose the penalties authorized by the Act if the Department determines that such actions are necessary to fulfill the purpose of the Act and this part.
In addition, the Department reserves the right to inform the Attorney General of any violation of the Act or of this part, including violations for which penalties are assessed in accordance with this section.

The Operating Plan, which is no longer in effect, was a document in which the Department agreed to allow HIOs to exercise initial enforcement authority, including assessing suspension penalties for certain violations, for horse shows, horse exhibitions, and horse sales and auctions that were affiliated with the HIOs.
The Strategic Plan was designed to increase public-private cooperation in eliminating soring.
Further USDA crackdown on soring practices expected
On April 26, 2011, a federal grand jury in Chattanooga, Tenn., returned a 34-count indictment against Paul Blackburn, 36, and Christen Altman, 25, of Shelbyville, Tenn., as well as Barney Davis, 38, and Jeffery Bradford, 33, of Lewisburg, Tenn., charging them with violations of the federal Horse Protection Act and related financial crimes.
This included inserting metal bolts in the horses' hooves and injecting chemicals into and applying irritants to sensitive areas of the horses' feet and pasterns to exaggerate their high-stepping gait during horse shows.
They went so far as to falsify entry forms and other related paperwork to avoid detection by Department of Agriculture inspectors and designated qualified persons—inspectors certified by the USDA to check horses competing in shows for evidence of soring.
He was sentenced to 12 months' probation and a $1,000 fine Jan. 23 by US District Judge Harry S. Mattice for violating the HPA, among other charges.
As part of Blackburn's probation, Judge Mattice ordered him to write an article describing soring methods used in the gaited-horse community, the effects soring has on the horses, and the scope of soring in the industry.
In 2011, USDA inspectors and designated qualified persons identified 1,111 similar violations of the HPA.
They made it to 474 of the 600 to 700 gaited-horse shows held that year.
The cases marked one of the first criminal indictments brought against individuals for violating the HPA in 20 years.
"The crime committed by (Blackburn) is an example of a wide-spread problem in the equine industry that gives unfair and illegal advantage to some competitors over others, in addition to causing cruelty to the animals," said Bill Killian, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee, in a Jan. 23 DOJ press release.
Congress enacted the Horse Protection Act in 1970, making it a federal offense to show, sell, auction, exhibit, or transport a sored horse.
An expert in natural hoof care, he estimates about a third of his caseload is composed of gaited horses and says that, where he lives, soring is rampant.
An owner-trained horse competing in a local "fun" show is just as likely to have been sored as a professionally trained horse competing in a large show, Dr. Valk said, although the method of soring might be different.
Techniques vary depending on the experience of the applicator and the likelihood of detection, which hinges on the scrutiny and judgment of the person inspecting the horse at a show or sale.
In general, the more simple, less technologically advanced techniques are used with horses competing in small, low-profile shows.
"Unfortunately, the need to avoid detection has fueled the development of newer, more innovative, and more subtle methods of soring," Dr. Valk said.
The same goes for hiding evidence of soring.
Dr. Valk said soring is difficult to stop, because it has become a fixture in the gaited-horse culture.
Horses that move with the extreme, deep gait that is so desirable within the industry win, and soring is the simplest way to create this artificially.
Many trainers and owners believe, therefore, that they must sore their horses to effectively compete in the show ring.
Interestingly, Dr. Valk said the move away from chemical soring toward mechanical soring—in an attempt to avoid detection—has increased the prevalence and severity of hoof lesions and hind limb issues.
Most of his clients in the industry don't view soring as abusive, because it usually doesn't result in visible or permanent damage to the horse—that is to say, they believe that even though the process causes pain (the intended purpose), it does not actually "hurt" the horse.
FAQs about soring
Q: Where are most incidents of soring discovered?
A: Most are found at gaited-horse shows, primarily in the Southern states, including North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Tennessee, and Virginia.
Less often, evidence of soring is seen at shows as far away as California, Washington, and Iowa.
Q: When does the gaited-horse show season take place?
No particular show starts the season, but three of the biggest shows in the Tennessee Walking Horse world are the National Trainers Show, this year from April 12-14, White Pine, Tenn.; Spring Fun Show, May 24-26, Shelbyville Tenn.; and National Celebration, Aug. 22-Sept.
and a backgrounder on soring.
They are available at www.avma.org/soring.
The Animal Care program, which is part of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, enforces the Horse Protection Act and works to eliminate soring.
Dr. Rachel Cezar, Horse Protection Program coordinator with APHIS Animal Care, believes that soring is still common at sanctioned horse shows.
And those are the shows the department knows about.
"Many individuals are just having shows and not telling us," she said.
The appropriation for HPA enforcement was set at $500,000 with the passage of a 1976 amendment to the act, and—until FY 2012—had not been increased again in nearly four decades.
The issue of soring has received more attention in recent years, after the USDA Office of the Inspector General completed an audit in fall 2010 analyzing APHIS' oversight of the Horse Protection Program and the Slaughter Horse Transport Program (see JAVMA, Jan. 15, 2011).
According to the audit's executive summary, the OIG found that APHIS' program for inspecting horses for soring is not adequate to ensure that these animals are not being abused.
As a result, Animal Care's appropriation for HPA enforcement in the FY 2012 agricultural appropriations bill was upped to $696,000 at the request of the Obama administration and a bipartisan group of more than 150 members of Congress.
Dr. Cezar said there's nothing in the HPA addressing the potential conflicts of interest these DQPs might have when performing inspections at shows.
"We're not able to attend all these shows with our funding right now, so we negotiated with the OIG auditors to (have the USDA) take over the training and licensing of the inspectors.
"We are working with the 12 different horse industry organizations to have more consistency with their enforcement of the HPA penalties," Dr. Cezar said.
"It has been difficult to eliminate soring, because there has not been one consistent voice for the industry to self-regulate.
Other areas the USDA may look into are all-out prohibitions on certain soring practices.
APHIS' expectation—in proposing new regulations to establish a consistent penalty protocol for the horse industry organizations to enforce, along with other forthcoming proposals—is to enable the Horse Protection Program to eliminate soring.
If these regulatory changes and the resulting changes in the program do not eliminate soring, however, the USDA will "seriously consider taking substantially more restrictive action, including, but not limited to, prohibiting the use of all action devices and pads, to accomplish the goal set forth by Congress in the Act," according to comments by the agency in a 2010 proposed rule.
As the USDA APHIS moves to improve its enforcement of the HPA, the agency has received help from the USDA Office of the Inspector General and the Department of Justice to stop soring through another tactic—taking HPA offenders to court.
Certified DQPs or USDA inspectors can issue only civil penalties for violations they find.
The maximum penalty, according to the HPA, is a one-year disqualification and a $3,000 fine.
The USDA OIG has the authority to pursue criminal violations of the HPA, including allegations related to soring and false entries or statements.
The government scored a legal victory with the guilty pleas and convictions of Blackburn, Davis, Bradford, and Altman on abuses related to soring.
"In the past, we haven't had much support to look at doing these types of penalties, but, fortunately, we have received more support from the OIG wanting to enforce the HPA," Dr. Cezar said.
"They're interested in helping us, because they realized how soring is an inhumane and abusive practice that is still occurring and needs to be eliminated."
Zahnd pleaded guilty to charges that at a July 4, 2009, show in Tennessee, a horse he had trained and stabled was wearing a nerve cord in its mouth and was bilaterally "sore," as determined by an inspector.
Nerve cords are plastic zip ties applied around a horse's gums to distract the horse during an inspection for soring.
Zahnd was already a five-time HPA violator, according to the HPA database.
There have been too many people who have acted with impunity in this arena for too long by violating the Horse Protection Act and other federal laws.
Hopefully, the possibility of being federally prosecuted, sustaining criminal convictions—felonies and misdemeanors, and the prospect of jail time will serve to make people think twice before violating the law."
A new bill introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives would amend the Horse Protection Act (HPA) of 1970 by imposing stiffer penalties on anyone who sores a horse.
Currently the HPA establishes penalties for violators including maximum fines up to $3,000, imprisonment up to one year, or both.
That bill would have amended the HPA by stiffening soring penalties, however HR 6388 died in committee.
If passed, HR1518 would boost maximum HPA violation penalties to $5,000, imprisonment up to three years, or both.
The bill also increases penalties for those who disobey disqualification orders and for those who fail to pay a licensed HPA compliance inspector at horse shows, sales, and other events.
In addition, the bill would also require the USDA to assign a licensed inspector if a Tennessee Walking Horse show management indicates its intent to hire one; the option of hiring of a licensed inspector remains voluntary under the proposed bill.
Michael R. Inman, chief executive officer of the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, and spokesman for Sound Horses, Honest Judging Objective inspections, Winning Fairly (SHOW), the horse industry organization that manages the flagship Tennessee Walking Horse industry event, said SHOW “is committed to the welfare of the Tennessee Walking show horse,” but was disappointed in the bill's proposed ban on pads.
"The Humane Society of the United States Announces $10,000 Reward for Information on Horse Soring
The Humane Society of the United States has announced it will offer a reward of $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of any violator of Tennessees horse soring law, which prohibits the deliberate infliction of pain to horses feet to produce an artificially high-stepping gait.
Ads announcing the reward will appear throughout middle Tennessee, an area still believed to be a hotbed of soring activity.
Soring - the deliberate infliction of pain upon a horse to increase the animals entertainment or monetary value - is incredibly cruel, and must end, said Keith Dane, director of equine protection at The Humane Society of the United States.
The soring of Tennessee Walking Horses and other breeds of gaited show horses is one of the most heinous forms of abuse inflicted upon equines in the U.S.
Pressure shoeing, another especially egregious form of soring, is the abusive technique of cutting a horse's hoof almost to the bloodline so the shoe puts painful pressure on the horse's sole with each stride.
Passage of a federal law (the 1970 Horse Protection Act) has not had the intended effect of eliminating soring.
Tennessee also has a state law prohibiting soring, but enforcement of these laws has proven difficult, and this illegal practice continues on a widespread basis.
The Humane Society of the United States will protect the identity of all callers."
(Oct. 13, 2015)— Despite claims by the performance or “big lick” segment of the Tennessee walking horse industry that the cruel and illegal practice of soring is limited to a few bad actors.
At the 77th Annual Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration – the top event of the performance walking horse show circuit—inspectors identified a total of 261 violations of the Horse Protection Act, a law passed in 1970 to eliminate the cruel practice of “soring” in which trainers use caustic chemicals and invasive shoeing practices to cause pain to the horses’ lower limbs, forcing them to perform the exaggerated, high stepping big lick gait.
USDA inspectors found more than six times the number of violations at this year’s Celebration than did the industry-retained inspectors, and disqualified 181 of the 525 (over 34 percent) horses they inspected—a figure that is congruous with the results at nine other shows the agency attended this year.
At the 2014 Celebration, 52 percent of horses tested were found positive for illegal foreign substances, and 67 percent in 2013.
Eight horses who were sored during The Humane Society of the United States’ undercover investigation of ThorSport Farm— including He’s Vida Blue, Lord Stanley and Play Something Country — were entered in the show and placed in their respective classes, proving that owners and trainers continue to be rewarded for using (and covering up) their abusive methods.
Another horse sored during the investigation, He’s Unleashed, was shown but pulled from competition in the World Grand Championship class and yet another, The Golden Sovereign, was entered but ultimately scratched before competing, for unknown reasons.
1121, federal legislation that will bolster the existing law and end the industry’s failed system of self-regulation, ban the use of devices integral to the practice of soring, strengthen penalties, and make other reforms needed to finally end soring once and for all.
The author completely overlooks or fails to mention, the USDA is charged with enforcement of the Horse Protection Act, including civil penalties of fines and suspensions as well as the power to pursue felony prosecution for violating the Horse Protection Act.
All HIOs are obligated tof notify the USDA of the shows they will be performing inspections at and follow up post show with turning over evidence collected to the USDA.
The USDA can prosecute based on either evidence collected by themselves at shows they attend or evidence turned over by the HIOs (see USDA vs Barney Davis, Eastern District of Tennessee).
Most HIOs do assess fines and suspensions for violation of rules.
Basically, every person who is suspected of abuse is subject to HIO fines and suspensions AND prosecution by the USDA.
Perhaps holding the USDA accountable for not being transparent would be a good start at ensuring a federal law is equally applied to all breeds and equally enforced, rather than putting the blame on Horse Industry Organizations, especially if you bear in mind it’s the USDA that is responsible for certification of HIOs and the fact they have the power to decertify ineffective or corrupt HIOs.
This notice advises the public and the horse industry of the organizations that have a Designated Qualified Person program currently certified by the United States Department of Agriculture and the designated qualified persons currently licensed under each certified organization.
The practice known as "soring" causes a horse to suffer pain in any of its limbs for the purpose of affecting its performance in the show ring.
In 1970, Congress passed the Horse Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1821-1831), referred to below as the Act, to eliminate the practice of soring by prohibiting the showing, selling, or transporting of sored horses.
In 1979, in response to an amendment to the Act, we established regulations under which show management must, to avoid liability for any sore horses that are shown, appoint individuals trained to conduct preshow inspections to detect or diagnose sored horses.

The Horse Protection Act was put in place and is being modified in order to prevent the act of soring, whereby caustic chemicals, foreign materials, or mechanical devices are used on horses in order to enhance gait.
The following is the USDA's current plan for enforcing the Horse Protection Act to prevent soring of horses.
In order to achieve the elimination of soring, this proposal requires acceptance of elementary principles and the elements contained within.
The Congress of the United States and their constituencies have sought to eliminate the practice of soring through passage and execution of the Horse Protection Act (HPA).
Unquestionably, the welfare of horses has been and continues to be the primary concern of Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) veterinarians responsible for the enforcement of the HPA.
APHIS believes that its role in enforcing the HPA should be specifically tailored toward the eventual elimination of soring.
To that end, APHIS now seeks to strengthen USDA certified horse industry organizations with a proactive regulatory program geared toward the curtailment of both blatant and inconspicuous methods of soring.
The ideal strategy for the eventual elimination of soring would be the establishment of an effective program of self-regulation for USDA certified horse industry organizations.
Providing educational programs to strengthen HPA enforcement and compliance.
Detection methods must continuously advance, becoming increasingly more sophisticated as soring techniques change and take on new applications.
Continuous research on soring practices and the effects on horses is essential to achieving this goal.
The Horse Protection Act was passed by Congress in 1970, and Federal veterinarians began its enforcement by attending horse shows in 1972.
Despite over 20 years of government intervention and regulation, and an amendment to the Act to incorporate Designated Qualified Persons (DQPs), the practice of soring continues.
Recent DQP assessed violations when APHIS is not in attendance at a show/sale have approximated DQP assessed violations when APHIS is in attendance.
APHIS continues to support the elimination of soring practices and the work of DQPs to that end.
APHIS concern that the elimination of soring is not equally shared by all of industry.
Dissatisfaction with lack of exploration of alternative methods of evaluating/detecting soring through research.
The enforcement of the HPA through a self-regulatory work structure is consistent with the APHIS vision.
Team-based leadership between APHIS and the horse industry is the first step in achieving our mutual goal of eliminating the illegal practice of soring.
a. Assign Horse Protection inspection teams to shows.
d. Submit show schedules and DQP assignments to APHIS regional offices in a timely manner.
At the time a reprimand is requested by the APHIS inspection team, the DQP in question will be informed at the end of the show/sale with a notification ticket.
After receiving a letter of reprimand that DQP must apprentice under a USDA inspection team for a minimum of two shows/sales.
Actions taken against unaffiliated shows include:
Use of current administrative hearing process against show management/ exhibitor/trainer.
USDA personnel will continue to work both affiliated and unaffiliated shows for the 1996 show season.
If and when horse industry organization self-regulation successfully demonstrates effectiveness, USDA emphasis will be shifted more to unaffiliated shows.
Foreign Substance--disqualification from the show.
Bilateral/Unilateral aversion to palpation--disqualification from the show.
Repetitive violators would be levied more severe penalties.
Post-show violators would not only be assessed appropriate penalties, but also would forfeit trophies, prizes, or class/category point awards.
In the event that more than one violation is assessed, all penalties would be applied and suspensions cumulatively served.
Thermography and other methods to detect soring.
Pathological/physiological effects of soring upon horses.
The HPA prohibits horses subjected to a process called soring from participating in exhibitions, sales, shows, or auctions.
Horse Protection Act (HPA; US)
The Horse Protection Act (HPA; 15 U.S.C. 1821-1831) was passed in 1970.
The HPA is primarily directed at a practice called “soring,” that is the use of chemicals, “pressure,” the burning, cutting or scoring of a horses foot or leg, and the use of specially designed horse shoes which produces lameness (i.e., soreness) that can cause a horse to lifts its feet rapidly when walking to produce a fanciful gait.
Soring began to emerge in the 1950s in an effort to give those willing to use this practice an edge in horse show events.
The HPA makes it illegal to show, sell, transport, auction, exhibit, receive or offer for sale a horse that has been purposefully sored.
Violations of the HPA may be pursued civilly or criminally.
Civil fines may range to $ 50,000 and can include the suspension of show/exhibition/sale licenses.
Criminal penalties may include fines up to $5,000 as well as imprisonment for a period of up to two years.
APHIS’s enforcement budget is quite small (less than $700,000 annually) making it difficult for AHPIS to regulate the practice of soring, and to attend all horse shows and exhibitions where sored horses may be on display.
In order to enhance enforcement of the HPA, in 1976 Congress amended the HPA to allow the use of Designated Qualified Persons (DQP) to help enforce the HPA as horse show events.
The DQP is appointed by horse show officials to identify horses that have been sored.

We may not have served in Congress for the same party, but we share a common goal today: to crack down on the inhumane practice of “soring”—intentionally injuring the hooves and legs of Tennessee walking horses and related breeds to force them to perform an exaggerated, high-stepping gait known as the “Big Lick.”
The Big Lick wins ribbons at horse shows across the country at the expense of the docile, trusting horses who are tortured day in and day out by their trainers.
One of us, representing Maryland, first took on this effort by authoring the Horse Protection Act, which passed in 1970 and made it a crime to exhibit, sell or transport a sored horse.
R.3268, is cosponsored by 50 senators and 240 representatives currently and will close loopholes that violators have exploited to carry on the unfair, illegal and cruel practice of soring.
The small subset of owners and trainers in the walking horse world that engages in soring has developed a variety of gruesome tactics to inflict pain and force horses to lift their legs higher.
And then these trainers go to great lengths to avoid detection—applying numbing agents to the horse’s legs on the day of the show, and using electric shock and beatings beforehand to train the horse not to react to pain during inspection.
The Horse Protection Act directs the U.S. Department of Agriculture to enforce the law by inspecting horses at shows, but a 1976 amendment allows the walking horse industry to select its own inspectors, many of whom are participants with inherent conflicts of interest.
Supporters of the PAST Act include the American Horse Council, American Veterinary Medical Association, American Association of Equine Practitioners, most major horse breed and show organizations, animal protection groups, and all 50 state veterinary medical associations.
Thanks to the work of brave undercover investigators and former industry insiders, the American public has learned the horrible truth about soring—and they will not stand for it.

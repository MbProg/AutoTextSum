Betjeman entered the University of Oxford with difficulty, having failed the mathematics portion of the university's matriculation exam, Responsions.

Jesus College
Jesus College is unique in that it is the only college at Oxford University to date from the reign of Elizabeth I.
Jesus College actually replaced an earlier academic hall, known as White Hall, which had been established on the spot since the 13th century.
As with many of the early Oxford University colleges, Jesus College was intended as a training institution for clergymen.
The building work may have been financed by a wealthy churchman, Hugh Price (or Aprice).
Jesus College has the reputation of being the major "Welsh" college at Oxford, and certainly a large number of Welsh students have passed through its portals, though nothing in its charter indicates that this was its intended role.
Most of the buildings that make up Jesus College date from the 17th century, though several were remodeled in the Victorian period.
Jesus College
The College Archives contain a wide range of records relating to aspects of the College’s history beginning with Elizabeth I’s foundation charter in 1571.

Full Name:	Jesus College in the University of Oxford of Queen Elizabeth's Foundation
Sister College:	Jesus College, Cambridge
Jesus College (in full: Jesus College in the University of Oxford of Queen Elizabeth's Foundation) is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford in England.
The college was founded by Elizabeth I on 27 June 1571 for the education of clergy, though students now study a broad range of secular subjects.
A major driving force behind the establishment of the college was Hugh Price (or Ap Rhys), a churchman from Brecon in Wales.
See also: List of founding Fellows, Scholars and Commissioners of Jesus College, Oxford.
Jesus College was founded on 27 June 1571, when Elizabeth I issued a royal charter.
[4] The foundation charter named a principal (David Lewis), eight fellows, eight scholars, and eight commissioners to draw up the statutes for the college.
[5] The commissioners included Hugh Price, who had petitioned the queen to found a college at Oxford "that he might bestow his estate of the maintenance of certain scholars of Wales to be trained up in good letters."
The letters patent issued by Elizabeth I made it clear that the education of a priest in the 16th century included more than just theology, however:[7]
[9] Thelwall died on 8 October 1630, aged 68 and was buried in Jesus College Chapel where a monument was erected to his memory by his brother Sir Bevis Thelwall (Page of the King's Bedchamber and Clerk of the Great Wardrobe).
[25] The brochure produced for the opening ceremony noted that the number of science students at the college had increased rapidly in recent years, and that provision of college laboratories would assist the tuition of undergraduates, as well as attracting to Jesus College graduates of the University of Wales who wished to continue their research at Oxford.
See main article: Buildings of Jesus College, Oxford.
The foundation charter gave to the college a site between Market Street and Ship Street (which is still occupied by the college) as well as the buildings of a defunct university academic hall on the site, called White Hall.
In 1863, the architect George Edmund Street was appointed to renovate the chapel.
[36] In contrast, the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner called the reredos "heavily gorgeous".
The hall contains a portrait of Elizabeth I, as well as portraits of former principals and benefactors.
Residential accommodation was first built at the sports ground in 1967 (Thelwall House, rebuilt in 1998), with additions between 1988 and 1990 (Hugh Price House and Leoline Jenkins House).
[65] [66] The Ship Street Centre was officially opened by the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, Lord Patten of Barnes, on 25 September 2010.
See main article: List of Principals and Fellows of Jesus College, Oxford.
To address this, he established two Fellowships at Jesus College, whose holders should serve as clergy "in any of his Majesty's fleets or in his Majesty's plantations" under the direction of the Lord High Admiral and the Bishop of London respectively.
See main article: List of Honorary Fellows of Jesus College, Oxford.
The college's Honorary Fellows have included two Old Members who later became Prime Minister of their respective countries: Norman Washington Manley, who studied at Jesus College as a Rhodes Scholar and who was Chief Minister of Jamaica from 1955 to 1962, and Harold Wilson, who was twice British Prime Minister (1964–1970 and 1974–1976).

See main article: Jesus College Boat Club (Oxford).
Jesus College Boat Club (commonly abbreviated to JCBC) is the rowing club for members of the college.
[124] [125] [126] [127] Jesus boats have also had other successful seasons: the 1896 Jesus College boat had a reputation of being one of the faster boats in the university,[128] and the women's 1st VIII of 1993 won their "blades" in the first divisions of both Torpids and Eights Week, an achievement that led to the crew being described in the Jesus College Record as vying "not just for the College team of the decade, but perhaps for the team of the last three decades", in any sport.
Despite the links with Wales that Hugh Price and many of the founding Fellows had, neither the 1571 charter nor any of the later charters limited entry to the college to Welshmen.
[148] [149] The arms are not those of Hugh Price.
[155] One suggestion (by Paul Langford, the Rector of Lincoln College) is that Jesus College continued the arms adopted by a theological college founded by Rotherham in his home town – Jesus College, Rotherham – which had been suppressed in the time of Edward VI.
The arms of Maud Green, Lady Parr, mother of Catherine Parr (the last of the six wives of Henry VIII and stepmother to Elizabeth I), were of three stags on an azure background, and this became one of the elements of the arms of Catherine Parr on her marriage.
These arms for Jesus College could not be confused with those of Lincoln as that College, since 1574, already had a complex tripartite coat granted to it by Richard Lee, Portcullis Pursuivant, in which the colour of the stags in the centre section had been changed to Or (gold) and their attitude to statant.

The first extant document in its history is the letters patent of foundation issued by Queen Elizabeth on 27 June 1571, at the request of Dr. Hugh Price.
This provided for a college consisting of a Principal, eight fellows, and eight scholars to be known as 'Jesus College within the City and University of Oxford of Queen Elizabeth's foundation'.
In the four years 1862 to 1865, before the universal opening of other scholarships was developed and its influence fully felt, there were five Welsh scholars of Jesus College in the first class in classics in the first public examination; in the fourteen subsequent years there has been one only.
The first class in classics in the final school would have had no representative from Jesus College in the last sixteen years, but for the marvellous energy and ability of one man, whom I should pain if I mentioned him by name.
In the five years from October 1873 to October 1878, 188 natives of Wales and Monmouthshire matriculated as members of the University of Oxford, but only 70 of them as members of Jesus College.

… It is not for certainely knowne but generally received by tradition that she gave besides out of Shotover and Stow-Wood all kind of timber for yt parte of ye Building wch was finished by Dr. Hugh Price.'
To this was added 'the money left by Principal Powell' and £300 from the benefaction of Hugh Price.
Of this system the Laboratories of Jesus College will form a part, and it is intended that the Undergraduate Members of the College should still receive the full benefit of the special instruction given in other laboratories.
The School of Holbein is represented by Hugh Price.
The most important source for this period is the MS. 'The estate of Jesus College in Oxon', attributed to Griffith Powell.
This and other early material has been fully used by E. G. Hardy, Jesus College (1899).
The history of this period has been more recently dealt with by T. Richards in The Puritan Visitation of Jesus College, Oxford and the Principalship of Dr. Michael Roberts.

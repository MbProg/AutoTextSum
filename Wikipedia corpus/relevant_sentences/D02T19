During World War 2, President Franklin D.Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill pooled their nations' resources in the desperate race to beat the Germans to the secret of the atomic bomb.
In addition, the two dozen scientists who collaborated with their American and Canadian allies were to have a profound effect on the post-War world, helping to shape the nuclear programs of the United States, Great Britain and, more controversially, the USSR.
When the [nuclear] tests are completed, as they soon will be, we shall be in the same position as the United States or Soviet Russia.
The first theoretically sound critical mass calculation was made in England by Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls in Feb. 1940.
The mission made major contributions to the Manhattan Project, and provided the nucleus for British post-war atomic weapons development effort.
Immediately after World War II, on 29 August 1945, the new Labor government headed by Prime Minister Clement Attlee convened a organized a secret Cabinet committee on atomic energy to establish nuclear policy.
Lord Portal can be thought of as the "British Leslie Groves" who directed the Manhattan Project in the U.S.
The Manhattan Project
World War II started on September 1 1939, when Germany attacked Poland.
Even before its entry into the war, the United States had become very concerned with the nuclear threat of the Axis powers.
The United States introduced its own nuclear program under the Army Corps of Engineers in June 1942.
The program that developed the atomic bomb for the United States during World War II was the largest secret project ever undertaken by the U.S. government.
Since it was frequently the case the US Army Corps of Engineers offices were named for the city in which they were based, it was renamed Manhattan Engineering District, which became known as the Manhattan Project.
Though it eventually included over 30 different research and production sites, the Manhattan Project was chiefly carried out in three secret scientific cities: Hanford, Washington, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Los Alamos, New Mexico.
The Manhattan Project produced three bombs: the first bomb was known as "Gadget" and was used as a test model.
The history of the Manhattan Project remained classified for many years.
In fact, it was so secret that Harry S. Truman, although vice president of the United States, was not made aware of its existence until after the death of Roosevelt in 1945.
The Manhattan Project allowed the United States to unlock the mysteries of the atom, but it also introduced the most destructive creation of warfare known to mankind.

18 Interesting Facts About The Manhattan Project
The Manhattan Project was one of the major successes in the field of nuclear science.
Let’s unveil some interesting facts about the Manhattan Project.
Einstein was not the part of the Manhattan Project, as he did not get the security clearance required for the project from the U.S. Army Intelligence office.
Oak Ridge Wise MonkeysManhattan Project was the top-secret project because U.S. was worried that enemies like Germany and Japan would learn about the nuclear technology and could use it in escalating their nuclear weapons.
In order to ensure the safety of employees in the Manhattan Project radiation they used detectors to check the amount of radiation at the lab sites.
Manhattan Project employees
As per the 1945 “Life” article before the bombings, not more than a few dozen men in the whole nation knew the full meaning of the Manhattan Project and only a thousand others were aware that work on atoms was involved.
As the program began under the Manhattan Engineering District so eventually it became the Manhattan Project.
William Penney, Otto Frisch, Rudolf Peierls and John Cockroft
During the World War II Britain helped the Unites States to initiate the formation of first atomic bombs.
Soon Frisch–Peierls memorandum provoked Britain to make its own project.
Earlier, Britain had a more advanced project but as the United States entered the war, it overshadowed Britain’s project.
The project took less than four years for its completion and the construction sites included four cities of United States i.e. Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Hanford, and Washington.
Mark Oliphant Biography
Mark Oliphant (1901–2000) was considered a great leader in the sciences, one who inspired his students by his own show of zeal for his research and his positive view of life in general.
In 1937 Oliphant took a position with the University of Birmingham, where he became a professor of physics.
It was this radar that helped the fight against the German U-boats and bomber offensives during World War II.
Because of the advent of World War II he was unable to finish the project until 1950.
World War II Brought About Atom Bomb
In 1940 two men, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, who also worked at the University of Birmingham, theorized that uranium-235 could be used to create an atom bomb.
Maud in turn sent the theory to the United States and its Uranium Committee in March of 1941, but the United States seemed to be uninterested in the idea, as they made no reply to the report.
Because of his efforts, the United States established the Office of Scientific Research and Development.
This office took on the Uranium Committee as one of its projects, and in December of 1941, after Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese, they set up the Manhattan Engineering District to house what would soon be called the Manhattan Project, to research the building of a uranium atom bomb.
Oliphant moved to America in November of 1943 to work on the Manhattan Project, sent as a British delegate.
After VE-Day he returned to the University of Birmingham to continue on as professor of physics.
The Economist wrote, "Like many of the scientists who helped to make the atomic bomb, Mark Oliphant expressed dismay when it was used to destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Many locations have been named after the great scientist, including the Mark Oliphant Conservation Park, the Oliphant building at Australian National University, the Oliphant wing of the Physics Building at the University of Adelaide and the Mark Oliphant Building in Bedford Park, South Australia.

With his German-British collaborator Rudolf Peierls[1] he designed the first theoretical mechanism for the detonation of an atomic bomb in 1940.
In the Summer of 1939 Frisch left Denmark for what he anticipated would be a short trip to Birmingham, but the outbreak of World War II precluded his return.
With war on his mind, he and the physicist Rudolf Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum at Birmingham University, which was the first document to set out a process by which an atomic explosion could be generated.
This memorandum was the basis of British work on building an atomic device (the Tube Alloys project) and also that of the Manhattan Project on which Frisch worked as part of the British delegation.
Frisch and Rudolf Peierls worked together in the Physics Department at Birmingham University 1939–40.

The Atomic Bomb produced by the Manhattan Project
During 1939 and early 1940, Frisch, who was "stuck" in Britain because of the war, and German-born Rudolf Peierls, worked on the practical calculations of what it would take to actually create an atomic bomb.
The Manhattan Project
The US Army Corps of Engineers' project leadrship was located at an office in Manhattan, New York, which gave the entire project its unofficial but well known name, the Manhattan Project.
The project progressed, still somewhat slowly, until Vannevar Bush, the head of the US Office of Scientific Research and Development, decided that aggressively efficient leadership was required, and on Spetember 23, 1942, Leslie Groves, an Army engineer who distinguished himself in overseeing the initial construction of the Pentagon, was appointed to command the Manhattan Project.
The main tasks of the Manhattan Project were to :

The Manhattan Project in Action
Manhattan Project
United States history
Manhattan Project, U.S. government research project (1942–45) that produced the first atomic bombs.
After the U.S. entry into World War II, the War Department was given joint responsibility for the project, because by mid-1942 it was obvious that a vast array of pilot plants, laboratories, and manufacturing facilities would have to be constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers so that the assembled scientists could carry out their mission.
“Manhattan Project” became the code name for research work that would extend across the country.
In that year a number of scientists of those countries moved to the United States to join the project there.
By this time the original $6,000 authorized for the Manhattan Project had grown to $2 billion.
The Manhattan Project: Making the Atomic Bomb
Einstein believed the German government was actively supporting research in this area and urged the United States government to do likewise.
Einstein drafted his famous letter with the help of the Hungarian émigré physicist Leo Szilard, one of a number of European scientists who had fled to the United States in the 1930s to escape Nazi and Fascist repression.
In fact, Roosevelt's approval of uranium research in October 1939, based on his belief that the United States could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to achieve unilateral possession of "extremely powerful bombs," was merely the first decision among many that ultimately led to the establishment of the only atomic bomb effort that succeeded in World War II-the Manhattan Project.
Consequently, the British acceded, reluctantly, to American leadership and sent scientists to every Manhattan Project facility.
Only the Americans, late entrants into World War II and protected by oceans on both sides, managed to take the discovery of fission from the laboratory to the battlefield and gain a shortlived atomic monopoly.
Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Emilio Segre, Lise Meitner, Otto Frisch, Joseph Rotblat and Rudolf Peierls were all Jewish scientists who fled Germany or occupied countries to escape anti-Semitism.
We were pleased to see the British Mission get screen time on “Manhattan,” as the British contribution to the Manhattan Project is often overlooked.
With the Quebec Agreement signed by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill in August 1943, the British were invited to join the Manhattan Project, despite General Groves’ reservations.
In hindsight, the Manhattan Project may never have succeeded before the end of the war without the contributions of the British.
Other notables included Cyril Smith, a renowned metallurgist, and Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, who assessed the chances of developing an atomic bomb.
Like in the show, many of the wives had at least part-time jobs in the real Manhattan Project.

University of Birmingham's pivotal role in the invention of nuclear weapons
This March marks the anniversary of the little known memorandum composed by University of Birmingham physicists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who were both refugees from the Nazis.
Far-sighted Birmingham professor Mark Oliphant offered places to the two refugees.
But in the University of Birmingham’s physics department, these two researchers were to work for another two years, at benches side by side, and with crucial access to the cyclotron.
From that the ‘Manhattan Project’ was born, and, with British help, the bomb was developed in time to end the war.
It is a play by Tom Moreton-Smith and takes us into the heart of the Manhattan Project revealing the personal cost of making history.
Rudolf Peierls' parents were Heinrich Peierls and Elizabeth Weigert and he was their only child.
After six months of intense correspondence by letter, Rudolf Peierls travelled to Leningrad again in March 1931, and during his brief stay - much to the dismay of his surprised family - married Genia.
This process took time and when World War II began the process was still not complete and Peierls and his wife were both classified as enemy aliens.
However, undertaking war work was still difficult and this would prove particularly so when, together with Otto Frisch (an Austrian), he made it known to the British government through the 3-page Frisch-Peierls memorandum that he had the theoretical knowledge to make an atomic bomb from uranium-235 a possibility.
Early in 1941 Peierls invited Klaus Fuchs to join him, Otto Frisch and James Chadwick, in the work on the theoretical side of the British project to develop an atomic bomb.
In August 1943 the Quebec Conference set up a formal collaboration between Britain and the United States on nuclear weapons research and, after a fact finding mission by Peierls in Washington, all the key British researchers joined the Manhattan Project.
Peierls worked first in New York then at Los Alamos until the end of World War II, when he returned to Birmingham.
His applications for a visa to visit the United States met with long delays.
In 1997, two years after his death, Selected scientific papers of Sir Rudolf Peierls was published.
Sir Rudolf Peierls was probably the most influential of the German mathematical physicists who migrated and settled in Britain during the Nazi era.
Nuclear decay: Haunting images show the remnants of the Manhattan Project mission to build first atomic bomb
It's almost 70 years since America ushered in the atomic age and, as the threat of nuclear weapons remains, the remnants of the Manhattan Project are still visible across the United states.
The Manhattan Project was sparked when Albert Einstein wrote to then President Franklin D. Roosevelt informing him that Nazi Germany was working towards a similar end-game.
But he added that appreciation of the monumental achievements of the Manhattan Project could not be considered 'without a pang of regret at what it unleashed into the world.'
Progress was slow, the initial results were discouraging, and, following the outbreak of World War II, the effort was reduced and resources were moved to more pressing and more promising defence projects.
The MAUD Committee programme was described and was found to parallel the United States programme, although the latter was being conducted with somewhat less urgency.
Meanwhile, in the United States Dr. Vannevar Bush, head of the National Defense Research Committee, had asked the president of the National Academy of Sciences in April 1941 to appoint a committee of physicists to review the uranium problem.
The change in the United States' attitude toward cooperating with Britain came as a great shock to the British.
The draft agreement included a statement of the necessity for the bomb project to be a completely joint effort, a pledge that neither country would use the bomb against the other, a further pledge that neither country would use the bomb against or disclose it to a third party without mutual consent, and recognition of the United States' right to limit whatever postwar commercial advantages of the project might accrue to Great Britain.
These provisions together with the points in the draft agreement were incorporated in the Quebec Agreement, which was signed by Roosevelt and Churchill on 19 August 1943.
Of pre-eminent importance was the rapport established between General Groves and Professor James Chadwick, senior technical adviser to the British members of the Combined Policy Committee.
He concluded that this would best be achieved by sending British scientists to work in the United States.
There is no objective way of measuring the contribution made by the British to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and elsewhere.
General Groves often acknowledged the importance of the early work in the United Kingdom and the substantial contribution made by her scientists in America, but he added that the United States could have got along without them.
The social triumph of the collaboration between the British and the Americans on the Manhattan Project was a celebratory party hosted by the British Mission.
Whatever the variations in the opinions of the British contributions to the Manhattan Project, there is no dispute that their participation benefited the British considerably.
While United States law prohibited international cooperation on nuclear weapon design, the British were able to undertake a successful independent nuclear weapons programme, which, despite its small scale relative to that of the American programme, succeeded in elucidating all the essential principles of both fission and thermonuclear warheads and in producing an operational nuclear weapons capability.
When the two countries came together again in 1958, following a critical amendment to the 1954 United States Atomic Energy Act, the developments in nuclear weapons technology over the previous eleven years were found to be remarkably similar.
Timeline of the Manhattan Project
Timeline of the Manhattan Project
Timelines of World War II
The Manhattan Project was a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II.
It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada.
The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2 billion (about $26 billion in 2014[1] dollars).
The following is a timeline of the Manhattan Project.
It includes a number of events prior to the official formation of the Manhattan Project, and a number of events after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, until the Manhattan Project was formally replaced by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1947.
September 3: Great Britain and France declare war on Nazi Germany in response to its invasion of Poland, beginning World War II.
March: Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls author the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, calculating that an atomic bomb might need as little as 1 pound (0.45 kg) of enriched uranium to work.
The memorandum is given to Mark Oliphant, who in turn hands it over to Sir Henry Tizard.
August: Mark Oliphant travels to USA to urge development of a bomb rather than power production.
The United States and Great Britain issue a formal declaration of war against Japan the next day.
December 11: United States declares war on Germany and Italy.
July 30: Sir John Anderson urges Prime Minister Winston Churchill to pursue a joint project with the United States.
August 13: The Manhattan Engineering District is established by the Chief of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold, effective August 16.
September 26: The Manhattan Project is given permission to use the highest wartime priority rating by the War Production Board.
September 8: First meeting of the Combined Policy Committee, established by the Quebec Agreement to coordinate the efforts of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.
United States Secretary of War Henry Stimson, Bush and Conant are the American members; Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin are the British members, and C. D. Howe is the Canadian member.
May 7: Nazi Germany formally surrenders to Allied powers, marking the end of World War II in Europe;[73] 100-ton test explosion at Alamogordo, New Mexico.
July 24: President Harry S. Truman discloses to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin that the United States has atomic weapons.
September 8: Manhattan Project survey group under Farrell arrives in Nagasaki.
August 1: Truman signs the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 into law, ending almost a year of uncertainty about the control of atomic research in the postwar United States.
January 1: the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (known as the McMahon Act) takes effect, and the Manhattan Project is officially turned over to the United States Atomic Energy Commission.
Manhattan Project Chronology from Department of Energy's The Manhattan Project: Making the Atomic Bomb
Conant on the Role of the British in the Manhattan Project
The Manhattan Project was a joint effort to build the atomic bomb between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
In practice, most of the labor, expense, and manpower came from the United States, and the degree to which the UK and Canada should be equal partners with the US in the bomb project was a controversial subject.
Did the United States need the British?
Not really, thought James B. Conant, President of Harvard, chairman of the National Defense Research Committee1, and close friend of Vannevar Bush (director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, which was the civilian side of the Manhattan Project).
So under this scheme, the British would only get to participate in the parts that they themselves were working on which would actually get them closer to making an atomic bomb during World War II.
The advantages of restricting all further information to the United States is obvious.
There would be many more salvos on this front as Conant and Bush frantically tried to persuade Roosevelt not to let the British into the full, new Manhattan Project.
But however persuasive Vannevar Bush could be, he couldn’t match up to Winston Churchill.
Frisch–Peierls memorandum
University of Birmingham - Poynting Physics Building - blue plaque to phyicists Frisch and Peierls
The Frisch–Peierls memorandum was the first technical exposition of a practical atomic weapon.
[1] Written by Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls in March 1940 while they were both working at the University of Birmingham in England, the memorandum contained new calculations about the size of the critical mass needed for an atomic bomb, and helped accelerate British and U.S. efforts towards bomb development during World War II.
The memorandum helped galvanize both Britain and America down a path which led to a report by the British MAUD Committee, the Tube Alloys project, the Manhattan Project, and ultimately the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
There was a great turnout for the Los Alamos Historical Society's viewing of the eighth episode of WGN's new series, Manhattan, a fictionalized look at life in Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project.
British scientists did come to Los Alamos to work on the Manhattan Project.
Prior to British scientists coming to America to work on the Manhattan Project, the Quebec Agreement was written and signed by Roosevelt and Churchill in August 1943.
The expertise the British Mission provided to the Manhattan Project was invaluable and essential to the success of the Project.
Abby's realization of the horrifying events happening in Europe during World War II center around a city named Minsk.
Minsk was a part of the USSR during World War II with a population of 270,000.
Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run ghettos during World War II, which held over 100,000 Jews.

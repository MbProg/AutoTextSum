John Nash's Architecture
One of the greatest architects of metropolitan London during the Regency era (c.1810-30), John Nash was a highly original and prolific designer, best known for the neoclassical architecture he used in the Marylebone region of London, notably Regent's Park (1812-27), an impressive complex of rigorously classical buildings.
After this came the redesign of Buckingham House, creating Buckingham Palace (1825–1830), followed by the Royal Mews (1822–24) and Marble Arch (1828).

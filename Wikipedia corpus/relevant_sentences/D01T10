The Blind Leading the Blind

The Blind Leading the Blind, a series of sightless eyes and stumbling men, inspired one of the most poignant photographs of the Great War: a progression of British soldiers, blinded by poison gas, bandaged and shuffling toward the refuge of a field hospital.
Charles Baudelaire writes, “Their eyes, from which the divine spark has departed, as though they were staring into the distance, remain lifted towards the sky.”
The painter also inspired William Carlos Williams’ book of poems, Pictures from Brueghel.

The Blind Leading the Blind, also Blind or The Parable of the Blind, is a 1568 painting by Flemish renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder.
Executed in tempera on linen canvas it is the earliest painting to depict the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from the Gospel of Matthew 15:14.

Breughel achieved such a level of Renaissance realism in The Blind Leading the Blind that the individual inflictions of each of the blind men can be determined, such as black cataracts and corneal leukemia.
The diagonal composition of The Blind Leading the Blind reinforces the off-kilter motion of the six figures falling in progression, a focus on motion that has been seen as prefiguring motion pictures.

Yesterday when I featured the painting by John Singer Sargent, entitled Gassed, I was immediately reminded of a painting by one of my favourite artists, the Flemish genius, Pieter Bruegel the Elder.
The title of Bruegel’s painting derives from a passage in the New Testament (Matthew 15:14) in which Christ is comparing spiritual blindness to physical blindness and talking about inner blindness to religion of some people.
The Pieter Brueghel the Younger version
It is a beautifully crafted painting and it is interesting to note that Bruegel’s elder son, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, made a copy of his father’s painting soon after his father died.

THE PARABLE OF THE BLIND By Gert Hofmann.
THE prizewinning West German playwright and essayist Gert Hofmann began publishing fiction in 1979, at the age of 47.
The subject is Bruegel's painting of the same name: in the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Pictures From Brueghel and Other Poems'' (1962), William Carlos Williams called the canvas ''this horrible but superb painting,'' a laconic gloss on an equally laconic pictorial reading of Matthew 15:14 -''Let [ the Pharisees ] alone: they be blind leaders of the blind.
For if Bruegel's blind men are alone in the landscape, Gert Hofmann's canvas is crowded with people.
THE paradox is evident, and conveys the paradox of Gert Hofmann's own work.

Convention of 1832

Texas Revolution
The Texas Revolution began with the Battle of Gonzales in October 1835 and ended with the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836; but there were earlier clashes between official forces and groups of colonists, so that it is impossible to set dogmatic limits in speaking of military episodes alone, to say nothing of the development of social and political differences that were a part of the revolution.The seeds of these differences were planted in the national habits and experiences of Mexican rulers and Anglo-American occupants of Texas.
Misunderstanding was aggravated in the minds of Mexicans by the conviction that the United States government was not above making use of the colonists to cause trouble in the hope of acquiring Texas by purchase or revolution.
Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna was leading a revolution against President Anastacio Bustamante at the time of these disturbances in Texas, and the colonists who participated in them declared that they were cooperating with him by expelling Bustamante's garrisons from Texas.
Actually, the great mass of the colonists had no quarrel with Mexico or Mexicans and adopted resolutions assuring the authorities of their loyalty-at least, they wanted no war with Mexico.
The colonists held the Convention of 1832 and Convention of 1833 and asked for a number of privileges and reforms, of which three were the most important.
(1) In September 1823, Congress had given the colonists certain tariff exemptions for seven years.
The Convention of 1833 went so far as to frame a constitution for the approval of Congress (see CONSTITUTION PROPOSED IN 1833).
(3) Apprehension over heavy Anglo-American colonization led Congress to pass the Law of April 6, 1830, forbidding immigrants to settle in territory adjacent to their native country.
Resolutions of the Convention of 1832 were never delivered; but Austin, elected to present the petitions of 1833, arrived in Mexico City in July.
Reports continued, however, that Santa Anna was bent upon military occupation of Texas, and a group of colonists published a call for election of delegates to a convention, or consultation, in October.
At the Battle of Gonzales, what is regarded as the first shot in the Texas Revolution was fired.
History of the Texas Revolution
The Texas Revolution began with the battle of Gonzales in October 1835 and ended with the battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836; but there were earlier clashes between official forces and groups of colonists.
This is a brief history of the Texas Revolution.
Misunderstanding was aggravated in the minds of Mexicans by their conviction that the United States government wan making use of the colonists to cause trouble in the hope of acquiring Texas by purchase or revolution.
Antonio López de Santa Anna was leading a revolution against President Anastacio Bustamante at the time of these disturbances in Texas, and the colonists who participated in them declared that they were cooperating with him by expelling Bustamante's garrisons from Texas.
Actually, the great mass of the colonists had no quarrel with Mexico or Mexicans and adopted resolutions assuring the authorities of their loyalty-at least, they wanted no war with Mexico.
The colonists held the Conventions of 1832 and 1833 and asked for an extension of the tariff exemptions and to make Texas an independent state.
However, the Mexican government was very apprehensive over heavy Anglo­A merican colonization so they passed the Law of April 6, 1830, forbidding immigrants to settle in territory adjacent to their native country.
Resolutions of the Texian Convention of 1832 were never delivered to Mexico but instead, Stephen F. Austin was sent to Mexico City to present the petitions of 1833.

When a Government has ceased to protect the lives, liberty, and property of the People from whom its legitimate powers are derived, and for the advancement of whose happiness it was instituted, and so far from being a guarantee for the enjoyment of their inestimable and inalienable rights, becomes an instrument in the hands of evil rules for their oppression: when the Federal Republican Constitution of their country, which they have sworn to support, no longer has a substantial existence, and the whole nature of their Government has been forcibly changed, without their consent, from a restricted Federative Republic, composed of sovereign States, to a consolidated central military despotism, in which every interest is disregarded but that of the army and the priesthood, both the eternal enemies of civil liberty, the ever-ready minions of power, and the usual instruments tyrants: when, long after the spirit of the constitution has departed, moderation is at length so far lost by those in power, that even the semblance of freedom is removed, and the forms themselves of the Constitution discontinued; and so far from their petitions and remonstrances being regarded, the agents who bear them are thrown into dungeons and mercenary armies sent forth to force a new Government upon them at the point of the bayonet: when, in consequence of such acts of malfeasance and abdication on the part of the Government, anarchy prevails, and civil society is dissolved into its original elements: in such a crisis, the first law of nature, the right of self-preservation, the inherent and inalienable right of the People to appeal to first principles, and take their political affairs into their own hands in extreme cases enjoins it as a right towards themselves, and a sacred obligation to their posterity, to abolish such Government, and create another in its stead, calculated to rescue them from impending dangers, and to secure their future welfare and happiness.
The Mexican Government, by its colonization laws, invited and induced the Anglo-American population of Texas to colonize its wilderness, under the pledged faith of a written constitution, that they should continue to enjoy that constitutional liberty and republican Government to which they had been habituated in the land of their birth, the United States of America.
As the delegates worked, they received regular reports on the ongoing siege on the Alamo by the forces of Santa Anna's troops.
The battle of San Jacinto was the concluding military event of the Texas Revolution.
Woll's expedition was part of the continued skirmishing that went on between the Texas Revolution and the Mexican War.
In 1832 Woll supported the pronunciamento against President Anastasio Bustamante that brought Gen. M. Gómez Pedraza to the presidency.
After the Texas Revolution, Woll played an inconspicuous role in Mexican affairs.
The Convention of 1833 (April 1–13, 1833), a political gathering of settlers in Mexican Texas, was a successor to the Convention of 1832, whose requests had not been addressed by the Mexican government.
Despite the political uncertainty resulting from a recently concluded civil war, 56 delegates met in San Felipe de Austin to draft a series of petitions to the Mexican government.
Although the convention's agenda largely mirrored that of the Convention of 1832, delegates also agreed to pursue independent statehood for the province, which was at the time part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas.
Under the guidance of Sam Houston, former governor of the US state of Tennessee, a committee drafted a state constitution to submit to the Mexican Congress.
The proposed constitution was largely patterned on US political principles, yet retained several Spanish customs.
During his imprisonment, the federal and state legislatures later passed a series of measures to placate the colonists, including the introduction of trial by jury.
Mexican Texas, which marked the country's eastern border with the United States, was combined with Coahuila to form the new state Coahuila y Tejas.
[4][5] To curb the perceived threat, the Mexican government passed the Law of April 6, 1830, which restricted immigration from the United States into Texas and called for the first enforcement of customs duties.
In 1832, General Antonio López de Santa Anna led a revolt against President Anastasio Bustamante's centralist government.
In 1832, General Antonio López de Santa Anna led a revolt against President Anastasio Bustamante's centralist government.
[10] Although the two municipalities with the largest Tejano populations, San Antonio de Béxar and Victoria, refused to participate, 55 delegates met in October for the Convention of 1832.
[10] After approving the list of resolutions, delegates created a seven-member central committee to convene future meetings.
[14] The president of the Convention of 1832, Stephen F. Austin, traveled to San Antonio de Béxar to garner support for the changes the convention had requested.
The governor of Coahuila y Tejas had died in September 1832, and his replacement, federalist Juan Martín de Veramendi, immediately dissolved the state legislature, which had centralist leanings.
Communities in Texas elected 56 delegates for the new convention.
[17] In a departure from the previous election, San Antonio de Béxar also sent delegates, including James Bowie, the son-in-law of Governor Veramendi.
Bowie, like many of his fellow delegates, was known as an agitator who wanted immediate change.
[18] The majority of the delegates to the previous convention had been more cautious.
On the first day, several delegates addressed the convention to justify the recent Texian actions.
[19] Several delegates argued that the recently concluded civil war had left Mexico in too much turmoil to provide effective rule for Texas.
This delegate overlooked the fact that Texas had been granted two representatives to the Coahuila y Tejas legislature.
State constitution
By the second day of the convention, delegates were in agreement to pursue separate statehood.
[20] Houston was named chairman of a committee to draft a new state constitution.
The new constitution was based on a copy of the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution provided by one of the committee members.
[17] The proposed document also drew from the constitutions of other states in the United States, including Louisiana, Missouri, and Tennessee.
Although it could also be interpreted to imply freedom of religion,[21] delegates were unwilling to explicitly grant that right, knowing that it would cause an uproar in Catholic Mexico.
[24] The proposed constitution forbade the English practices of primogeniture and entailment, following a change made to Spanish law in 1821.
Borrowing from the resolutions of the Convention of 1832,[10] delegates wrote into the constitution a guarantee of free public education.
[23] When the constitution was completed, David G. Burnet headed a subcommittee to craft a letter to Mexican authorities to explain the merits of the proposal.
In addition to the development of a state constitution, delegates passed a series of resolutions that asked Mexican authorities for reforms.
Perhaps to atone for some of the more revolutionary items they had requested, as one of their final acts delegates passed a resolution that condemned the slave trade within Texas.
[23] The Constitution of 1824 had already abolished the slave trade, and the constitution of Coahuila y Tejas had forbidden the importation of slaves into the state.
Because Spain did not officially recognize Mexican independence, delegates considered this trade treasonous to Mexico.
Despite a vocal minority advocating for the unilateral implementation of the proposals, delegates agreed to present the requests to the Mexican Congress for approval.
[31] As their last act, delegates elected Austin, James Miller, and Erasmo Seguín to deliver their petitions to Mexico City.
[32] Other residents suggested that the capital of Coahuila y Tejas should be moved to San Antonio de Béxar, giving Texas more power.
Farías enacted many federalist reforms, which angered citizens and army leaders.
[39] By the time Austin arrived in Mexico City on July 18, several Mexican states had engaged in minor revolts against Farías's reforms.
At Santa Anna's urging, the Coahuila y Tejas legislature enacted several measures to placate the Texians.
Timeline of the Texas Revolution
Convention of 1832 (1 October 1832)
Because of the growing uneasiness with the policies coming from Mexico City, the Texans decided that the time was ripe in mid-1832 to request reforms in government policy.
A total of fifty-eight delegates representing sixteen settlements attended the convention.
Representation from San Antonio, the center for the Mexican colonists in Texas, was conspicuously absent.
The convention adopted resolutions requesting a range of reforms including tariff reduction, the lifting of restrictions on immigration from the United States, the funding of primary schools, and the formation of a separate state of Texas within the Mexican republic.
Martínez warned Austin that the government was unprepared to extend administration over the colonists and that Austin must be responsible for their good conduct.
Austin returned to New Orleans, published these terms, and invited colonists, saying that settlements would be located on the Brazos and Colorado rivers.
The long depression, followed by the panic of 1819 and changes in the land system of the United States, made settlers eager to take advantage of the offer, and the first colonists began to arrive in Texas by land and sea in December 1821.
Austin had complete civil and military authority over his colonists until 1828, subject to rather nominal supervision by the officials at San Antonio and Monterrey.
The labor of directing surveyors, checking their field notes, allocating grants, preparing titles and records, entertaining prospective colonists, corresponding with state and federal officials, punishing hostile Indians, and finding food and presents for friendly visitors to keep them from marauding was heavy and expensive.
To meet current costs, Austin's only resource was to assess fees against the colonists.
A rather veiled provision of the state law of 1825 allowed empresarios to reimburse themselves for costs and services, and under this law Austin required colonists to pay, or promise to pay, first sixty dollars and later fifty dollars a league.
Though his personal circumstances became somewhat easier with the growth of the colonies, he wrote shortly before his death that his wealth was prospective, consisting of the uncertain value of land acquired as compensation for his services as empresario.Besides bringing the colonists to Texas, Austin strove to produce and maintain conditions conducive to their prosperous development.
For example, by an act of September 1823, the federal government relieved the colonists of the payment of tariff duties for seven years; and the state legislature was nearly always reasonably cooperative.
Mexican sentiment sometimes clashed, however, with practical needs of the colonists, and Austin had to evolve or accept a compromise.
With almost no free labor to be hired and expecting most of the colonists to come from the slave states, Austin prevailed on the junta instituyente to legalize slavery in the imperial colonization law, under which the first colony was established.
Contrary to his strenuous efforts, the Constitution of Coahuila and Texas prohibited further introduction of slaves by immigration, but the legislature passed a law at his suggestion that evaded the intent of the constitution by legalizing labor contracts with nominally emancipated slaves.
He appeared to concur, however, when congress prohibited immigration in 1830, and tried to convince the colonists that the long-time interest of Texas would be served by the prohibition.
He vividly pictured the potential evils of slavery and was apparently sincere, but he failed to reconcile the colonists to the law and after 1833 declared consistently that Texas must be a slave state.
Another subject in which the interests of the colonists were deeply involved was their protection from efforts of creditors to collect debts incurred by debtors before they moved to Texas.
In lengthy arguments to various officials, he declared that the coasting trade would establish ties of mutual interest between the colonists and Mexico and enable Mexico to balance imports from England by exporting Texas cotton.
He anticipated and disarmed criticism of inconvenient laws and clumsy administration and then used the patience of the colonists as evidence of good faith in begging the government for concessions.
He thwarted the efforts of Haden Edwards to drag his colonists into the Fredonian Rebellion and led the militia from the Brazos and Colorado to assist Mexican troops in putting it down.
The Law of April 6, 1830, embodied the Mexican policy of stopping the further colonization of Texas by settlers from the United States.
In the meantime, however, military measures to enforce the Law of April 6, 1830, and imprudent administration of the tariff laws, to which the Texans became subject in September 1830, produced the Anahuac Disturbances.
In fact the local authorities, including Ramón Músquiz, the political chief, had quieted and repudiated it, when irresistible circumstances compelled Austin to abandon his well-tried policy of aloofness from national political struggles and adopt the cause of Antonio López de Santa Anna against the incumbent administration of President Anastasio Bustamante.
Fortuitously Santa Anna won, and the colonists could not be diverted from claiming the reward of their valorous support.
The Convention of 1832 met in October of that year to inform the government of the needs of the Texans.
Though Austin was president of the convention, he doubted the expediency of the meeting, fearing that it would stimulate suspicion of the loyalty of the colonists-all the more because the old Mexican inhabitants of San Antonio had sent no delegates to the convention.
It is easy to conclude that Austin held out hope that he might persuade these local Mexicans to take the lead in asking for reforms in a later convention; at any rate, he was in San Antonio engaged on this mission when the ground was cut from under his feet by publication of a call for a second convention to meet at San Felipe on April 1, 1833.
This Convention of 1833 repeated the more important petitions of the previous meeting and went further in framing a constitution to accompany the request for state government.
He left San Felipe in April, arrived in Mexico City in July, and, after unavoidable delays, persuaded the government to repeal the Law of April 6, 1830, and to promise important reforms in Texas local government.
Probably he could have quashed this call, but in a notable speech at Brazoria on September 8 he gave it his sanction, and election of delegates proceeded.
Until the passage of the Law of April 6, 1830, attempting to shut out emigrants from the United States, he believed that Texas could develop into a free and prosperous Mexican state, a goal that he sincerely desired.
Passage of that law and continued political turmoil in Mexico certainly shook his confidence, but prudence forbade abandonment of the policy of outward patience and conciliation before Texas seemed strong enough to demand reforms and back the demand by force.
The Convention of 1832
At any convention, delegates, or people chosen to speak for a group, would discuss issues and decide a course of action.
Meeting at San Felipe de Austin, these delegates chose Stephen F. Austin as their leader.
All these delegates wanted change in Texas
They also wanted Texas to be a separate Mexican state because at the time Texas was part of a bigger state called Coahuila y Tejas
According to Mexican Law, The Convention of 1832 was not a legal meeting.
Because the delegates had not met legally, Ramon Musquiz refused to send their requests to the Mexican Government.
So The Convention of 1832 failed...
The delegates in this convention were firmer than the first.
The delegates this time asked for better mail service, improved defense against the Native American Raids, the right to use English in business and law, they again demanded an end to the ban against immigration, more money for better schooling, and they urged that Texas should be a separate Mexican State.
"Texas suffered as a part of Coahuila y Tejas," said Burnet.
The last part of The Convention of 1833 was to draft a constitution for Texas.
The special task of drafting a constitution for Texas was rested upon newcomer's Sam Houston's shoulders.
The delegates took a strong stand in favor of Texas Statehood.
What are delegates?
Who made the constitution for Texas and what did he call Texas?
As late as November, 1835, the Texans declared in convention that â€œthey will continue faithful to the Mexican Government as long as that nation is governed by the constitution and laws that were formed for the government of the political associates.â€  When Santa Anna and the other military chieftains overthrew the federal constitution of Mexico and dissolved the social compact which existed between Texas and other members of the Mexican Confederacy, the Texans declared that â€œthey were no longer morally or politically bound by the compact of the union * * * yet they offered their support and assistance to such members of the Mexican Confederacy as will take up arms against military despotism.â€
For years the leaders among the colonists had advised patience and forbearance, hoping that a peaceful solution of the troubles arising could be reached without resorting to war.
The Consultation that met at San Felipe in November, 1835, was the first time the colonists had publicly expressed a spirit of rebellion against Mexican despotism.
And even then there were those among the delegates to this convention who were hopeful that a permanent separation from Mexico might be averted, and contented themselves by having the convention to declare that â€œthey hold it to be right, during the disorganization of the Federal System and the reign of despotism, to withdraw from the Union and establish an independent government or adopt such measures as they may deem best calculated to protect their rights and liberties.â€
It will be recalled that in 1832, and again in 1833, the colonists held conventions in which they united in presenting to Santa Anna their grievances arising from the passage of laws and decrees during the brief reign of Bustamante.
The Convention of 1833 adopted a Constitution for the Sate and elected Stephen F. Austin, Dr. John B. Miller and Erasmo Seguin, commissioners to present the memorial and constitution to the Government at the City of Mexico and ask for the ratification of the State constitution.
When Austin reached home he found the colonists organizing for defense, and recommended the calling of a general consultation to outline a course of procedure.
While this convention was in session the first battle of the Texas Revolution was fought near Gonzales.
The convention at Old Washington was the fourth convention held by the Texas colonists represented by regularly elected delegates from the people.
When this decree was promulgated it created great alarm among the Texans, as it was violative of the Constitution of 1824 and was known to be aimed directly at the peace and quiet of the colonists.
A convention was called to meet at San Felipe, October 1, 1832, for the purpose of enabling the colonists to present to the Mexican Government certain conditions which had greatly disturbed the quiet of the colonists.
The convention met at San Felipe, October 1, 1832, and fifty six delegates took their seats.
This committee was also instructed to set out a record of toils, difficulties and dangers encountered by the Texas colonists and their respect and attachment to the constitution and laws of Mexico.
All of its proceedings show that the delegates recognized the authority of the general government and in no sense were they rebellious as was claimed by a few Mexican residents of San Antonio, who refused to participate in the convention.
This convention was composed likewise of fifty-six delegates.
The main object of this convention was to prepare a constitution for Texas to be offered the government at Mexico for approval.
This constitution was framed by the following committee: Sam Houston, Chairman; Nestor Clay, R.M. Williamson, James Kerr, Oliver Jones, Luke Leassier and Henry Smith.
Stephen F. Austin, James B. Miller and Erasmo Seguin were appointed Commissioners to present the proposed constitution to the authorities at the City of Mexico and to urge its ratification.
The government refused to consider the proposed constitution but agreed to a modification of the decree prohibiting immigrants from the United Sates into Texas.
The imprisonment of Mr. Austin greatly aroused the people of Texas, and when he reached Texas he found the colonists ready for revolution.
He realized that Santa Anna was determined to bring the Texans in subjection and to ignore the constitution of 1824, which he had pledged to defend and uphold.
A quorum of delegates did not appear in San Felipe, however, until November 3rd.
This was the keynote speech and prepared the minds of the delegates for the work mapped out for them.
This convention was to be composed of delegates having plenary powers.
This convention was the fourth to be held by the colonists and because of its nature was by far the most important of them all.
â€œJust how to proceed,â€ said Mr. Pease, â€œwas the only element of doubt in the minds of some of the delegates.
There were those among the delegates who had long experience in matters of a kindred nature and they blazed the way for action.â€
On the first day of the convention [March 1, 1836], Mr. George C. Childress, introduced a resolution which was adopted without debate, providing for the appointment of a committee of five delegates to draft a declaration of independence from Mexico.
On the second day, March 2nd, Robert Potter, introduced a resolution providing for the appointment of a committee consisting of one member from each municipality represented, to prepare a constitution for the Republic of Texas.
After the adoption and signing of the Declaration of Independence, and while waiting for the report of the committee on the constitution for the Republic, the convention disposed of several important matters.
The constitution was reported on the 17th.
The convention then took up the question of establishing a government Ad Interim in conformity to the provisions of the constitution.
During the 1820s, San Felipe de Austin emerged as the capital of the Anglo colonies in Mexican Texas.
Conventions were held there in 1832 and 1833, as colonists expressed grievances and proposed ways for the Mexican government to better serve the colonies.
The Convention of 1832 (following antagonisms throughout Mexican Texas) was comprised of 55 delegates, none of whom were Tejano, representing 16 districts of Texas.
Numerous issues were addressed, including requested modifications to the Law of April 6, 1830, which had restricted general immigration from the United States.
Most controversially, delegates adopted a motion to request separate statehood from Coahuila.
William H. Wharton presided over the meeting, and the convention petitioned for repeal of the anti-immigration section of the Law of April 6, 1830.
Sam Houston chaired a committee to draft a constitution, presuming the request for separate statehood would be accepted.
In evolving forms, the government of Texas ruled from San Felipe for five months of the seven-month-long Texas Revolution.
Road to the Texas Revolution
offering an exclusive look at the Texas Revolution,
The first shots of the Texas Revolution were fired when fighting broke out at Gonzales between Mexican soldiers and Texas militiamen.
When Domingo de Ugartechea, military commander in Texas, received word that the American colonists of Gonzales refused to surrender a small cannon that had been given to that settlement in 1831 as a defense against the Indians, he dispatched Francisco de CastaÃ±eda and 100 dragoons to retrieve it on September 27.
Though CastaÃ±eda attempted to avoid conflict, on the morning of October 2 his force clashed with local Texian militia led by John Henry Moore in the first battle of the Texas Revolution.
The struggle for the "Come and Take It" cannon was only a brief skirmish that ended with the retreat of CastaÃ±eda and his force, but it also marked a clear break between the American colonists and the Mexican government.
The battle of Goliad was the second skirmish of the Texas Revolution.
The siege of Bexar (San Antonio) became the first major campaign of the Texas Revolution.
The battle of the Alamo (February 23 â€“ March 6, 1836) was a pivotal event in the Texas Revolution.

Edward VIII abdication crisis

This play on the traditional hymn references the constitutional crisis that erupted in England in 1936 when King Edward VIII decided to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice divorced American socialite.
However, Edward persisted, and abdicated his throne in December 1936 to marry the woman he loved.

In November 1936 a constitutional crisis arose when Edward wished to marry Mrs Wallis Simpson; it was felt that, as a she had already divorced her first husband and at the time Edward and Wallis had met she was still married to her second husband, she was pursuing the King because of his wealth and position and would be unacceptable as queen.

Edward VIII, who ruled the United Kingdom from January to December 1936, was born on June 23, 1894, in Richmond, London, England.
In 1936, the prince succeeded his father, George V, becoming King Edward VIII.
On December 11, 1936, he abdicated the throne in the face of opposition to his proposed marriage to Simpson, proclaiming to the public, "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love."
Edward VIII (1894-1972) became King of England after the death of his father, George V, on January 20, 1936.
On December 10, 1936, King Edward VIII submitted his abdication and it was endorsed by Parliament the next day.

King Edward VIII abdicated -- the only British monarch ever to do so voluntarily -- after less than one year on the throne in 1936 in order to marry the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Warfield Simpson, "the woman I love.”

Their vacation together aboard a yacht in the summer of 1936 was sensationally reported in the foreign press and caused considerable anxiety in British royal and governmental circles.
The crisis began in October 1936, when Wallis Simpson was granted a decree nisi—a divorce which would become final in six months—from Ernest Simpson.
A few weeks later the king told the prime minister, the staid Conservative Stanley Baldwin, that he wanted to marry Wallis Simpson and that if he could not do so and remain king, he was "prepared to go."
Finally, on December 10, 1936, after days of wild newspaper speculation about the constitutional crisis, the king abdicated.
He could not, as he said in his famous radio speech on December 11, 1936, continue to perform his duties without the support of the "woman I love," and he left the throne to his brother, who became George VI.

In 1936, King-Emperor Edward VIII abdicated the throne over his proposed marriage to a divorcee, leaving eleven-year-old Elizabeth—daughter of Edward’s brother and successor, George VI—heiress to the throne.

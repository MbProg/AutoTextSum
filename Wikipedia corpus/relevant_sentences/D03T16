Eastbourne manslaughter

Reginald Channell's father, John Henry Cancellor (1799-1860)
Reginald was just 15 years old when he was brutally beaten (as a form of corporal punishment for disobedience) by his teacher and died on the 22nd April 1860.
He was a student at Thomas Hopley's private boarding school at 22 Grand Parade, Eastbourne, at the time, and is now thought to have hycephalus (water on the brain) and some form of learning difficulty.
Hopley was tried and found guilty of Reginald's manslaughter in 1860 (the case described at the time as the Eastbourne Manslaughter) and served four years in prison, later to withdraw from public life.
What makes this discovery more shocking is that Hopley had discussed the punishment with Reginald's father John Henry Cancellor (1799-1860), a court master from Surrey, beforehand to gain his support.
bourne, for the manslaughter of Reginald Cancellor,
April 21, 1860 --- A Brutal Schoolmaster
Thomas Hopley - "a person of high attainments and irreproachable character" - operated a small school in Eastbourne for difficult children of the upper middle classes.
Reginald Cancellor was the son of a London attorney who thought his "stolid and stupid" son might benefit from the sea.
Notable people with the surname include: Damian Hopley (born 1970), English former rugby union player Hannes Hopley (born 1981), South African discus thrower Frederick John Vanderbyl Hopley, (1883-1951), South African sportsman Lizzie Hopley (also known as Elizabeth Hopley), British actress and writer Mark Hopley (born 1984), English rugby union player Thomas Hopley, a principal in the Eastbourne manslaughter, an 1860 legal case in England
1860 	Eastbourne manslaughter 	1 	Eastbourne, England 	15-year-old Reginald Cancellor died at the hands of his teacher, Thomas Hopley.
Hopley used corporal punishment with the stated intention of overcoming what he perceived as stubbornness on Cancellor's part, but instead beat the boy to death.
The case became an important legal precedent regarding the use of corporal punishment in schools.
In this paper, the writer has attempted to clarify the pedagogical stereotype that has hindered many historians of education from pointing out that corporal punishment was never abolished in the early modern history of educational thoughts.
In fact, according to the writer's perusal of the texts, the early modern educationists permitted a rod or beating as a last resort of correction, while they denounced corporal punishment.
For example, John Locke did admire the use of the "Whipping" for children's "Obstinacy" and "Stubbornness" in his famous book Some Thoughts concerning Education (1693,see §78), though he denounced corporal punishment as a "slavish" one in the same book (§52).
Locke admitted the corporal punishment as a means of discipline, for it was not outside (corporal) punishment.
Lancaster, while he condemned the corporal punishment, recommended the punishment of pillory, fetters, and "the birds in the cage".
Similarly, Mann maintained the corporal punishment as a lesser evil that cured the grave evil.
He pretended to demonstrate that corporal punishment was denied as a means of discipline as well as a means of promoting learning in the history of orthodox educational thoughts including John Locke's.
In this paper, the writer has attempted to reconsider a manslaughter case against a schoolmaster (Regina v. Hopley, 1860) by examining contemporary newspapers and educational journals.
Through this research, he intends to clarify not only the incident itself but also public reactions and opinions for/against school corporal punishment.
Regina v. Hopley had been regarded as an archetype of legal cases of school corporal punishment in commentaries on the laws of England, until the school corporal punishment was abolished in 1987.
Local newspapers enthusiastically reported the case in detail, and furthermore, submitted a profile of Hopley's career and their analyses of "The Eastbourne Tragedy" (The Brighton Observer, 11 May 1860).
Furthermore, most of English and Scotch principal newspapers also reported the trial of Hopley (July 23,1860) and made comments on the incident; The Times, The Illustrated London News, Saturday Review, The Bristol Mercury, The Manchester Guardian, The Caledonian Mercury (Edingburgh), and so on.
It is certain, as English legal textbooks told us, that Regina v. Hopley permitted a "moderate and reasonable" corporal punishment.
But on the other hand, it is more certain that the "brutal affair" stimulated popular feelings averse to corporal punishment.
For example, The Sussex Advertiser pointed out how Hopley's "miserable desire" to establish his educational system "converted correction into cruel and brutally aggravated punishment", and The Brighton Observer (May 11) demanded "the abolition of all corporal punishment in the schools of England" in order to prevent a recurrence of such tragedies.
And, above all, not only Justice Cockburn and the prosecutor Parry but also the pleader Ballantine hoped for a school without corporal punishment in the court.
On the other hand, it was only four of twelve educational periodicals published in 1860 that made comments on the Hopley case.
Most of them, except Papers for the Schoolmaster, were averse to the "public opinion" expressed vigorously in the newspapers; especially their proposal of "the total abolition of corporal punishment" (The Brighton Examiner, 31 July 1860).
In order to relieve the educational discourses from such peril and establish a professional leadership in the debate on school corporal punishment, Joseph Payne attempted to formulate a new pedagogical paradigm of school corporal punishment from a point of view of "Science and Art of Education" in his lecture (The Educational Times, March 1861).
He denied only habitual use of corporal punishment.
Rather, he asserted that "a vigilant administration", which corresponds to the "pouvoir pastoral" (Michel Foucault), was necessary for the discipline and it would become a basis for the effectiveness of corporal punishment.
However, Hopley vindicated his act as a deliberate and educational one based upon John Locke's view of corporal punishment which Payne also referred to as one of his forerunners.
Locke even approved corporal punishment against children's "Stubbornness" in his famous book Some Thoughts concerning Education (§ 78).

Jacob Middleton finds that, far from being a relic of a cruel Victorian past, corporal punishment became more frequent and institutionalised in 20th-century England.
The history of corporal punishment is important, both in itself and in what it tells us about progress and reform.
By 1890 many parents were objecting to what they saw as the cruel and arbitrary use of corporal punishment then endemic within the school system.
Yet they regularly inflicted corporal punishment on pupils, despite the threat of violence from parents or the prosecutions for assault which became an occupational hazard for teachers in the late Victorian era.
Though there is a certain amount of truth in this, it fails to acknowledge the general unpopularity of corporal punishment among parents as well as pupils.
The negative image was supported by popular literature, such as Charles Dickens’ novel Nicholas Nickleby (1838) and by real-life events, including the infamous Eastbourne Manslaughter of 1860 in which a school boy was beaten to death by his teacher.
By this date opposition to corporal punishment was at its height and it was generally believed that the demise of the practice was fast approaching.
Yet the use of corporal punishment persisted.
Meanwhile many politicians and judges educated at public schools saw corporal punishment as a normal and natural part of childhood and had little sympathy with the objections of parents.
Classroom teachers were permitted to use corporal punishment and the rights of head teachers to inflict punishment were extended considerably.
By the time of the First World War the parental protests against disciplinary excesses had been suppressed and corporal punishment was established as a normal and expected form of discipline.
However the history of corporal punishment is a reminder that reform is not a simple and linear process and that an opposition to violent excess is not a new phenomenon.
He observed that while corporal punishment was being phased out of the judicial system, it was being retained and tolerated within schools.

Two sides to corporal punishment practices in Japan
The December suicide of an Osaka high school basketball team captain who had been physically punished by his coach cast a harsh light on corporal punishment in Japan, and this week’s admission by the All Japan Judo Federation that Olympic female judoka had been physically abused and harassed by their head coach served to underscore just how widespread the practice is.

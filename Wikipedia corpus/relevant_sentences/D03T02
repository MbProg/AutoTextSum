Afroyim v Rusk

Afroyim v. Rusk presented a challenge to the same statute Frankfurter had upheld, but this time the challenger was a respectable artist from New York who had, perhaps naively, voted in an Israeli election.
Beys Afroyim immigrated from Poland to the United States in 1912 and became a naturalized citizen some years later.
Plaintiff, who was born in Poland in 1893, emigrated to the United States in 1912.
Plaintiff under the name of Ephraim Bernstein, also known as Beys Afroyim, became a naturalized citizen by order of this Court on June 14, 1926.
In Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 (1967) and Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U.S. 252 (1980), the Supreme Court ruled that expatriation requires the voluntary commission of an expatriating act with the intention or assent of the citizen to relinquish citizenship.
The Court also said that the language of the Constitution and the legislative history of earlier citizenship laws strongly indicated that Congress never had the power to revoke citizenship.
Afroyim, born in Poland, was naturalized as an American citizen in 1926.
Summary of Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 87 S. Ct. 1660, 18 L. Ed.
Afroyim (P) was born in Poland and became a United States citizen in 1926.
He also asserted that the Constitution does not grant Congress the express power to revoke citizenship once it has been acquired, and that citizenship can only be lost through voluntary renunciation in light of Section 1 Clause 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The district court held that Congress has the authority to revoke citizenship by voting in a foreign election by virtue of its implied power to regulate foreign relations.
The Supreme Court overruled it nine years later in Afroyim v. Rusk.
The plaintiff, Sophie Anna Peter, was born in Poland in 1906 and at the age of eight immigrated to the United States with her parents.
In Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 87 S. Ct. 1660, 18 L. Ed.
She challenges the constitutionality of the section relied upon, and as applied in her case, invoking, inter alia, the right of citizenship guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the First Amendment protections securing freedom of speech and the press.
Afroyim v. Rusk
United States Supreme Court
387 U.S. 253 (1967)
Afroyim (plaintiff) was born in Poland in 1893, immigrated to the United States in 1912, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1926.
Afroyim filed a declaratory judgment action against Rusk (defendant), the Secretary of State, in federal district court alleging that the Act violates the Fourteenth Amendment in that Congress does not have the power to revoke citizenship once acquired, and the only way one can lose citizenship is by voluntarily renouncing it.
The court of appeals agreed with the district court’s rejection of Afroyim’s arguments, holding that under Congress’ implied power to regulate foreign affairs, Congress has authority to revoke citizenship for voting in a foreign country.
Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 (1967), was a United States Supreme Court decision that set an important legal precedent that a person born or naturalized in the United States cannot be deprived of his or her citizenship involuntarily.
In so doing, the Supreme Court overruled one of its own precedents, Perez v. Brownell (1958), in which the Court had upheld loss of citizenship under similar circumstances.

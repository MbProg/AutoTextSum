Bal des Ardents

It appears at the beginning of a chapter in which Froissart relates a disaster commonly referred to as the "Bal des Ardents," or "Dance of the Burning Men" [3]
<3> During a 1393 celebration at the Hôtel de Saint-Pol for the wedding of a knight and one of the French queen's ladies-in-waiting, Charles VI, then king of France, decided that he and five of his closest noble friends would dress up as "wild men," donning elaborate costumes made of linen and pitch, and then dance, incognito, for the delight of those gathered for the wedding.
Unfortunately, when Louis, Duke of Orleans and brother to the king, approached the dancers while holding a torch, an errant spark caught on one of the dancer's costumes.
Due to the dryness of the linen hair-suits and the close proximity of the dancers, this fire rapidly spread to five chained dancers.
The Duchess of Berry, the king's aunt, had identified her nephew earlier in the dance, and so quickly wrapped him up in her robe to protect him form the fire; the son of the Lord of Nantouillet rushed into the wine cellar to immerse himself in a large vat of water.
These two were only survivors: the four other dancers died "in great pain and suffering" (Froissart 4: 178; ch.
According to Froissart, the news of these events quickly spread through city, shocking the Parisians with the tragic consequences of the king's decadence.
Charles VI, wrapped in the Duchess of Berry's blue robe and attended to by a man in a black gown, watches the other dancers, in wide-eyed shock.
A few figures peer out from underneath the viewing stand, while a noble holding a torch rushes toward the dance floor.
The burning dancers are at the center of this swirl of onlookers, chained together and woven into an agonized thicket of contorted poses.
Almost all the surrounding figures in this scene turn their attention to the dancers; this central group glares out at the manuscript's viewer, as if the pupil of some giant eye.
2646, contact the BNF for permission to see it, and then jet over to Paris.
As part of the article's larger discussion of the manuscript copies of Book 4 of the Chroniques, the authors compare different renditions of the one event that is universally illustrated across the different manuscripts: the Bal des Ardents.
Harf-Lancner and Le Guay identify the image of the Bal des Ardents as one of a class of "dramatic scenes" that occur in the various Book Four manuscripts, scenes "in which blossom a 'macabre' aesthetic characteristic of the fifteenth century" (102) [7].
2646's miniature of the Bal des Ardents are symptoms of the conditions surrounding the manuscript's creation.
The hair-suits worn by the dancers are the most carefully described garments in this chapter: the equerry "acquired six canvas tunics, […] had frayed linen brought forth and strewn over them, and covered the tunics with frayed linen in the form and color of hair" (4: 177; ch.
It was this general kind of explanation that hovered over and around me as I looked at this image of the Bal des Ardents, increasingly fascinated by the green shoe lurking in the background and striving to attribute some specific meaning to it.
2646's image of the Bal des Ardents, at least in terms of the descriptive details supplied within the text.
<39> The miniature of the Bal des Ardents is filled with elements that point beyond this manuscript, elements that call out to the viewer's personal experience or imaginative expansion, and, as a result, emphasizes the image's superior capacity to engage these different qualities.
2646's image of the Bal des Ardents offer the same opportunity for imaginative expansion, a way to evoke and implicate the viewer's reality without having to represent this reality directly or completely.
This apparent attachment might be its own form of avoidance.
Here is the account from Paris Kiosque:
Be that as it may, in all likelihood the manor belonged to the royal family and was the site of the tragic scene of the Bal des Ardents, a fancy-dress ball held here on 28 January 1393.
One of the most famous, the Bal des Ardents, or “Ball of the Burning Men,” was held in in Paris in 1393 by the then Queen of France, Isabeau of Bavaria.
Six members of the nobility, including her husband King Charles VI, performed a dance while in costume as “savage men.”
Unfortunately, their shaggy costumes were wildly flammable, and when the king’s drunken brother leaned a torch over to try to see the identity of a dancer, an errant spark lit the man’s costume on fire and the flames quickly spread to the other dancers.
Only two survived: one of the dancers saved himself by jumping into a vat of wine, and another—King Charles himself—was sheltered by his young aunt Joan, the Duchess of Berry, who threw her skirts over him to shield him from sparks.
Although masquerades tapered off somewhat after the 18th century, some notable masquerade balls were held in the 20th century, including Carlos de Beistegui’s Le Bal Oriental in Venice in 1951, and Truman Capote’s Black And White Ball in New York in 1966 (lots more on that one here).
In 1889, Tiffany & Co. brought the Paris Exposition to its knees with a display of 24 brooches in the shape of jeweled orchids.
The flowers were created by Tiffany’s genius designer Paulding Farnham, and, according to John Loring’s book Tiffany Jewels, they were “universally acclaimed as the most original and finest jewels at the Paris Exposition,” and earned both Farnham and Tiffany & Co. the grand prize gold medal for jewelry.
Farnham went on to produce more acclaimed collections, many incorporating Native American, Asian or Aztec motifs, and his designs again won Tiffany the grand prize for jewelry at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900.
Made of silver wire and cord, its simple spiral design was influenced by the Bronze Age artifacts and African sculpture that Calder saw at local museums while he lived in Paris.
The torch Orleans carried sparked onto one of the dancer's clothing and four of them burned to death.
This became known as the Bal des Ardents.
A chronicler claimed Orleans was guilty of attempted regicide, and was a wizard, besides.
Oh, and shortly after the Bal des Ardents, Charles kicked the Jews out of France, giving them time to liquidate their belongings and pay up their debts.
When she supported the Burgundians, the Armagnacs imprisoned her in Paris.
On This Day In History in 1393, Charles VI of France is almost killed, accidentally on purpose, by several masked dancers, who happened to be on fire.
The King of France was attending a masquerade ball, The Bal des Ardents, which translates as "The Ball of the Burning Men", which we hope was name after the event.
Charles VI was known for his awesome dance moves.
The King of France, never wanting to miss an opportunity, decided to get up and dance.
Well, for starters, you can bring a torch into a packed area and set a few dancers on fire, hoping that fire would spread like, well, fire, and hope the king goes up like a roman candle.
Although four of the dancers were killed, King Charles VI survived the ordeal.
The "Bal des Ardents" ("Burning Men's Ball") was held by Charles VI of France, and intended as a Bal des sauvages ("Wild Men's Ball"), a form of costumed ball (morisco).
It took place in celebration of the marriage of a lady-in-waiting of Charles VI of France's queen in Paris on January 28, 1393.
When they came too close to a torch, the dancers caught fire.
Such costumed dances were a special luxury of the ducal court of Burgundy.
They were generally elaborate dances held for members of the upper classes, and were particularly popular in Venice.
Special Feature: Le Bal des Ardents Bookstore
I wonder why this bookstore is called Le Bal des Ardents, which means "the dance of the burning ones", since the gruesome story behind the name has nothing to do with books: Le Bal des Ardents, aka the Dance of the Savages, was a masquerade ball held in 1393 in France at which dancers impersonating savages and dressed in highly flammable costumes caught fire from a torch the king's brother carelessly brought in; the king was one of the dancers (don't tell me the brother was just trying to figure out who the masked dancers were) and only he and one other dancer survived.
Le Bal Des Ardents is a mini-LP reissue of a strange cassette based on the terrifying historical event about the French King Charles VI the day of January 28th 1393, where he escaped from a fire caused by a torch during a masked ball, a tragedy who will let him sink into madness soon after.
The miniature shows a horrible event which took place on 28 January 1393 in Paris.
A ball was held in Hôtel de Saint-Pol to honor the wedding of a knight and Catherine de Fastaverin, one of the ladies-in-waiting of Isabeau of Bavaria, Queen consort of France and wife of King Charles VI of France.
At the suggestion of Huguet de Guisay, a special dance was performed by King Charles VI of France and 5 friends.
The 6 men were dressed as 'wild men' in costumes of linen soaked with resin to which flax was attached "so that they appeared shaggy and hairy from head to foot", including masks which covered the faces of the dancers so that they would dance incognito (the audience did not know the king was among the group).
Unfortunately, the drunk Louis, Duke of Orleans and brother to the king, approached the dancers to check the identity while holding a torch and an errant spark caught on one of the dancer's costumes.
The entire scene quickly descended into chaos as the fire spread to the other dancers.
Ogier de Nantouillet, one of the dancers, saved himself when he jumped into a wine vat.
Charles VI was saved by quick thinking of his aunt Joan II, Countess of Auvergne and Boulogne, who swiftly threw her voluminous skirt over him (she had identified her nephew during the dance) - this can be seen in the miniature.
The other 4 dancers (Count de Joigny, Yvain de Foix, Aimery Poitiers and Huguet de Guisay) all died because of their wounds.
Louis, Duke of Orléans, was blamed for the tragedy (one source even accused him of trying to murder the king) and donated funds in atonement for a chapel to be built at the Celestine monastery.
The status of Charles VI, already suffering from attacks of illness, insanity (at one moment he thought he was made of glass) and a declining health, suffered greatly because of this incident as the population of Paris saw the dance as a symbol of their decadence and soon lost all political power.
But one joke performance went tragically awry in 1394 Paris.
It became known thereafter as the bals des ardents, the Ball of the Burning Men.
For Bronson van Wyckâ€™s 40th birthday party, an epic and decadent Bal des Sauvages, guests arrived in fine featherâ€”literally.There wasnâ€™t a bird left standing on the East Coast since most of the feathers were on the heads of the women in attendance.
And trust me, after receiving the save-the-date (on cardstock thicker than a Katzâ€™s sandwich), the invitation, and the link to the elaborate website (which outlined the history of Bal des Sauvages and offered extensive costume suggestions), expectations were high.
Van Wyck and his team transformed an underground concrete bunker on West 27th Street into a rich warren of lushly furnished rooms decorated to a T. Around 11 p.m., van Wyck performed a Madonna-inspired dance routine in a Lacroix coutureâ€“inspired ensemble.
What was the 'Ball of the Burning Men'?
On 28 January 1393, a masquerade ball was held at the French royal court to celebrate the marriage of one of the Queenâ€™s ladies-in-waiting.
The young King Charles VI and five of his noble companions performed a dance as â€˜wild menâ€™, disguised in masks and shaggy costumes made from linen and resin.
One account describes how he then â€˜threwâ€™ the torch at the dancers, but others suggest he simply came too close to them while trying to guess their identities.
Whatever the case, the dancersâ€™ highly flammable costumes soon became engulfed in flames.
Another dancer leapt into a vat of wine.
The tragedy shook public confidence in the monarchy - destroying the reputation of the Duke of Orleans, in particular - and became known as the â€˜Bal des Ardentsâ€™, or the â€˜Ball of the Burning Menâ€™.
January 28th 1393: Bal des Ardents
On this day in 1393, the French King Charles VI was almost killed at a masquerade ball when the dancers caught fire; the event has since become known as the ‘Bal des Ardents’ or ‘The Ball of the Burning Men’.
The fire broke out because of a flame torch, and killed four of the dancers.
This incident did not help his reputation  as it seemed emblematic of the decadence of Charles’s court.

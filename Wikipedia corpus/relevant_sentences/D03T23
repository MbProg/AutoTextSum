Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India

Fundamental Rights and Duties of Indian
The Constitution of India is Fedral in nature.
Fundamental Duties To abide by the Constitution and respect the National Flag and the National Anthem; To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom; To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;
The Constituent Assembly of India met in the Constitution Hall, New Delhi, at Ten of the Clock Mr. Vice-President (Dr. H. C. Mookherjee) in the Chair.
I would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Members to what Dr. Ambedkar has said in his own book, that these principles should be embodied in the Constitution as Fundamental Rights and that a scheme embodying these principles should be brought into operation within ten years.
Sir, I move my amendment, and reading my amendment with Mr. Kamath's amendment, it should be "Fundamental Rights".
'We' means the Advisory Committee on the subject of Fundamental Rights.
"We have come to the conclusion that in addition to these Fundamental Rights, the Constitution should include certain directives of state policy which though not cognizable in any court of law, should be regarded as fundamental in the governance of the country."
But to classify them asFundamental Rights as in Part III would be to take away thedifference between the one set and the other, and making allthe rights justiciable, which, in the nature of things, is impossible.
I have also given notice of an amendment which is No. 861 in the printed list and which says that "After a period of ten years, these directive principles of State Policy shall become the Fundamental Rights of the People and shall be enforceable by any Court".
If all those rights that are embodied here are so fundamental they must be transferred to the Chapter of Fundamental Rights.
I consider the Directve Pirnciples of the Fundamental Rights in the Constitution as the Sermon on the Mount.
Therefore nothing will be gained by putting all and sundry in the Fundamental Rights.
As was pointed out by the previous speaker, if we have got any real reverence for the views of Gandhiji, we ought to incorporate prohibition at least in the directive principles, if not in the mandatory provisions of the Fundamental Rights.

A Critical Study of the Fundamental Duties under the Constitution of India as Legally Enforceable Duties under Different Statutes
Fundamental Duties of the citizens of India mentioned in Article 51A of the Indian Constitution.
By the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution, adopted in 1976, Fundamental Duties of the citizens have also been enumerated.
The concept of Fundamental Duties was taken from the constitution of USSR along with the concept of Five Year Plan.
The Fundamental Rights in Part III, the Directive Principles of State Policy in Part IV and the Fundamental Duties in Part IVA forms a compendium and have to be read together.
It is true that there is no legal sanction provided for violation or non-performance of Fundamental Duties.
However, Fundamental Duties have an inherent element of compulsion regarding compliance.
Clauses (b), (d), (f), (h) and (j) require the citizens to perform these Fundamental Duties actively.
It is said that by their nature, it is not practicable to enforce the Fundamental Duties and they must be left to the will and aspiration of the citizens.
However, in the case of citizens holding public office, each and all Fundamental Duties can be enforced by suitable legislation and departmental rules of conduct.
In AIIMS Students Union v. AIIMS, speaking about the importance of Fundamental Duties enriched in Article 51-A while striking down the institutional reservation of 33% in AIIMS coupled with 50% reservation discipline wise as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court said that they are equally important like fundamental rights.
The Constitution of India came into force on 26 January 1950.
Fundamental Duties of the citizens of India mentioned in Article 51A of the Indian Constitution.
By the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution, adopted in 1976, Fundamental Duties of the citizens have also been enumerated.

By the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution, adopted in 1976, Fundamental Duties of the citizens have also been enumerated.
Following are the Fundamental Duties under the Constitution of India which is given in Part IV-A of the Constitution of India which was inserted by the (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976.
The concept of Fundamental Duties was taken from the constitution of USSR along with the concept of Five Year Plan.
Enforceability of Fundamental Duties
of course, the duties as such are not legally enforceable in the Courts of law, but if a law has been made to prohibit any act or conduct in violation of the duties, it would be reasonable restriction on the relevant Fundamental Rights.
—Since the Fundamental Duties are not addressed to the State, a citizen cannot claim that he must be properly equipped by the state so that he may perform his duties under Article 51-A.
The Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties are sections of the Constitution of India that prescribe the fundamental obligations of the State to its citizens and the duties of the citizens to the State.
The Fundamental Duties are defined as the moral obligations of all citizens to help promote a spirit of patriotism and to uphold the unity of India.
The Fundamental Duties are however, not legally enforceable, i.e. without any legal sanction in case of their violation or non-compliance.

Mr. Mishra, learned amicus curiae, would submit that there is no reason as to why the burden of the State should be shifted to the Union of India and having regard to the provisions of Articles 21 and 23 of the Constitution of India, this Court is entitled to pierce the corporate veil of the Government companies which are 'States' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India.
Mr. Mishra would urge that as indisputably the corporations owned and controlled by the State of Bihar are 'State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India, neither they nor the State of Bihar can escape their liability from enforcing the rights of the citizens of India under Articles 21 and 23 of the Constitution of India.
Mr. Mishra would submit that the Full Bench of the Patna High Court has referred to certain decisions of this Court which did not deal with an issue of this nature nor it took notice of different facets of Article 21 of the Constitution of India which would include a right to food, shelter and other basic amenities.
Non-payment of lawful salary to the employees, Mr. Mishra would submit, would fall within the definition of 'forced labour' which is prohibited by Article 23 of the Constitution of India.
Ms. Hingorani would contend that the Government companies or corporations will have to discharge their constitutional obligations in terms of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
Whether in a case of this nature, the Court would take a sheer legalistic approach in holding that the corporate veil would not be lifted although its conscience stands satisfied that there has been violations of citizens' right to life and liberty as adumbrated under Article 21 of the Constitution of India?
Whether having regard to the admitted position that the Government Companies or Corporations referred to hereinbefore are States within the meaning of Article 12 of the ( onstitution of India, the State of Bihar having deep and pervasive control over the affairs thereof can be held to be liable to render all assistance to the said companies so as to fulfill its own and/or the corporations' obligations to comply with the citizens ' right under Articles 21 and 23 of the Constitution of India?
We are not oblivious of the legal proposition as enunciated in Ramana Dayaram Shetty and SAIL (supra) that even if a Government company is a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India as an agency or instrumentality of the State, there does not exist a relationship of principal or an agent and only the action of the said authorities would be State action.
The Government companies/public sector undertakings being 'State' would be constitutionally liable to respect life and liberty of all persons in terms of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
Such welfare activities as adumbrated in Part IV of the Constitution of India indisputably would cast a duty upon the State being a welfare State and its statutory authorities to do all things which they are statutorily obligated to perform.
"Whatever else it may also be, a country's written constitutional bill of rights is a high-ranking regulatory law, a "statute" fraught with direct legal consequences.
The power of the State in the sphere of exercise of its constitutional power including those contained in Article 298 of the Constitution of India inheres in it a duty towards public, whose money is being invested Article 298 of the Constitution of India confers a prerogative upon the State to carry on trade or business While so the State must fulfil its constitutional obligations.
It must oversee protection and preservation of the rights as adumbrated in Articles 14, 19, 21 and 300-A of the Constitution of India.
If it is considered to be the duty of the citizen to remind himself of the aspirations of the Constitution makers, the State, in our opinion, cannot be permitted to say that it has no such duty towards its own citizens Clauses (a)(b) and (e) of Article 51-A of the Constitution of India read as under:
Parts III and IV of the Constitution of India contain a large number of rights which guarantee human rights, some of which are akin to the rights enumerated in International Treaties and Chapters.
In a democratic society as a member of the organized civic community one should have permanent shelter so as to physically, mentally and intellectually equip oneself to improve his excellence as a useful citizen as enjoined in the Fundamental Duties and to be a useful citizen and equal participant in democracy.
The term 'life' used in Article 21 of the Constitution of India has a wide and far reaching concept.
In no uncertain terms, this Court held that exaction of labour and services against payment of less than the minimum wages amounts to forced labour within the meaning of Article 23 of the Constitution of India.
Explaining the rights of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, this Court in S.M.D. Kiran Pasha v. Government of Andhra Pradesh and Ors., [1990] 1 SCC 328 observed that Article 226 of the Constitution of India would be maintainable also when a right is threatened as contra distinguished from the right when infringed.
It is also well-settled that interpretation of the Constitution of India or statutes would change from time to time.
They having regard to the constitutional provisions adumbrated in the Constitution of India and in particular Part IV thereof laying down the Directive Principles of the State Policy and Part IVA laying down the Fundamental Duties are bound to preserve the practice to maintain the human dignity.
The Fundamental Rights are defined as the basic human rights of all citizens.
The Directive Principles of State Policy are guidelines for the framing of laws by the government.
Concept of Fundamental Rights- Their Origin & Development
The political and Civil rights which were in opinion, with the reach of the individual were provisional as fundamental rights and the latter being considered beyond individual’s reach under the prevailing circumstances, were titled as Directive Principles of State Policy.
Fundamental Rights
The judicial attitude has undergone transformation where courts are very active to uphold the fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution thereby interpreting the provisions of part-IV i.e. Directive Principles of State Policy.
Further, the constitution of India prescribes the fundamental obligations of State to its citizens and duties of citizens towards State in the form of Fundamental Rights, Directive principles and Fundamental Duties as various sections of the constitution.
The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human rights of the citizen.
Recommendation 1: Legal enforcement of Fundamental Duties
The Constitution of India recites that "… the people of India …, do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves, this Constitution".
However, first, for comparative purposes some brief reference to the Constitution of India is necessary.
The shape of the Constitution of India
30 The Preamble of the Constitution of India contains an important statement about the source of the legal authority of the Constitution and its objectives:
37 Part IV sets out what are called "Directive Principles of State Policy" in the nature of social and economic objectives.
39 There are many differences between the Constitution of India and that of Australia.
It would improvement government policy-making and administrative decision-making.
58 In summary, unlike the Constitution of India, Australia's Constitution contains no express protection for freedom of speech or expression.

Which among the following does not come under Fundamental Duties of a citizen in India?
(A)National Integration (B)Economic Equality (C)Fundamental Rights 14.
Which part of the Indian Constitution enshrines Fundamental Duties?
The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are contained in part IV, articles 36 to 50, of the Indian Constitution.
Fundamental Rights versus DPSP
5 Later, in the Fundamental Rights Case (referred to above), the majority opinions reflected the view that what is fundamental in the governance of the country cannot be less significant than what is significant in the life of the individual.
Even though the above directive principle may not be enforceable as such by virtue of Article 37 of the Constitution of India, it may be relied upon by the petitioners to show that in the instant case they have been subjected to hostile discrimination.
The right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy and particularly clauses (e) and (f) of Article 39 and Article 41 and 42 and at the least, therefore, it must include protection of the health and strength of workers, men and women, and of the tender age of chil­dren against abuse, opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity, educational facilities, just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief.
Since the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in clauses (e) and (f) of Article 39, Articles 41 and 42 are not enforceable in a court of law, it may not be possible to compel the State through the judicial process to make provision by statutory enactment or executive fiat for ensuring these basic essentials which go to make up a life of human dignity, but where legislation is already enacted by the State providing these basic requirements to the workmen and thus investing their right to live with basic human dignity, with concrete reality and content, the State can certainly be obligated to ensure observance of such legislation, for inaction on the part of the State in securing implementation of such legislation would amount to denial of the right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article 21, more so in the context of Article 256 which provides that the executive power of every State shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that State.21

In fact the Fundamental Rights case concerned the constitutional validity of article 31C of the Constitution.
C. Fundamental Rights
E. Fundamental Duties
The vision of our founding fathers and the aims and objectives which they wanted to achieve through the Constitution are contained in the Preamble, the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles.
These three may be described as the soul of the Constitution and the testament of the founding fathers to the succeeding generations together with the later Part on Fundamental Duties.
3.3.1        The scheme of the Constitution for the realisation of the socio-economic agenda comprises of both the justiciable Fundamental Rights as well as the non-justiciable Directive Principles.
The judicial contribution to the synthesis and the integration of the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles in the process of "constitutionalising" social and economic rights has been crucial to the realisation of the Directive Principles not only as a means to effectuate Fundamental Rights but also as a source of laws for a welfare state.
C. Fundamental Rights
By the year 1949, when the Constituent Assembly had completed the drafting of the Fundamental Rights Chapter, it had before it the ‘Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948.
The Directive Principles of State Policy in Part IV of the Constitution are indeed the precursor to economic, social and cultural rights specified in the ICESCR.
The Supreme Court has also held that the scope of certain fundamental rights could be adjudged by reading into them or reading them not only in the light of the Directive Principles of State Policy but also international covenants or conventions which were in harmony with the Fundamental Rights.
3.4.5   The Commission feels that after fifty years, time is ripe to review and enlarge suitably the contents of some of the Fundamental Rights, particularly those Fundamental Rights which have been judicially deduced.
[1] on ‘Enlargement of Fundamental Rights’, it was proposed that article 31B be suitably amended to provide that the laws to be included in the Ninth Schedule must, in pith and substance, relate to agrarian reforms or land reforms or laws to give effect to the directive principles in article 39(b) and 39(c).
3.25.5  The comparable provisions of the Directive Principles of State Policy enshrined in the Constitution of India and the ICESCR are given below :-
For ensuring that the Directive Principles of State Policy are realized more effectively, the following procedure is suggested:-
(i)           The Planning Commission shall ensure that there is special mention/emphasis in all the plans and schemes formulated by it, on the effectuation/realization of the Directive Principles of State Policy.
(ii)         Every Ministry/Department of the Government of India shall make a special annual report indicating the extent of effectuation/realization of the Directive Principles of State Policy, the shortfall in the targets, the reasons for the shortfall, if any, and the remedial measures taken to ensure their full realization, during the year under report.
E. Fundamental Duties
3.37.1  Ten Fundamental Duties of the citizen are incorporated in article 51A, Part IVA of the Constitution.
3.37.2  Constitutions of some countries of the world contain provisions for Fundamental Duties.
The inclusion of Fundamental Duties in our Constitution also brings it in line with Article 29(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which says:  “Everyone has the duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of the personality is possible.”
3.37.3    In the last quarter-century since the Amendment, several judgments of High Courts and the Supreme Court have quoted these Fundamental Duties, where applicable, to lend further support to their decisions.
3.37.4  A consultation paper on the subject of “Effectuation of Fundamental Duties” prepared for the Commission by the Citizenship Development Society was circulated for eliciting public opinion.
Responses received were carefully examined by the Commission along with the report of the Justice Verma Committee on Fundamental Duties.
3.37.5  The Government of India appointed the committee “to operationalise the suggestions to teach Fundamental Duties to the citizens of India” in the year 1998 under the chairmanship of Justice J.S. Verma.
[1] to the Consultation Paper on “Effectuation of Fundamental Duties of Citizens”.
3.38.1  Fundamental Duties of citizens serve a useful purpose.
In sum, the Commission believes that article 51A has travelled a great distance since it was introduced in the Forty-second Amendment and further consideration should be given to ways and means to popularise the knowledge and content of the Fundamental Duties and effectuate them.
Consideration should be given to the ways and means by which Fundamental Duties could be popularized and made effective; (ii) right to freedom of religion and other freedoms must be jealously guarded and rights of minorities and fellow citizens respected;  (iii) reform of the whole process of education is an immediate but immense need, as is the need to free it from governmental or political control; it is only through education that will power to adhere to our Fundamental Duties as citizens can be inculcated; and (iv) duty to vote at elections, actively participate in the democratic process of governance and to pay taxes should be included in article 51A.
The Commission fully endorses the other recommendations of the Justice Verma Committee on operationalisation of Fundamental Duties of Citizens and strongly suggests their early implementation.

The Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties are sections of the Constitution of India that prescribe the fundamental obligations of the State to its citizens and the duties of the citizens to the State.These sections comprise a constitutional bill of rights for government policy-making and the behaviour and conduct of citizens.
These sections are considered vital elements of the constitution, which was developed between 1947 and 1949 by the Constituent Assembly of India.
Hon'ble Justice J. S. Verma, Former Chief Justice of Supreme Court of India inaugurated the lecture, which highlighted the Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties.
These are vital elements of the Constitution of India that prescribe the fundamental obligations of the State towards its citizens as well as the duties of the citizens to the State, Hon'ble Justice Verma said, adding that these not only guide Government policy making, but also regulate the behaviour and conduct of citizens.
The Fundamental Rights, defined in Part III of the Constitution, guarantees the basic human rights to all citizens.
Similarly, the Fundamental Duties are defined as the moral obligations of all citizens to help promote the spirit of patriotism and to uphold the unity of India.
Difference between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy
Parts III and IV, that is, chapters on Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, together constitute the “conscience” of the Indian constitution.
But, the differences between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State policy are significant.
As Gladhill observes, Fundamental Rights are injunctions to prohibit the government from doing certain things, the Directive principles are affirmative instructions to the government to do certain things.
In 1951, in Champakam Dorairajan vs. the state of Madras, the Supreme Court held “The chapter on Fundamental Rights is sacrosanct and not liable to be abridged by any legislative or executive act.
The Directive Principles of State Policy have to conform and are subsidiary to the chapter on Fundamental Rights.”
The Fundamental Rights, embodied in Part III of the Constitution, guarantee civil rights to all Indians, and prevent the State from encroaching on individual liberty while simultaneously placing upon it an obligation to protect the citizens' rights from encroachment by society.
Fundamental Rights
Fundamental Duties
The Fundamental Duties of citizens were added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year.
Originally ten in number, the Fundamental Duties were increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002, which added a duty on every parent or guardian to ensure that their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years.
The other Fundamental Duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India, including the Constitution, to cherish its heritage, preserve its composite culture and assist in its defence.
The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles had their origins in the Indian independence movement, which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social welfare as the goals of an independent Indian state.
Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India
Conflict between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy March 10, 2013
The Fundamental Rights are the rights of the individual citizens guaranteed by the Constitution.
Champakam Dorairajan Case This conflict between Fundamental Rights and DPSP came to the Supreme Court for the first time in Champakam Dorairajan Case (1952).
The conflict was between article 16(2) from the chapter of Fundamental Rights and Article 46 of the Constitution.
Supreme Court mandated that the chapter on Fundamental rights in the constitution is sacrosanct and the directive principles have to conform to and run subsidiary to the chapter on Fundamental Rights.
This means that Fundamental Rights were given superiority over the Directive principles.
The court in this case laid down that Fundamental Rights cannot be abridged/ diluted to implement the directive principles.
This amendment made it clear that Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution including Fundamental Rights and the word ‘law’ as used in Article 13 does not include a Constitutional Amendment Act.
Kesavanand Bharti Case In the Kesavananda Bharti Case the Supreme Court ruled that Parliament could amend any and every part of the Constitution including Fundamental Rights but it could not destroy the basic structure of the Constitution.
Minerva Mills Case The parliament by 42nd amendment further widened the scope of the Fundamental Rights.
Summary of Conflict between Fundamental Rights and DPSP A member in the constituent assembly moved an amendment which sought to make the directive principles justifiable.
It was a view of Jawahar Lal Nehru that where there was a conflict between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles the DPSP should prevail.
However, where we look into the Judicial ‘nature’ of the above two, we see that Supreme Court should upheld the Fundamental Rights because they are guaranteed by the Constitution and justifiable.
When a social conflict arises out of the conflicts of the Fundamental Rights and DPSP, the state should emerge as a “Torch bearer” because ultimately it is the superiority of the “Social Interest” over the “individual interest’.
After the Minerva Mills Case, The supreme court to the view that there is no conflict between the Fundamental Rights and the DPSP and they were complimentary of each other.
Constitution of India
Fundamental Duties
Fundamental Rights
Preamble to the Constitution of India
The Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949, and came into effect on 26 January 1950.
The constitution also plays a central role in defining the duties of the citizens of the country under Article 51A known as “Fundamental Duties”.
Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles
Since both the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles were of common origin, it is clear that they both had the same objectives, namely to ensure the goal of a welfare society envisaged by the Preamble.
The preamble, the Directive Principles and the Fundamental Rights constitute the more important features of our Constitution.
The Directive Principals of the State Policy enshrined in Part IV and the Fundamental Rights, guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution.
Although Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles appear in the Constitution as district entities, it was the Assembly that separate them; the leaders of the freedom struggle had drawn no distinction between the positive and negative obligations of the states.
The researcher, through this paper attempts to examine and explore the inter-relationship between Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles, enshrined in Part III and Part IV of the Constitution respectively.
The first part of the paper will focus on the origin of the concept of Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights, and trace as to how inspite of them having a common origin, they were separated.
What is the relationship between Fundamental rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, with respect to what has been discussed by the framers of the Constitution and also how it has been developed by the judiciary?
Although, the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy (hereinafter DPSPs) appear in the Constitution distinct entities, historically both had a common origin.
The first explicit demand for the fundamental rights was made in the Constitution of India Bill, 1985.
The objective of guaranteeing certain undeniable rights or irrevocable rights against oppression was at the back of the resolution of Madras Congress in 1927 which provided setting up of a committee to draft ‘a Swaraj Constitution of India’ on the basis of Declaration of Rights and the Nehru Report, produced by the Committees headed by Motilal Nehru, in 1928.
A genesis of many provisions which has been included under Directive Principles in the Constitution of 1949, found its place in the Nehru Report, under the heading of Fundamental Rights.
The inclusion of non-justiciable rights in the sub-committee on Fundamental Rights was met with mixed reactions, some being pessimistic, while others optimistic.
The enumeration of the fundamental rights and the non-justiciable directives was also performed by Sir B.N. Rau, in his draft of Fundamental Rights, presented by him in the Fundamental Rights Sub-Committee, which was appointed by the Constitution.
He therefore divided the rights in the draft into two groups- Group A and Group B. Group B included the Fundamental Rights which were to be “enforced by legal action”.
In the Draft Constitution, the fundamental rights were included in Part III, which consisted of Articles 7-27, while the non-justiciable rights were placed under Part IV, with the heading Directive Principles of State Policy, which consisted of Articles 28-40.
The Drafting Committee and the Constituent Assembly did not accept the amendment proposed by Sir B.N. Rau which would have given primacy to laws made to implement Directive Principles, which conflicted with one or more Fundamental Rights.
The question of relationship between Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights has caused come difficulty and the judicial attitude has undergone a change over time.
Conflict Between Fundamental Rights And Directive Principles
Since the Directive Principles lay wide objectives of the State which cannot be legally enforced, while the Fundamental Rights are judicially enforceable, the question as to what happens if one is inconsistent with another, or one is in contravention of another naturally arises.
According to the court, since Fundamental Rights were enforceable and the directive Principles were not, the laws to implement Directive Principles could not take away Fundamental Rights.
The Directive Principles should run subsidiary and conform to the Fundamental Rights.
This made it clear that Directive Principles were no less important than Fundamental Rights, However, despite the amendment courts did not give much importance to the Directive Principles.
Though the judiciary continued to hold that the Directives were subordinate to the Fundamental Rights, an attempt was made to achieve the ideals mentioned Directive Principles.
The Supreme Court’s view regarding the interplay of Directive principles and Fundamental Rights underwent a change.
Applying this doctrine, the Supreme Court came to adopt the view that in determining the ambit the ambit of Fundamental Rights themselves, the court might look at relevant Directive Principles.
[8] However it must be noted that the earliest formulation of the doctrine of harmonious construction, the court looked at the problem form the other end, namely reading the Directives as being limited by the Fundamental Rights.
However, Das C.J., was said that the courts must not entirely ignore the Directive Principles and the principle of harmonious construction should be adopted to give effect to both Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles as much as possible.
Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are co-equal:
A change in the judicial attitude can be perceived in Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan [12] , where Mudholkar J., said that even if the fundamental Rights were taken as unchangeable, the much needed dynamism may be achieved by properly interpreting the Fundamental Rights in the light of Directive Principles.
In Bijoya Cotton Mills v. State of West Bengal [13] , the Apex Court laid down two rules of construction-one, in case of a conflict between the right of the individual and the laws aiming to implement socio-economic policies, in pursuance to Directive Principles, weight should be given to the latter, and two- every legislation enacted in pursuance of Directive Principles should be construed as one purporting to be in public interest, or as a reasonable restriction to the Fundamental Rights.
In Golak Nath v. State of Punjab [14] , the same principle was applied by Justice Subba Rao, and it was emphasized that the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles form an ‘integrated scheme’ which was elastic enough to respond to the changing needs of the society [15] .
All the Fundamental Rights are not only in consonance with the provisions of Article 37, but also in complete harmony with the intention of the Constitution makers and the Preamble of the Constitution.
The Supreme Court in C. B. Boarding and Lodging v. State of Mysore [16] , asserted that there is “no conflict on the whole”, between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.
Here it was stated that the ambit of freedom of business guaranteed Article 19(1)(g) should be determined in the light of the Directive Article, and that the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles are complementary and supplementary to each other.
Subordinating Fundamental Rights to Directive Principles:
However, since Champakam has not been over-ruled explicitly by any case, the question as to how to reconcile an unavoidable conflict between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles still remained uncertain.
This issue was resolved by the Supreme Court in the landmark judgment of Kesavananda Bharti v. State of Kerala [17] , where views were expressed that fundamental rights of the few must “subserve the common good” as embodied in the Directive Principles, and that whenever the Legislature made a law to implement a Directive Principle the court should up-hold it notwithstanding its inconsistency with any Fundamental Rights, and irrespective of the rule of harmonious construction as between different mandates of the Constitution [18] .
According to Mathew, J. it is imperative that in order to build up a just social order, the Fundamental Rights should be subordinated to the Directive Principles.
Hence the view which taken in this case was that the Fundamental Rights should be subordinated to the Directive Principles.
Hence the courts subordinated the Fundamental Rights to the Directive Principles.
Fundamental Rights and the Directives are complementary to each other :
Chandrachud, C.J., in Minerva Mills Ltd v. Union of India [21] said that the Fundamental Rights “are not an end in themselves, but are, means to an end”.
Further it was said that the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles together constitute the core commitment to social revolution, and together they are the conscience of the Constitution.
Hence section 4 of the 42nd Amendment which gave primacy to Directive principles over Fundamental Rights under Articles 14, 19, 31, was held by the majority to be unconstitutional.
So the courts went back to holding that the Fundamental Rights and the Directives are complementary to each other and did away with the view that Directive Principals should be given primacy.
In Unnikrishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh [23] and a host of other cases [24] it was held that Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles cannot be read to be exclusionary of each other.
Fundamental Rights are a means to achieve the goals specified in the Directives, and they must be construed in the light of Directive Principles.
The fact that the Fundamental Rights should be construed in the light of the Directive Principles has been since then, held by the judges in various cases.
[27] It has now become a judicial strategy to read the Fundamental Rights along with the Directive Principles with a view to define the scope and ambit of the former.
Mostly the Directive Principles have been used to broaden, and give depth to some Fundamental Rights, and to imply more rights therefrom for the people over and above what are expressly stated in the Fundamental Rights.
At the beginning, a strict literal interpretation was advocated and the Fundamental Rights were would prevail over the Directive Principles.
Later in course of time, a perceptible, and a welcome change came over the judicial attitude, and the courts though subordinated the Directives to the Fundamental Rights, took the view that the mechanism of harmonious construction should be used to interpret the two Parts.
Kesavananda Bharti, was a turning point in the history of Directive Principles Jurisprudence, where for the first time the court held that the Directive principles should be given primacy over the Fundamental Rights.

Murder of Joanna Yeates

Was former Cheltenham student Joanna Yeates strangled with her own sock?
Police are investigating whether Bristol murder victim Joanna Yeates could have been strangled with her own ski sock â€“ which her killer might then have kept as a trophy.
The landscape architectâ€™s snow-covered body was found on Christmas morning missing one of her grey, knee-length socks, and detectives believe the garment may hold the key to solving her murder.
The 25-year-old former Cheltenham student â€“ last seen alive nearly three weeks ago â€“ was not wearing her coat or boots either but those items were recovered from her flat in Canynge Road, Clifton, Bristol.
The detective said he was â€œkeeping an open mindâ€ about whether the killer or killers could be keeping the sock as some sort of trophy or whether Miss Yeates was strangled with it.
Mr Jones also confirmed that the killer or killers may have tried to put Miss Yeatesâ€™s body over a wall into the quarry on Longwood Lane, Failand, North Somerset, but instead left her on the grass verge.
This morning uniformed police officers were searching drains in the streets surrounding Joanna Yeatesâ€™s flat.

Joanna Yeates murder: the full truth may never be known
But after Joanna Yeates's frozen body was discovered on a snowy roadside verge on Christmas morning, it became a huge murder hunt and a story that gripped the UK and international media.
The solution to the mystery turned out to be simple: the 25-year-old landscape architect was killed by her neighbour, the Dutch-born engineer Vincent Tabak.
To the torment of her loved ones, however, the truth about exactly what happened on the night of 17 December last year in Flat one, 44 Canynge Road, Bristol, may never be known.
She vanished eight days before Christmas after leaving the Ram pub on Park Street in Bristol, where she had been enjoying after-work drinks with work colleagues.
Tabak and Morson, the daughter of a Harvard-educated lawyer, then left Bristol to spend Christmas in Cambridge at her parents' home.
On Christmas morning, at about the time Tabak and Morson â€“ who remained ignorant of her boyfriend's crime â€“ were opening their gifts, Yeates's body was found by a dog walker, covered in leaves and a pile of snow next to a quarry wall at Longwood Lane, Failand, three miles from Clifton.
On 30 December, Tabak and Morson watched a television news report of the arrest of Joanna Yeates's landlord, the former public school teacher Christopher Jefferies, over the killing.
But the DNA evidence was damning and 30 days after killing Joanna Yeates, Vincent Tabak appeared before Bristol magistrates charged with her murder.
The police deny they were slow in getting to Tabak, saying he left the Bristol area before Yeates' body was found.
Of course, in the end, the death of Joanna Yeates and the continuing agony her family must suffer partly because so much remains unclear is down to Vincent Tabak.
If he is playing a game, it is a cruel one for those who were closest to Joanna Yeates.

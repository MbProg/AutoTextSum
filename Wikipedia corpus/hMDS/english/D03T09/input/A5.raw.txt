CHILDHOOD
1802 Birth Jereboam Beauchamp was born September 6, 1802, in the area that is now Simpson County, Kentucky. … Read More
He was the second son of Thomas and Sally (Smithers) Beauchamp. Both parents were devout Christians. He was named after a paternal uncle, Jereboam O. Beauchamp, a state senator from Washington County, Kentucky.<br /><br /> Beauchamp was educated at Dr. Benjamin Thurston's academy in Barren County, Kentucky until the age of sixteen. Recognizing that his father was not able to sufficiently provide for the family, Beauchamp tried to pay for his education by finding employment as a shopkeeper. While this generated funds for his education, he did not have enough time to pursue his studies. Recommended by Thurston, Beauchamp became preceptor of a school. After saving some money, he returned to Thurston's school as a student, and was later employed by the school as an usher.<br /><br /> By age eighteen, Beauchamp had finished his preparatory studies. After observing the lawyers practicing in Glasgow and Bowling Green, he decided to pursue a career in the legal profession. He particularly admired Solomon Sharp, a young lawyer in his thirties, with whom Beauchamp hoped to study. Read Less

Sharp denied paternity of the child, which was stillborn.<br /><br /> Beauchamp left Bowling Green and lived at his father's estate in Simpson County, where he sought to recover from an illness. He learned that Cooke had become a recluse nearby at her mother's estate after her public disgrace. Having heard from a mutual friend about the woman's beauty and accomplishments, he decided to meet Cooke. At first, she rejected all attention, but gradually received Beauchamp under his guise of borrowing books from her library. The two eventually became friends, and, in 1821, began courting. Beauchamp was eighteen years old; Cooke was at least thirty-four.<br /><br /> When he proposed marriage that year, Cooke told Beauchamp she would marry him on the condition that he kill Sharp. Beauchamp consented. Against Cooke's advice, Beauchamp traveled immediately to Frankfort, where Sharp had recently been appointed attorney general by the governor. Read Less

His political opponents publicized his alleged defense that he could not have been the child's father because the child was mulatto, fathered by a slave. Whether Sharp said this has never been determined with certainty; believing it so, Beauchamp swore to avenge his wife's honor. In the early morning of November 7, 1825, Beauchamp tricked Sharp into answering the door at his home in Frankfort, and fatally stabbed him.<br /><br /> Beauchamp was convicted of the murder and sentenced to hang. The morning of the execution, he and his wife attempted a double suicide by stabbing themselves with a knife she had smuggled into prison. She was successful; he was not. Read Less

Still determined to defend the honor of his wife, Beauchamp devised a ruse to lure Sharp to Bowling Green. He wrote letters to Sharp under various pseudonyms, each asking for his help in some sort of legal matter, and each sent from a different post office. When Sharp failed to respond, Beauchamp decided to go to Frankfort and confront him. Read Less

Sharp had served as the state's attorney general under New Court governors John Adair, whose term lasted until August 1824, and Joseph Desha, who succeeded him in office. The New Court party's power was beginning to wane, however. In 1825, Sharp resigned to run for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. … Read More
During the campaign, opponents raised the issue of his alleged seduction of Anna Cooke. Old Court partisan John Upshaw Waring had handbills distributed that alleged that Sharp had denied paternity of Cooke's child because it was a mulatto and likely fathered by a Cooke family slave. The story apparently did not affect the election, which Sharp won, defeating John J. Crittenden. Whether Sharp had made the claim is uncertain, but Beauchamp believed he had. He began to prepare to murder him and flee to Missouri. He planned to commit the murder in the early morning of November 7, 1825, when the new legislature would convene its session, in the hopes that suspicion would be cast on Sharp's political enemies. Three weeks prior to that date, Beauchamp sold his property, telling his friends that he was planning to move to Missouri. He hired laborers to help load his wagons two days before the planned murder. Read Less
Several witnesses testified against him. Eliza Sharp testified that the voice of the killer was distinct. A test was devised allowing Mrs. Sharp to hear Beauchamp's voice; she immediately identified it as that of the killer. (Beauchamp claimed he had disguised his voice on the night of the murder and thought Mrs. Sharp would not recognize it.) Patrick H. Darby, an Old Court partisan, claimed that in 1824, he had a chance encounter with the man he now knew as Beauchamp. … Read More

In Frankfort in 1825, Sharp was in the middle of a bitter political battle known as the Old Court-New Court controversy.

Later, Beauchamp claimed that he had arranged for the warrant to give him a reason to be in Frankfort and present for the murder. The historian Fred Johnson says that the incorporation of the warrant into Beauchamp's story was likely done after the fact as a means of damage control - especially considering that fathering an illegitimate child was the reason for his planned murder of Sharp.<br /><br /> Preparing to travel, Beauchamp packed a change of clothes, a black mask, and a knife with poison on the tip, to be used as the murder weapon. Finding all the inns filled when he arrived at Frankfort, he took lodging at the residence of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Between nine and ten o'clock that evening, Beauchamp went to Sharp's home. Dressed in a disguise, he carried his usual clothes and buried them along the bank of the Kentucky River for retrieval following the murder. Discovering that Sharp was not home, Beauchamp sought him in the city and found him at a local tavern. He returned to Sharp's house to wait for him, seeing him arrive about midnight. Read Less

New Court partisans talked of Sharp's murder as the work of the Old Court party, just as Beauchamp had hoped. One suspect was Waring, who had printed the handbills critical of Sharp. Known as a violent man, he had both political and personal motivation for the crime. He was cleared of suspicion when investigators learned that, at the time of the murder, Waring was in Fayette County recovering from unrelated injuries.<br /><br /> Suspicion moved to Beauchamp, as he was loyal to the Old Court Party, and was known to hate Sharp for his political principles. People knew of Sharp's earlier alleged involvement with Anna Cooke before her marriage to Beauchamp. In addition, Beauchamp was placed in Frankfort the night of the killing, and his host, Joel Scott, said that he had heard Beauchamp leave in the night. After presenting preliminary testimony, Commonwealth's Attorney Charles Bibb asked for additional time to assemble more witnesses. Beauchamp assented to the request. A second delay pushed the hearings back to mid-December. Read Less

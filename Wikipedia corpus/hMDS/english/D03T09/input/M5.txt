Jereboam O. Beauchamp
Jereboam Orville Beauchamp was an American lawyer who murdered the Kentucky legislator Solomon P. Sharp, an event known as the Beauchampâ€“Sharp Tragedy.
In 1821, Sharp was accused of fathering the illegitimate stillborn child of a woman named Anna Cooke.
Sharp denied paternity of the child, and public opinion favored him.
In 1824, Beauchamp married Cooke.
During Sharp's 1825 campaign for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives, Cooke's alleged illegitimate child was raised as an issue.

I cannot pray!
—My soul is at war with God!
The frightful sounds of merriment below
Disturb my senses—go!
I cannot pray—
The sweet airs from the garden worry me!
Thy presence grieves me—go!
—Thy priestly raiment
Fills me with dread—Thy ebony crucifix
With horror and awe!
(IV, 76-82)
These passages can be compared with two passages from Beauchamp’s Confession (pp. 9-10) about Ann               Cook: “She sternly refused to make any acquaintances or even to receive the society or visits of her former acquaintances               . . . . and she said she could never be happy in society again.”
The Monk’s speech               reflects a remark of the “Mrs. Ellen R——n,” to whom Ann Cook’s letters were addressed.
She says (p. 37): “I begged her to consult her Bible; for in that alone she would find happiness and peace; and to struggle to               subdue her violent passions, which might yet lead her into the commission of dreadful errors.”
In her Letters (p. 60) Ann Cook, in reference to Colonel Sharp, wrote of suffering her “heart to be               irrecoverably lost and blighted by one so little to be trusted —so little worthy of [her] affections.
But whom I yet               love.”
Poe writes:
And ever and anon amid her sobs
She murmured forth Castiglione’s name
. . . . she loves him still!
(1, 52-54)
When the Monk advises her to “think of Cher] precious soul!”
Lalage replies:
Think of my early days!
Think of my father
And mother in Heaven!
Think of our quiet home,
And the rivulet that ran before the door!
Think of my little sisters!
—think of them!
(IV, 83-86)
Beauchamp in his Confessions (p. 90) wrote that Ann Cook’s “father, brothers and friends, by               a most strange succession of calamities had been swept into the grave.”
In Scene VII Politian confesses his love for Lalage in spite of “knowing what he knows” and “seeing what he has seen.”
He loves her for her “beauty” and her “woes.”
She               reminds him that her “seared and blighted name” would not tally “with the ancestral honours of [his] house               / And with [its] glory.”
He answers that he loathes the name of glory and tells her that it does not matter they “go               down unhonoured and forgotten / Into the dust—so [they] descend together.”
She reminds him that “A deed is               to be done— / Castiglione lives!”
to which he replies that “he shall die!”
After some hesitation               about the forthcoming death of Castiglione, she decides that “—’tis very well!
/ So that the blade be               keen—the blow be sure.”
Much of this scene is founded largely on fact; pages 74-75 of Ann Cook’s Letters read:
. . . . He offered me his hand.
Yes, forlorn and abandoned as I was, he was willing to                 become my husband as he had been my friend.
What could I do?
I addressed him candidly and openly.
[page 26:]
‘You know my history,’ said I, ‘and my shame, if you are willing to receive to your                 bosom a poor outcast, whom the world has stigmatised as guilty and polluted, with a wounded heart and a blighted name, then take me.
I                 am yours forever.’
‘My dear Ann,’ he replied, ‘I regard you as the innocent victim of the most detestable                 treachery.... I have long admired the cultivation of your mind, and the proud dignity and elevation of your soul You were calculated                 to grace the most elevated circles of society . . . . I am proud to be the object of your choice, humbled                 as you may be in your estimation, or . . . . in that of an unfeeling                 world. . . . my attachment is deep, sincere, and ardent, and while we live it shall never become                 extinct. . . . .’
A reporter for the Lexington Kentucky Reporter of July 7, 1826, recorded Beauchamp’s farewell to his               dying wife as follows: “‘Farewell,’ said he, ‘child of sorrow— Farewell child of               misfortune and persecution—you are now secure from the tongue of slander—for you I have lived; for you I               die.
’” Poe could have read this newspaper article, for it was quoted in an appendix to the Confession.
And               Poe’s Politian says: “And life shall then be mine, for I will live / For Thee, and in shine eyes— and Thou               shalt be / No more a mourner—” (VII, 7880).
Much of Scene IX, in which Politian seeks out Castiglione to engage him in a duel, thus to avenge the grievous wrong               Castiglione has done Lalage, follows very closely Beauchamp’s description in his Confession ( pp. 15-17) of an               encounter with Colonel Sharp.
Politian (drawing) says: “Thus to the expiatory tomb, / Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee /               In the name of Lalage!”
(59-61).
Castiglione replies: “Hold off thy hand—with that beloved name / So fresh               upon thy lips I will not fight thee / I cannot—dare not” (66-69).
In his Confession (p. 15) Beauchamp wrote: “Colonel Sharp, I have come deputed and sent by her, to                 take your life.... Will you fight me a duel?”
To which, according to Beauchamp, Sharp replied, “My dear friend               I cannot fight you, on account of Miss Cook.... I never can fight the friend of that worthy injured lady.”
In the play Castiglione falls upon his knees at the feet of Politian and says “Alas!
my lord, / It               is—it is— most true.
In such a cause / I am the veriest coward.
O pity me!”
(72-73).
Beauchamp, thinking               that Sharp was about to run, sprang forward, caught him by the breast of his coat, and said, “Now you damn’d               villain, you shall die.”
Sharp then fell on his knees and said, “My life is in your hands, my friend I beg my life.
Spare it for mercy’s sake.”
Beauchamp then records that he said “. . . .               tomorrow I shall horsewhip you in the streets, and repeat it daily till you fight me a duel.... You are about such a whining coward, as               I was told you were.”
In lines 85-90 Politian says:
Think not to fly me thus.
Do thou prepare
For public insult in she streets—before
The eves of the citizens.
I’ll follow thee—
Like an avenging spirit I’ll follow thee
Even unto death.
Before those whom thou lovest—
Before all Rome I’ll taunt thee, villain—
[column 2:]
The final scene (XI), “Interior of the Coliseum,” is comprised almost entirely of Poe’s               poem The Coliseum which Poe incorporated into the play as a soliloquy said by Politian.
After the soliloquy Lalage enters “wildly” and informs Politian that “the hour is come / For vengeance or will never” (55-56) for               Alessandra and Castiglione (the bride and bridegroom) are now at the altar rail.
The again-aroused Politian swears that “By               the God of Heaven / I’ll mar this bridal if at the altar’s foot / The bridegroom dies,” and dashes out               (60-61).
Mabbott (I, 297) suggests that Poe seems here to recall something on page 84 of Ann Cook’s Letters where she wrote, “I suggested that it would be better to plunge the dagger into his heart while folded in the arms of her for whom he deserted               me.”
He further suggests (p. 298) that in ¢he final speech of Poe’s play when Lalage says: “Farewell Castiglione and farewell / My hope in Heaven!”
(62-64), she (unlike her prototype in real life) repents,               although too late.
Poe continued an interest in the Beauchamp-Sharp case well after he abandoned his play based on it, for he commented               several times on the theme as it was treated by some of his contemporaries.
In a review of William Gilmore Simms’ Beauchampe (1842) in Graham’s Magazine, 20 (May 1842), 320, Poe wrote:
The events upon which this novel is based are but too real.
No more thrilling, no more romantic tragedy did ever the brain of poet                 conceive than was the tragedy of Sharpe [sic] and Beauchampe [sic].
We are not sure that the author of ‘Border                 Eagles’ has done right in the selection of his theme.
Too little has been left for invention.
We are sure, however, that the                 theme is skillfully handled.
In a review of Simms’ The Wigwam and the Cabin in the Broadway Journal, 2 (October 4, 1845), 190, Poe wrote “‘Beauchampe’ is intensely interesting; but the historical truth has somewhat hampered and repressed the               natural strength of the artist.”
Charles Fenno Hoffman wrote Greyslaer ( 1840), and in his Literati article on               Hoffman in Godey’s Lady’s Book, 33 (October 1846), 157, Poe commented:
. . . . Greyslaer followed a romance based on a well known murder of Sharp, the Solicitor General                 of Kentucky, by Beauchampe [sic].
W. Gilmore Simms . . . . has treated the subject more effectively in his                 novel ‘Beauchampe’, but the fact is that both gentlemen have positively failed, as might have been expected                 . . . . The real events were more impressive than the fictitious ones.
The facts of this remarkable                 tragedy, as arranged by actual circumstances, would put to shame the skill of the consummate artist. . . .                 The incidents might be better woven into a tragedy. . . .

(5) Although Mabbott believes that Poe composed the play in 1835 (see his edition of Politian, p. 58), the early date of the               two pamphlets and the late date of Hoffman’s work (almost the same as Poe’s first fragment) suggest that Ingram (p.               111) may be correct in believing that Poe may have written at least a portion of Politian as early as 1831—a view               endorsed by James A. Harrison Complete Works (New York: Crowell, 1902), and J. H. Whitty, The Complete Works (New York,               1911).
Mabbott doubts Ingram, Harrison, and Whitty on this point, if they are correct, it throws out Mabbott’s theory that Poe               learned of the case through Hoffman.
It is known, however, that he was still at work on the play in the spring of 1835.
John P. Kennedy,               in a letter dated 13 April 1835 to T. W. White, proprietor of the Southern Literary Messenger, wrote that Poe was “at               work upon a tragedy, but I have turned him to drudging upon whatever may make money” (see Rufus Wilmot Griswold, “Memoir,” p. xxix).
Poe seems never to have been happy about the play, perhaps because it did not meet the high               aesthetic standards he set for himself.
Mabbott (Collected Works, I, 241) feels that Poe abandoned the play deliberately, “for while the play is unfinished, the conclusion was obviously planned.”
Fewer than “one hundred of the               lines written have been lost, and the general plan of the final scene is obvious.”
Mabbott also notes that Poe never published               the play as an entity nor decided finally on the division into acts.
Mabbott numbers the scenes I to XI.
Stovall (Poems, p. 341)               disagrees.
Poe published five scenes of Politian in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1835-36 which were reproduced in The Raven and Other Poems in 1845.
In 1846, when asked about the other scenes, Poe replied, “There is no more of ‘Politian.

            <p class="hrline"/>
            <p> On November 7, 1825, Frankfort, Kentucky, was startled by the murder of Colonel Solomon P. Sharp, former Congressman, Attorney-General
              of the State, and at the time of his death a member-elect of the Kentucky House of Representatives, by Jereboam O. Beauchamp, a young
              lawyer. The subsequent trial reminded many of the residents that Sharp had in 1819 been involved in a scandal concerning Miss Ann Cook,
              a lady of good family, and had been accused by some of fathering her child who was stillborn. In consequence of the stain upon her
              reputation, Miss Cook retired to her family&rsquo;s farm. Beauchamp heard of her disgrace and, although she was sixteen years older
              than he, he repeatedly proposed marriage to her. She finally said that she would accept on the condition that he avenge her dishonor by
              killing her betrayer. To this stipulation he immediately agreed and in 1821 went to Frankfort to challenge the Colonel to a duel. Sharp
              refused to fight and Beauchamp threatened to horsewhip him publicly, but the Colonel left Frankfort before Beauchamp could carry out his
              threat. In 1824 Beauchamp and Ann Cook were married. Infuriated by additional slanderous statements against his wife, Beauchamp went
              again to Frankfort in 1825, certain that Sharp&mdash;who was there to attend the opening session of the legislature&mdash; could
              no longer elude him. At 2:00 a.m. of the morning the legislature was to convene, Beauchamp persuaded Sharp by a ruse to open his door
              and &ldquo;plunged a dagger in his heart.&rdquo; On May 19, 1826, after a sensational trial, he was sentenced to be hanged. His
              wife was acquitted of complicity in the crime and was permitted to share his cell until the execution. The two attempted suicide shortly
              before the date set for his execution. She died of her wounds, but he was dragged from his cell and hanged on July 7, 1826. They were
              buried in one grave. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> This series of incidents, which was almost immediately labelled the &ldquo;Kentucky Tragedy,&rdquo; attracted
              Poe, together with many of his contemporaries. But although Poe&rsquo;s unfinished verse drama <i>Politian (</i> 1835-36?) has long
              been considered to have been inspired by the real-life drama of Beauchamp and Sharp, the resemblances attributed have been only the most
              general. Floyd Stovall, in fact, has stated flatly that &ldquo;Poe&rsquo;s tragedy has little in common with the Beauchamp-Sharp
              affair.&rdquo;] It is my contention here that the <i>facts</i> of the real case directly generated various parts of <i>Politian,</i>
              and that the work rather closely parallels the Beauchamp-Sharp story. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Accounts of the murder, trial, and execution appeared in the newspapers of 1825 and 1826, especially the seven
              newspapers of Frankfort, Kentucky. Thomas Ollive Mabbott, in his edition of <i>Politian</i> (2), felt that it is more than probable that
              Poe&rsquo;s attention was called to the story by the account given in Chapter XXXIV of Charles Fenno Hoffman&rsquo;s <i>Winter
                in the West,</i> which bears the date <span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;25:]</span> 1835 on its title page but came out in time to be
              reviewed in the New York <i>American Monthly Magazine</i> for December 1834. Hoffman wrote: </p>
            <div class="blockquote">
              <p class="flind4"> Incidents like these .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seem from the exaggerated sentiment and romantic rashness
                they betray, as belonging to a bygone age or transpiring on a different planet. But assuming a people so earnest in character as the
                Kentuckians, and in a community whose sympathies have been outraged by such a tissue of monstrous guilt and romantic infatuation
                .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the tragic fate of Beauchamp and his wife sinks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. into
                men&rsquo;s bosoms; and the story of their strange loves, of her cruel wrong and his dark revenge, of the savage retribution they
                exacted from the author of their misery and their crime, and the touching heroism of the death they shared at last
                together&mdash;all combine to make up a drama of real life which can never be forgotten among the scenes where it was enacted.
                  (<i>Winter in the West,</i> II, 161) </p>
            </div>
            <p> If this account drew Poe&rsquo;s attention to the Beauchamp-Sharp tragedy, he could hardly have failed to see that the facts of
              this celebrated case were fully as romantic as his own fiction (3). Mabbott suggests that from Hoffman&rsquo;s words Poe probably
              took the idea of &ldquo;<i>drama set in another age</i> &ldquo; and that a brief notice of Hoffman&rsquo;s book in the
                <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i> (April 1835) is probably Poe&rsquo;s.4 Despite the fact that the case had been the subject of
              several literary works since 1826, the only other sources Poe seems to have used are two pamphlets: <i>The Confession of Jereboam O.
                Beauchamp .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (Bloomfield,</i> Ky., 1826); and &ldquo;Letters of Ann Cook, late Mrs. Beauchamp, to
              her friend in Maryland containing a short history of the life of that remarkable woman, published by one W. R&mdash;&mdash;n, of
              Charles County, Maryland&rdquo; (Washington, D.C., 1826) (5). </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Poe placed the action of his play in Rome (Mabbott suggests the sixteenth century) and most of the names of his
              characters he found in Italian history. Beauchamp&rsquo;s wife, Ann Cook, he named Lalage, a name familiar from Horace; Beauchamp
              became Politian, named for the Florentine scholar and poet Angelo Ambrogini Poliziano (1454-1494); and to Colonel Sharp he gave the name
              Castiglione, the surname of Baldassare Castiglione (1478-1529), author of <i>The Book of the Courtier.</i> As Arthur Hobson Quinn points
              out (p. 232) Poe &ldquo;made several changes in the characters of the principal actors in the drama.&rdquo; For instance,
              Politian is an Englishman, the Earl of Leicester, on a visit to Rome, and instead of being acquainted with the heroine, as in the
              Kentucky drama, he is so attracted by her voice as she sings in another room of the castle, that he falls in love with her before he has
              seen her. Despite the foreign locale and foreign names, Poe clearly based these characters and others in no small measure on the
              romantic figures of the Kentucky tragedy. Many of the phrases and actions are copied from life, and it is with these that I am here
              concerned. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Although Lalage was Castiglione&rsquo;s &ldquo;plighted wife&rdquo; he has spurned her for the affections
              of Alessandra, a niece of the Duke Di Broglio who is Castiglione&rsquo;s father, and they are to be married &ldquo;tomorrow
              week.&rdquo; The immediate result is that Lalage &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sits alone / Continually in her
              chamber with clasped hands&rdquo; (I, 47-48). And to a Monk who says to her: </p>

            </div>
            <p class="flind4"> These passages can be compared with two passages from Beauchamp&rsquo;s <i>Confession</i> (pp. 9-10) about Ann
              Cook: &ldquo;She sternly refused to make any acquaintances or even to receive the society or visits of her former acquaintances
              .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and she said she could never be happy in society again.&rdquo; The Monk&rsquo;s speech
              reflects a remark of the &ldquo;Mrs. Ellen R&mdash;&mdash;n,&rdquo; to whom Ann Cook&rsquo;s letters were addressed.
              She says (p. 37): &ldquo;I begged her to consult her Bible; for in that alone she would find happiness and peace; and to struggle to
              subdue her violent passions, which might yet lead her into the commission of dreadful errors.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In her <i>Letters</i> (p. 60) Ann Cook, in reference to Colonel Sharp, wrote of suffering her &ldquo;heart to be
              irrecoverably lost and blighted by one so little to be trusted &mdash;so little worthy of [her] affections. But whom I yet
              love.&rdquo; Poe writes: </p>
            <div class="quotepoem" style="max-width: 20em;">
              <p class="pmline"> And ever and anon amid her sobs </p>
              <p class="pmline"> She murmured forth Castiglione&rsquo;s name </p>
              <p class="pmline"> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she loves him still! (1, 52-54) </p>
            </div>
            <p> When the Monk advises her to &ldquo;think of Cher] precious soul!&rdquo; Lalage replies: </p>
            <div class="quotepoem" style="max-width: 20em;">
              <p class="pmline"> Think of my early days! Think of my father </p>
              <p class="pmline"> And mother in Heaven! Think of our quiet home, </p>
              <p class="pmline"> And the rivulet that ran before the door! </p>
              <p class="pmline"> Think of my little sisters!&mdash;think of them! (IV, 83-86) </p>
            </div>
            <p class="flind4"> Beauchamp in his <i>Confessions (p. 90)</i> wrote that Ann Cook&rsquo;s &ldquo;father, brothers and friends, by
              a most strange succession of calamities had been swept into the grave.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In Scene VII Politian confesses his love for Lalage in spite of &ldquo;knowing what he knows&rdquo; and
              &ldquo;seeing what he has seen.&rdquo; He loves her for her &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; and her &ldquo;woes.&rdquo; She
              reminds him that her &ldquo;seared and blighted name&rdquo; would not tally &ldquo;with the ancestral honours of [his] house
              / And with [its] glory.&rdquo; He answers that he loathes the name of glory and tells her that it does not matter they &ldquo;go
              down unhonoured and forgotten / Into the dust&mdash;so [they] descend together.&rdquo; She reminds him that &ldquo;A deed is
              to be done&mdash; / Castiglione lives!&rdquo; to which he replies that &ldquo;he shall die!&rdquo; After some hesitation
              about the forthcoming death of Castiglione, she decides that &ldquo;&mdash;&rsquo;tis very well! / So that the blade be
              keen&mdash;the blow be sure.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Much of this scene is founded largely on fact; pages 74-75 of Ann Cook&rsquo;s <i>Letters</i> read: </p>
            <div class="blockquote">
              <p class="flind4"> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He offered me his hand. Yes, forlorn and abandoned as I was, he was willing to
                become my husband as he had been my friend. What could I do? I addressed him candidly and openly. <span class="pgloc"
                  >[page&nbsp;26:]</span>
              </p>
              <p class="flind4"> &lsquo;You know my history,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and my shame, if you are willing to receive to your
                bosom a poor outcast, whom the world has stigmatised as guilty and polluted, with a wounded heart and a blighted name, then take me. I
                am yours forever.&rsquo; </p>
              <p class="flind4"> &lsquo;My dear Ann,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;I regard you as the innocent victim of the most detestable
                treachery.... I have long admired the cultivation of your mind, and the proud dignity and elevation of your soul You were calculated
                to grace the most elevated circles of society .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am proud to be the object of your choice, humbled
                as you may be in your estimation, or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in that of an unfeeling
                world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my attachment is deep, sincere, and ardent, and while we live it shall never become
                extinct.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&rsquo; </p>
            </div>
            <p class="flind4"> A reporter for the Lexington <i>Kentucky Reporter</i> of July 7, 1826, recorded Beauchamp&rsquo;s farewell to his
              dying wife as follows: &ldquo;&lsquo;Farewell,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;child of sorrow&mdash; Farewell child of
              misfortune and persecution&mdash;you are now secure from the tongue of slander&mdash;for you I have lived; for you I
              die.&rsquo;&rdquo; Poe could have read this newspaper article, for it was quoted in an appendix to the <i>Confession.</i> And
              Poe&rsquo;s Politian says: &ldquo;And life shall then be mine, for I will live / For Thee, and in shine eyes&mdash; and Thou
              shalt be / No more a mourner&mdash;&rdquo; (VII, 7880). </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Much of Scene IX, in which Politian seeks out Castiglione to engage him in a duel, thus to avenge the grievous wrong
              Castiglione has done Lalage, follows very closely Beauchamp&rsquo;s description in his <i>Confession (</i> pp. 15-17) of an
              encounter with Colonel Sharp. Politian (drawing) says: &ldquo;Thus to the expiatory tomb, / Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee /
              In the name of Lalage!&rdquo; (59-61). Castiglione replies: &ldquo;Hold off thy hand&mdash;with that beloved name / So fresh
              upon thy lips I will not fight thee / I cannot&mdash;dare not&rdquo; (66-69). </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In his <i>Confession</i> (p. 15) Beauchamp wrote: &ldquo;Colonel Sharp, I <i>have come deputed and sent by her, to
                take your life....</i> Will you fight me a duel?&rdquo; To which, according to Beauchamp, Sharp replied, &ldquo;My dear friend
              I cannot fight you, on account of Miss Cook.... I never can fight the friend of that worthy injured lady.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In the play Castiglione falls upon his knees at the feet of Politian and says &ldquo;Alas! my lord, / It
              is&mdash;it is&mdash; most true. In such a cause / I am the veriest coward. O pity me!&rdquo; (72-73). Beauchamp, thinking
              that Sharp was about to run, sprang forward, caught him by the breast of his coat, and said, &ldquo;Now you damn&rsquo;d
              villain, you shall die.&rdquo; Sharp then fell on his knees and said, &ldquo;My life is in your hands, my friend I beg my life.
              Spare it for mercy&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; Beauchamp then records that he said &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
              tomorrow I shall horsewhip you in the streets, and repeat it daily till you fight me a duel.... You are about such a whining coward, as
              I was told you were.&rdquo; In lines 85-90 Politian says: </p>
            <div class="quotepoem" style="max-width: 20em;">
              <p class="pmline"> Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare </p>

            <p>
              <span class="pgloc">[column&nbsp;2:]</span>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The final scene (XI), &ldquo;Interior of the Coliseum,&rdquo; is comprised almost entirely of Poe&rsquo;s
              poem <i>The Coliseum</i> which Poe incorporated into the play as a soliloquy said by Politian. After the soliloquy Lalage enters
              &ldquo;wildly&rdquo; and informs Politian that &ldquo;the hour is come / For vengeance or will never&rdquo; (55-56) for
              Alessandra and Castiglione (the bride and bridegroom) are now at the altar rail. The again-aroused Politian swears that &ldquo;By
              the God of Heaven / I&rsquo;ll mar this bridal if at the altar&rsquo;s foot / The bridegroom dies,&rdquo; and dashes out
              (60-61). Mabbott (I, 297) suggests that Poe seems here to recall something on page 84 of Ann Cook&rsquo;s Letters where she wrote,
              &ldquo;I suggested that it would be better to plunge the dagger into his heart while folded in the arms of her for whom he deserted
              me.&rdquo; He further suggests (p. 298) that in &cent;he final speech of Poe&rsquo;s play when Lalage says:
              &ldquo;Farewell Castiglione and farewell / My hope in Heaven!&rdquo; (62-64), she (unlike her prototype in real life) repents,
              although too late. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Poe continued an interest in the Beauchamp-Sharp case well after he abandoned his play based on it, for he commented
              several times on the theme as it was treated by some of his contemporaries. In a review of William Gilmore Simms&rsquo;
                <i>Beauchampe</i> (1842) in <i>Graham&rsquo;s Magazine,</i> 20 (May 1842), 320, Poe wrote: </p>
            <div class="blockquote">
              <p> The events upon which this novel is based are but too real. No more thrilling, no more romantic tragedy did ever the brain of poet
                conceive than was the tragedy of Sharpe [sic] and Beauchampe [sic]. We are not sure that the author of &lsquo;Border
                Eagles&rsquo; has done right in the selection of his theme. Too little has been left for invention. We are sure, however, that the
                theme is skillfully handled. </p>
            </div>
            <p> In a review of Simms&rsquo; <i>The Wigwam and the Cabin</i> in the <i>Broadway Journal</i>, 2 (October 4, 1845), 190, Poe wrote
              &ldquo;&lsquo;Beauchampe&rsquo; is intensely interesting; but the historical truth has somewhat hampered and repressed the
              natural strength of the artist.&rdquo; Charles Fenno Hoffman wrote <i>Greyslaer (</i> 1840), and in his <i>Literati</i> article on
              Hoffman in <i>Godey&rsquo;s Lady&rsquo;s Book, 33</i> (October 1846), 157, Poe commented: </p>
            <div class="blockquote">
              <p> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Greyslaer</i> followed a romance based on a well known murder of Sharp, the Solicitor General
                of Kentucky, by Beauchampe [sic]. W. Gilmore Simms .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has treated the subject more effectively in his
                novel &lsquo;Beauchampe&rsquo;, but the fact is that both gentlemen have positively failed, as might have been expected
                .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The real events were more impressive than the fictitious ones. The <i>facts</i> of this remarkable
                tragedy, as arranged by actual circumstances, would put to shame the skill of the consummate artist.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
                The incidents might be better woven into a tragedy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </p>

            </p>
            <p> (5) Although Mabbott believes that Poe composed the play in 1835 (see his edition of <i>Politian</i>, p. 58), the early date of the
              two pamphlets and the late date of Hoffman&rsquo;s work (almost the same as Poe&rsquo;s first fragment) suggest that Ingram (p.
              111) may be correct in believing that Poe may have written at least a portion of <i>Politian</i> as early as 1831&mdash;a view
              endorsed by James A. Harrison <i>Complete Works</i> (New York: Crowell, 1902), and J. H. Whitty, <i>The Complete Works</i> (New York,
              1911). Mabbott doubts Ingram, Harrison, and Whitty on this point, if they are correct, it throws out Mabbott&rsquo;s theory that Poe
              learned of the case through Hoffman. It is known, however, that he was still at work on the play in the spring of 1835. John P. Kennedy,
              in a letter dated 13 April 1835 to T. W. White, proprietor of the <i>Southern Literary Messenger,</i> wrote that Poe was &ldquo;at
              work upon a tragedy, but I have turned him to drudging upon whatever may make money&rdquo; (see Rufus Wilmot Griswold,
              &ldquo;Memoir,&rdquo; p. xxix). Poe seems never to have been happy about the play, perhaps because it did not meet the high
              aesthetic standards he set for himself. Mabbott (<i>Collected Works,</i> I, 241) feels that Poe abandoned the play deliberately,
              &ldquo;for while the play is unfinished, the conclusion was obviously planned.&rdquo; Fewer than &ldquo;one hundred of the
              lines written have been lost, and the general plan of the final scene is obvious.&rdquo; Mabbott also notes that Poe never published
              the play as an entity nor decided finally on the division into acts. Mabbott numbers the scenes I to XI. Stovall (<i>Poems</i>, p. 341)
              disagrees. Poe published five scenes of <i>Politian</i> in the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i> in 1835-36 which were reproduced in
                <i>The Raven and Other Poems</i> in 1845. In 1846, when asked about the other scenes, Poe replied, &ldquo;There is no more of
              &lsquo;Politian.&rsquo;&rdquo; See Arthur Hobson Quinn, <i>Edgar Allan Poe, A Critical Biography</i> (New York: D. Appleton
              Century, 1941), p. 522. </p>

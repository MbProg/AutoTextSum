 The Kentucky Tragedy: A Story of Conflict and Change in Antebellum America. By Dickson D. Bruce Jr. (Baton Rouge, La.: Louisiana State University Press, 2006. Pp. ix, 183. $40.00.)

Early on the morning of 7 November 1825, Jereboam O. Beauchamp stabbed to death Colonel Solomon E Sharp in the entryway of Sharp's Frankfort, Kentucky, home. Beauchamp killed Sharp because he had allegedly seduced and impregnated Ann Cooke about six years earlier and thereafter denied the affair, describing Cooke's stillborn child as a mulatto. Beauchamp had married Cooke in June 1824. He was tried and convicted for murder in June 1826. On the day he was to be hanged, Beauchamp and his wife attempted to execute a suicide pact in which they first drank laudanum and then stabbed themselves.

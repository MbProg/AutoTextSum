Poeâ€™s Politian and the Beauchamp-Sharp Tragedy
William J. Kimball
Converse College
On November 7, 1825, Frankfort, Kentucky, was startled by the murder of Colonel Solomon P. Sharp, former Congressman, Attorney-General of the State, and at the time of his death a member-elect of the Kentucky House of Representatives, by Jereboam O. Beauchamp, a young lawyer.
The subsequent trial reminded many of the residents that Sharp had in 1819 been involved in a scandal concerning Miss Ann Cook, a lady of good family, and had been accused by some of fathering her child who was stillborn.
In consequence of the stain upon her reputation, Miss Cook retired to her familyâ€™s farm.
Beauchamp heard of her disgrace and, although she was sixteen years older than he, he repeatedly proposed marriage to her.
She finally said that she would accept on the condition that he avenge her dishonor by killing her betrayer.
To this stipulation he immediately agreed and in 1821 went to Frankfort to challenge the Colonel to a duel.
Sharp refused to fight and Beauchamp threatened to horsewhip him publicly, but the Colonel left Frankfort before Beauchamp could carry out his threat.
In 1824 Beauchamp and Ann Cook were married.
Infuriated by additional slanderous statements against his wife, Beauchamp went again to Frankfort in 1825, certain that Sharpâ€”who was there to attend the opening session of the legislatureâ€” could no longer elude him.
At 2:00 a.m. of the morning the legislature was to convene, Beauchamp persuaded Sharp by a ruse to open his door and â€œplunged a dagger in his heart.â€ On May 19, 1826, after a sensational trial, he was sentenced to be hanged.
His wife was acquitted of complicity in the crime and was permitted to share his cell until the execution.
The two attempted suicide shortly before the date set for his execution.
She died of her wounds, but he was dragged from his cell and hanged on July 7, 1826.
They were buried in one grave.
This series of incidents, which was almost immediately labelled the â€œKentucky Tragedy,â€ attracted Poe, together with many of his contemporaries.
But although Poeâ€™s unfinished verse drama Politian ( 1835-36?)
has long been considered to have been inspired by the real-life drama of Beauchamp and Sharp, the resemblances attributed have been only the most general.
Floyd Stovall, in fact, has stated flatly that â€œPoeâ€™s tragedy has little in common with the Beauchamp-Sharp affair.â€] It is my contention here that the facts of the real case directly generated various parts of Politian, and that the work rather closely parallels the Beauchamp-Sharp story.
Accounts of the murder, trial, and execution appeared in the newspapers of 1825 and 1826, especially the seven newspapers of Frankfort, Kentucky.
Thomas Ollive Mabbott, in his edition of Politian (2), felt that it is more than probable that Poeâ€™s attention was called to the story by the account given in Chapter XXXIV of Charles Fenno Hoffmanâ€™s Winter in the West, which bears the date [page 25:] 1835 on its title page but came out in time to be reviewed in the New York American Monthly Magazine for December 1834.
Hoffman wrote:
Incidents like these . . . . seem from the exaggerated sentiment and romantic rashness they betray, as belonging to a bygone age or transpiring on a different planet.
But assuming a people so earnest in character as the Kentuckians, and in a community whose sympathies have been outraged by such a tissue of monstrous guilt and romantic infatuation . . . . the tragic fate of Beauchamp and his wife sinks . . . . into menâ€™s bosoms; and the story of their strange loves, of her cruel wrong and his dark revenge, of the savage retribution they exacted from the author of their misery and their crime, and the touching heroism of the death they shared at last togetherâ€”all combine to make up a drama of real life which can never be forgotten among the scenes where it was enacted.
(Winter in the West, II, 161)
If this account drew Poeâ€™s attention to the Beauchamp-Sharp tragedy, he could hardly have failed to see that the facts of this celebrated case were fully as romantic as his own fiction (3).
Mabbott suggests that from Hoffmanâ€™s words Poe probably took the idea of â€œdrama set in another age â€œ and that a brief notice of Hoffmanâ€™s book in the Southern Literary Messenger (April 1835) is probably Poeâ€™s.4 Despite the fact that the case had been the subject of several literary works since 1826, the only other sources Poe seems to have used are two pamphlets: The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp . . . . (Bloomfield, Ky., 1826); and â€œLetters of Ann Cook, late Mrs. Beauchamp, to her friend in Maryland containing a short history of the life of that remarkable woman, published by one W. Râ€”â€”n, of Charles County, Marylandâ€ (Washington, D.C., 1826) (5).
Poe placed the action of his play in Rome (Mabbott suggests the sixteenth century) and most of the names of his characters he found in Italian history.
Beauchampâ€™s wife, Ann Cook, he named Lalage, a name familiar from Horace; Beauchamp became Politian, named for the Florentine scholar and poet Angelo Ambrogini Poliziano (1454-1494); and to Colonel Sharp he gave the name Castiglione, the surname of Baldassare Castiglione (1478-1529), author of The Book of the Courtier.
As Arthur Hobson Quinn points out (p. 232) Poe â€œmade several changes in the characters of the principal actors in the drama.â€ For instance, Politian is an Englishman, the Earl of Leicester, on a visit to Rome, and instead of being acquainted with the heroine, as in the Kentucky drama, he is so attracted by her voice as she sings in another room of the castle, that he falls in love with her before he has seen her.
Despite the foreign locale and foreign names, Poe clearly based these characters and others in no small measure on the romantic figures of the Kentucky tragedy.
Many of the phrases and actions are copied from life, and it is with these that I am here concerned.
Although Lalage was Castiglioneâ€™s â€œplighted wifeâ€ he has spurned her for the affections of Alessandra, a niece of the Duke Di Broglio who is Castiglioneâ€™s father, and they are to be married â€œtomorrow week.â€ The immediate result is that Lalage â€œ. . . . sits alone / Continually in her chamber with clasped handsâ€ (I, 47-48).
And to a Monk who says to her:
Refuge thou hast,
Sweet daughter!
in Heaven.
Think of eternal things!
Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray!
(IV, 74-75)
[column 2:]
She replies:
I cannot pray!â€”My soul is at war with God!
The frightful sounds of merriment below
Disturb my sensesâ€”go!
I cannot prayâ€”
The sweet airs from the garden worry me!
Thy presence grieves meâ€”go!â€”Thy priestly raiment
Fills me with dreadâ€”Thy ebony crucifix
With horror and awe!
(IV, 76-82)
These passages can be compared with two passages from Beauchampâ€™s Confession (pp. 9-10) about Ann Cook: â€œShe sternly refused to make any acquaintances or even to receive the society or visits of her former acquaintances . . . . and she said she could never be happy in society again.â€ The Monkâ€™s speech reflects a remark of the â€œMrs.
Ellen Râ€”â€”n,â€ to whom Ann Cookâ€™s letters were addressed.
She says (p. 37): â€œI begged her to consult her Bible; for in that alone she would find happiness and peace; and to struggle to subdue her violent passions, which might yet lead her into the commission of dreadful errors.â€
In her Letters (p. 60) Ann Cook, in reference to Colonel Sharp, wrote of suffering her â€œheart to be irrecoverably lost and blighted by one so little to be trusted â€”so little worthy of [her] affections.
But whom I yet love.â€ Poe writes:
And ever and anon amid her sobs
She murmured forth Castiglioneâ€™s name
. . . . she loves him still!
(1, 52-54)
When the Monk advises her to â€œthink of Cher] precious soul!â€ Lalage replies:
Think of my early days!
Think of my father
And mother in Heaven!
Think of our quiet home,
And the rivulet that ran before the door!
Think of my little sisters!â€”think of them!
(IV, 83-86)
Beauchamp in his Confessions (p. 90) wrote that Ann Cookâ€™s â€œfather, brothers and friends, by a most strange succession of calamities had been swept into the grave.â€
In Scene VII Politian confesses his love for Lalage in spite of â€œknowing what he knowsâ€ and â€œseeing what he has seen.â€ He loves her for her â€œbeautyâ€ and her â€œwoes.â€ She reminds him that her â€œseared and blighted nameâ€ would not tally â€œwith the ancestral honours of [his] house / And with [its] glory.â€ He answers that he loathes the name of glory and tells her that it does not matter they â€œgo down unhonoured and forgotten / Into the dustâ€”so [they] descend together.â€ She reminds him that â€œA deed is to be doneâ€” / Castiglione lives!â€ to which he replies that â€œhe shall die!â€ After some hesitation about the forthcoming death of Castiglione, she decides that â€œâ€”â€™tis very well!
/ So that the blade be keenâ€”the blow be sure.â€
Much of this scene is founded largely on fact; pages 74-75 of Ann Cookâ€™s Letters read:
. . . . He offered me his hand.
Yes, forlorn and abandoned as I was, he was willing to become my husband as he had been my friend.
What could I do?
I addressed him candidly and openly.
[page 26:]
â€˜You know my history,â€™ said I, â€˜and my shame, if you are willing to receive to your bosom a poor outcast, whom the world has stigmatised as guilty and polluted, with a wounded heart and a blighted name, then take me.
I am yours forever.â€™
â€˜My dear Ann,â€™ he replied, â€˜I regard you as the innocent victim of the most detestable treachery.... I have long admired the cultivation of your mind, and the proud dignity and elevation of your soul You were calculated to grace the most elevated circles of society . . . . I am proud to be the object of your choice, humbled as you may be in your estimation, or . . . . in that of an unfeeling world. . . . my attachment is deep, sincere, and ardent, and while we live it shall never become extinct. . . . .â€™
A reporter for the Lexington Kentucky Reporter of July 7, 1826, recorded Beauchampâ€™s farewell to his dying wife as follows: â€œâ€˜Farewell,â€™ said he, â€˜child of sorrowâ€” Farewell child of misfortune and persecutionâ€”you are now secure from the tongue of slanderâ€”for you I have lived; for you I die.â€™â€ Poe could have read this newspaper article, for it was quoted in an appendix to the Confession.
And Poeâ€™s Politian says: â€œAnd life shall then be mine, for I will live / For Thee, and in shine eyesâ€” and Thou shalt be / No more a mournerâ€”â€ (VII, 7880).
Much of Scene IX, in which Politian seeks out Castiglione to engage him in a duel, thus to avenge the grievous wrong Castiglione has done Lalage, follows very closely Beauchampâ€™s description in his Confession ( pp. 15-17) of an encounter with Colonel Sharp.
Politian (drawing) says: â€œThus to the expiatory tomb, / Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee / In the name of Lalage!â€ (59-61).
Castiglione replies: â€œHold off thy handâ€”with that beloved name / So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee / I cannotâ€”dare notâ€ (66-69).
In his Confession (p. 15) Beauchamp wrote: â€œColonel Sharp, I have come deputed and sent by her, to take your life.... Will you fight me a duel?â€ To which, according to Beauchamp, Sharp replied, â€œMy dear friend I cannot fight you, on account of Miss Cook.... I never can fight the friend of that worthy injured lady.â€
In the play Castiglione falls upon his knees at the feet of Politian and says â€œAlas!
my lord, / It isâ€”it isâ€” most true.
In such a cause / I am the veriest coward.
O pity me!â€ (72-73).
Beauchamp, thinking that Sharp was about to run, sprang forward, caught him by the breast of his coat, and said, â€œNow you damnâ€™d villain, you shall die.â€ Sharp then fell on his knees and said, â€œMy life is in your hands, my friend I beg my life.
Spare it for mercyâ€™s sake.â€ Beauchamp then records that he said â€œ. . . . tomorrow I shall horsewhip you in the streets, and repeat it daily till you fight me a duel.... You are about such a whining coward, as I was told you were.â€ In lines 85-90 Politian says:
Think not to fly me thus.
Do thou prepare
For public insult in she streetsâ€”before
The eves of the citizens.
Iâ€™ll follow theeâ€”
Like an avenging spirit Iâ€™ll follow thee
Even unto death.
Before those whom thou lovestâ€”
Before all Rome Iâ€™ll taunt thee, villainâ€”
[column 2:]
The final scene (XI), â€œInterior of the Coliseum,â€ is comprised almost entirely of Poeâ€™s poem The Coliseum which Poe incorporated into the play as a soliloquy said by Politian.
After the soliloquy Lalage enters â€œwildlyâ€ and informs Politian that â€œthe hour is come / For vengeance or will neverâ€ (55-56) for Alessandra and Castiglione (the bride and bridegroom) are now at the altar rail.
The again-aroused Politian swears that â€œBy the God of Heaven / Iâ€™ll mar this bridal if at the altarâ€™s foot / The bridegroom dies,â€ and dashes out (60-61).
Mabbott (I, 297) suggests that Poe seems here to recall something on page 84 of Ann Cookâ€™s Letters where she wrote, â€œI suggested that it would be better to plunge the dagger into his heart while folded in the arms of her for whom he deserted me.â€ He further suggests (p. 298) that in Â¢he final speech of Poeâ€™s play when Lalage says: â€œFarewell Castiglione and farewell / My hope in Heaven!â€ (62-64), she (unlike her prototype in real life) repents, although too late.
Poe continued an interest in the Beauchamp-Sharp case well after he abandoned his play based on it, for he commented several times on the theme as it was treated by some of his contemporaries.
In a review of William Gilmore Simmsâ€™ Beauchampe (1842) in Grahamâ€™s Magazine, 20 (May 1842), 320, Poe wrote:
The events upon which this novel is based are but too real.
No more thrilling, no more romantic tragedy did ever the brain of poet conceive than was the tragedy of Sharpe [sic] and Beauchampe [sic].
We are not sure that the author of â€˜Border Eaglesâ€™ has done right in the selection of his theme.
Too little has been left for invention.
We are sure, however, that the theme is skillfully handled.
In a review of Simmsâ€™ The Wigwam and the Cabin in the Broadway Journal, 2 (October 4, 1845), 190, Poe wrote â€œâ€˜Beauchampeâ€™ is intensely interesting; but the historical truth has somewhat hampered and repressed the natural strength of the artist.â€ Charles Fenno Hoffman wrote Greyslaer ( 1840), and in his Literati article on Hoffman in Godeyâ€™s Ladyâ€™s Book, 33 (October 1846), 157, Poe commented:
. . . . Greyslaer followed a romance based on a well known murder of Sharp, the Solicitor General of Kentucky, by Beauchampe [sic].
W. Gilmore Simms . . . . has treated the subject more effectively in his novel â€˜Beauchampeâ€™, but the fact is that both gentlemen have positively failed, as might have been expected . . . . The real events were more impressive than the fictitious ones.
The facts of this remarkable tragedy, as arranged by actual circumstances, would put to shame the skill of the consummate artist. . . . The incidents might be better woven into a tragedy. . . .

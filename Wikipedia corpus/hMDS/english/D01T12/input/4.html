        of Irish art</a>, and a world-famous example of <a href="early-christian-art.htm">early 
        Christian art</a>, the Book of Kells (<i>Leabhar Cheanannais</i>) is the 
        most famous of the <a href="illuminated-manuscripts.htm">illuminated manuscripts</a>, 
        produced by Irish monks about 800 CE. Also known as the Book of Columba, 
        or the Gospel of Colum Cille, the Book of Kells includes the four Gospels 
        of the New Testament written in Latin, decorated with innumerable illuminations, 
        illustrations and miniature images in a blaze of colour. Although unfinished, 
        it is a wonderful example of <a href="/web/20160325144512/http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/medieval-christian-artworks.htm">medieval 
        Christian art</a> and one of the best surviving examples of the Hiberno-Saxon 
        style or Insular art. It is on permanent display at <a href="/web/20160325144512/http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/irish-art-organizations/trinity-college-dublin.htm">Trinity 
        College Dublin Library</a> in Ireland. The name &quot;Book of Kells&quot; 
        comes from the Abbey of Kells in <a href="/web/20160325144512/http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/ireland-art-and-culture/meath.htm">County 
        Meath</a>, Ireland, where it was preserved during medieval times. When 
        was the Book of Kells written, where was it written, and who was the author 
        of the manuscript? These questions remain the subject of considerable 
        debate among scholars of <a href="monastic-irish-art.htm">monastic Irish 
        art</a>, and there are a number of theories. According to the most widely 
        accepted explanation, the Book of Kells was created at the monastery in 
        Iona, and illuminated by at least four different artist-monks, whose names 
        are lost to history. Other art scholars have suggested that the manuscript 
        may have been produced at Lindisfarne (Holy Island) off the coast of Northumberland, 
        then moved to Iona and thence to Kells. Or lastly, it may have been produced

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The greatest achievement of Irish <a href="/web/20160325144512/http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/medieval-art.htm">medieval 
        art</a>, the Book of Kells, was formerly held to be earlier than the <a href="lindisfarne-gospels.htm">Lindisfarne 
        Gospels</a> (which are dated approximately from 700 CE) but is now generally 
        assigned to the late eighth or early ninth century. It can only have been 
        made in one of two places: Iona or Kells. It seems probable, though, that 
        due to its resemblances to the Lindisfarne Gospels it was at least begun 
        at Iona (a traditional centre of holy learning and illumination, from 
        where Saint Columba launched his mission to Christianize Scotland and 
        where he was later buried), the base from which Lindisfarne had been colonized 
        about the year 635. Unfortunately, <a href="/web/20160325144512/http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/ancient-art/viking.htm">Vikings</a> 
        frequently raided the island, burning the monastery and killing the monks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 804, after two Viking raids, the monks 
        of Iona fled from their exposed island monastery to Meath, in Ireland. 
        They obtained a grant of land at Cenannus (Kells) and established there 
        the metropolis of the Columban Order. But they regretted abandoning Iona 
        and made various attempts to resettle there, carrying with them the sacred 
        objects and books of the monastery. Finally in 849 all were brought back 
        to Kells, the great manuscript probably with them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That the manuscript was at Kells two centuries 
        later we know from an entry in the <i>Annals of Ulster</i> (1007). And 
        as it is hardly probable that such a work should have been begun during 
        the troubled years between 804 and 849 (and since most of its <a href="/web/20160325144512/http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/definitions/decorative-art.htm">decorative 
        art</a> points to a date within the eighth century) it is reasonable to 
        assume that an important part of it had been produced in the scriptorium 
        of Iona before the Viking raids drove the monks to Meath. In any case 
        the most probable date of the Book of Kells is between 760-804 and 815-20; 
        and it is likely that different painters were working at it for several 
        years. Again, in view of A. M. Friend's evidence that in its Canon Tables 
        and Evangelist portraits it has borrowed motifs from the continental Ada 
        Group, these elements must be dated at the earliest about the close of 
        the eighth century.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The removal of the Book of Kells - along 
          with the relics of Saint Columba - to the Irish mainland, failed to 
          secure its safety. In 1007, it was seized by Vikings who plundered its 
          jewelled cover. It was later unearthed in a ditch, miraculously intact 
          with only a few sections missing.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After the surrender of the monastery of 
        Kells to the Crown by Abbot Richard Plunket in 1539, the manuscript passed 
        into the hands of one Geralde Plunket of Dublin, possibly a relative of 
        the abbot, and from Plunket to James Ussher; a highly versatile and accomplished 
        scholar of the day, and one of the earliest students of Trinity College, 
        Dublin. Finally the manuscript passed with Ussher's library to Trinity 
        College, where it is today.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the beginning of the eleventh century 
        the book belonged to the church of Kells and was called &quot;the great 
        gospel of Colum-Cille.&quot; This was supposed to be because, the book 
        was written and illuminated during the time of Saint Columba (Saint Columcille) 
        (c.521-97), perhaps even by Columba himself. However, when it is said 
        that the Book of Kells may have been <i>written</i> by Columba it is not 
        meant that he was also the <i>artist</i> from whose pen the elaborate 
        ornamentation of the volume proceeded. Columba was reputed to have been 
        a most industrious, indeed almost fanatical, scribe. But the scribe and 
        the illuminator were seldom the same person. The illuminations were frequently 
        executed much later than the manuscript itself and the original plan of 
        the Book of Kells was apparently so vast that it could not be completed 
        in a short time. The spaces to be decorated were left blank by the scribe. 
        Several painters, possibly at different periods, were employed to fill 
        them; there are, indeed, still to be seen some pages where the ornaments 
        of the framework are unfinished, being only partially sketched in outline.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that 
        Columba even wrote the script, since paleographic research shows that 
        the style of Latin script used did not emerge until well after his death. 
        In response, some experts in <a href="/web/20160325144512/http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/irish-art-guide.htm">Irish Art</a> 
        consider it may have been created in 797, to celebrate the 200th anniversary 
        of Saint Columba's death.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Four Illuminators or Artists</b><br>
          The scholar Francoise Henry believes that among the several artists 
          who may have worked on the illumination at different periods four are 
          readily identifiable on stylistic grounds. One artist, she feels, was 
          obviously entrusted with the cruciform cover page known as &quot;the 
          page of the eight circles&quot;, the great Chi-Rho, and the initial 
          page of each of the gospels, except the Quoniam. She sees in him &quot;the 
          goldsmith&quot;, someone familiar with work in precious metals, in enamel 
          and in niello. The delicacy of his work is impressive, as is his interest 
          in asymmetry. Francoise Henry recognizes another individualist in the 
          portraitist of the three Evangelists, the page composed of square frames, 
          and the Quoniam at the beginning of the Gospel of Saint Luke. The third 
          is the &quot;illustrator&quot;, the author of the Virgin and Child, 
          the Tunc Crucifixerat, and the Temptation. Finally, a fourth artist 
          is responsible for many less important contributions. For more, see: 
          <i>Irish Art in the early Christian Period</i> (Methuen, London, 1940)

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> <a name="comparison"></a>How the Book 
        of Kells Compares With Other Manuscripts</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The script employed in the Book of Kells 
        is the beautiful round uncial of all the best Irish manuscripts. It differs 
        little in that feature from the <a href="book-of-durrow.htm">Book of Durrow</a>. 
        But here their similarities cease. The scale of the Book of Kells is different 
        from that of the Book of Durrow, and the mood of its expression is vastly 
        different: the calm, meticulous distinction of the earlier book gives 
        way to a flamboyant, magnificent exuberance; there is nothing of that 
        constrained perfection of order and organization - inherited from the 
        <a href="cathach-of-st-columba.htm">Cathach of Saint Columba</a> (c.610-20) 
        - which mark both the Book of Durrow and the Lindisfarne Gospels.<br>
        <br>
        No manuscript we have seen before approaches the Book of Kells for elaborate 
        ornamentation. Each of the Gospels was prefaced with three pages of full-length 
        decoration - a depiction of the Evangelists' symbol, a portrait of the 
        Evangelist himself, and an Initial Page. In addition, there were extra 
        pages of decoration at two key passages in the text, the incarnation of 
        Christ and the Crucifixion. Last and most unusual of all, a series of 
        narrative illustrations were planned, three of which have survived.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition, the cover pages have a cruciform 
        composition, followed by a series of porticos framing the Canon Tables. 
        The carpet pages of pure ornament of the Book of Durrow are replaced in 
        the Book of Kells by cruciform pages bearing the symbols of the Evangelists 
        and the same symbols, disposed in various ways over and under the arcades, 
        give the Canon Tables a fantastic appearance. The Chi-Rho introducing 
        the Genealogy of Christ in Saint Matthew is ornamented as richly as the 
        initial pages of the gospels.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A continuous chain of ornamentation runs 
        through the text. The capitals at the beginning of each paragraph - two, 
        three, four to a page - are made of brightly coloured entwinements of 
        birds, snakes, distorted men and quadrupeds, fighting or performing all 
        sorts of acrobatic feats. Other animals wander about the pages between 
        the lines or on top of them. In addition, one of the most striking and 
        unusual features of the Book of Kells is this profusion of animated capitals, 
        a feature of Irish illumination which may owe its origin to the ornamented 
        letters ending in coiled <a href="celtic-spirals-designs.htm">Celtic spirals</a> 
        in the Book of Durrow.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="designs"></a>Eastern Influence 
        on the Design of the Book of Kells</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oriental and particularly Coptic influence 
        is generally recognized throughout the Book of Kells - Coptic clearly 
        in the group of red dots on the robes of the Evangelists Mark and John. 
        Furthermore, the figure of the Virgin and Child seated on a throne surrounded 
        by attending angels appears frequently in Coptic art. Francoise Henry 
        points out a striking analogy between the the Virgin and Child page and 
        a ninth-century Coptic manuscript in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New 
        York (Catalogue of the Manuscripts of the Pierpont Morgan Collection). 
        It is true that the Coptic manuscripts are all, so far as is known, later 
        than the Irish. But Coptic manuscripts of the ninth to the fourteenth 
        centuries were evidently based on a well-established ancient tradition 
        originating in the sixth (or even the fifth) century. This assumption 
        is supported by an early Coptic binding with a decorative arrangement 
        of broad ribbons and crosses which suggest the existence in the sixth 
        century of full pages of ribbon interlacing. The later Coptic manuscripts 
        which we know probably embody many archaic elements. But it would appear 
        that there must have been a direct connexion between early Irish Christianity 
        and the tradition of <a href="/web/20160325144512/http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/byzantine.htm">Byzantine 
        art</a> decoration seen in the monasteries of Egypt, as well as the highly 
        orientalized Greek Christianity of the south-east Mediterranean.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="illuminations"></a>Illuminations 
        in the Book of Kells</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For all the wealth and variety Irish manuscript 
        illumination has to offer, it is the Book of Kells that is generally recognized 
        as the supreme achievement in this field.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="evangelistsymbols"></a>Symbols 
        of the Evangelists</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The emphasis placed on the Evangelists' 
        symbols was unprecedented. In addition to the traditional symbol pages 
        at the start of the Gospels, they featured in the Canon Tables, the portraits 
        and other prefatory sections. They were also used in a number of different 
        ways - sometimes as ornamental motifs, sometimes as heraldic beasts, and 
        sometimes as potent talismans. As such, they underwent a variety of transformations. 
        In one instance, a peacock's tail becomes attached to a lion's head while, 
        in another, the eagle of St John holds the Gospel in a human hand. Only 
        two of the portraits have survived, providing one of the weaker aspects 
        of the decoration, but the four Initial Pages are superb. In each case, 
        the first letter runs the full length of the page, and the words themselves 
        are completely indecipherable to the untutored eye. Instead, the <a href="/web/20160325144512/http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/calligraphy.htm">calligraphy</a> 
        becomes a pretext for a dazzling display of spiral and interlace patterns 
        from <a href="la-tene-celtic-culture.htm">La Tene Celtic art</a> designs. 
        It also offers the artist an opportunity to exercise his imagination to 
        the full. On the St John's page, for example, the letters 'c' and 'i' 
        are transformed into a man playing a harp while, on the St Luke's page, 
        the characters 'iam' merge together to become an instrument of torture.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The decoration on the pages which mark 
        the incarnation of Christ is even more spectacular. The format of the

        is similar to the examples in the Lindisfarne and Lichfield manuscripts, 
        but the sheer profusion of detail is astonishing. Hidden away among the 
        loops and spirals, there are vignettes of cats and mice fighting over 
        a communion wafer, an otter clutching a fish, and a row of angels displaying 
        the Gospels. In most other manuscripts, the Monogram Page provides the 
        sole decoration at this point but, in the Book of Kells, the incarnation 
        passage is commemorated with two other illustrations. There is a splendid 
        Carpet Page - the only one in the Kells' manuscript - and a portrait of 
        Christ. The latter was a great rarity in Insular manuscripts, as was the 
        notion of adding decoration to the Crucifixion passage. Sadly, this is 
        one of the sections of the book that was never completed. There is an 
        ornamental Initial Page, but this faces a blank sheet where, doubtless, 
        a depiction of the Crucifixion was planned.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The narrative illustrations hint at a new 
        'figurative' direction in Celtic art. With their preference for abstract 
        or stylized forms, Celtic craftsmen usually shied away from themes of 
        this kind and only a few, isolated examples can be found in the earlier 
        Gospel Books. Here, there are three, and it seems likely that the complete 
        manuscript would have included several more. The surviving illustrations 
        depict the <i>Temptation of Christ</i>, the <i>Arrest</i>, and the <i>Virgin 
        and Child</i>. The latter is particularly interesting, partly because 
        it is the earliest-known version of this subject in an Insular manuscript, 
        and partly because it demonstrates the hesitancy of an artist working 
        in an unfamiliar genre. The figures of the Virgin, the Infant Christ and 
        the attendant angels were probably borrowed from an Eastern icon, but 
        they sit uneasily beside the more obviously Celtic elements - the writhing 
        beasts in the border, the beard-tuggers in the semicircular insets, and 
        the savage head on the back of the Virgin's throne.</font></p>

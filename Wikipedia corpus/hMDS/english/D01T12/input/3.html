                  <p>&#9;Throughout all of art history, one of the most distinct 
                    styles and types has been that of the Irish, or Celtic art. 
                    Celtic art is set apart from other kinds of art based upon 
                    the heavy use of the various knotwork patterns and designs, 
                    by the usage of the colors violet, brown, yellow, blue and 
                    green, and particularly in the Book of Kells, the angular 
                    runic styles of font. And perhaps the most representative 
                    piece of Celtic and Irish art is the Book of Kells, an ornately 
                    decorated, very unique copy of the New Testament of the Bible. 
                    The Book of Kells has become such a national symbol and so 
                    a part of the Irish culture that it even appears on the Irish 
                    currency. What is curious and interesting about all this, 
                    is that twelve hundred years after it is known that the Book 
                    has been in existence, there is still controversy over its 
                    exact origins. In this paper the history of the Book of Kells 
                    will be examined, as well as the materials used to make the 
                    Book. </p>
                  <p>&#9;To this day there is still debate and controversy over 
                    where exactly the highly considered Irish, Book of Kells originates 
                    from. The theories of present are that the Book of Kells was 
                    created in either Kells, an island between Ireland and Scotland 
                    called Iona, or from a church in Northumberland. Another theory 
                    says that it may have been begun in Iona, but finished in 
                    Kells. While no one can be precisely sure where it was created<font size=2>, 
                    </font>the calligraphy and illuminations can all be traced 
                    to Ireland and its Gaelic past. Something that is known for 
                    sure is that the monks who created the Book of Kells were 
                    Columban monks, who were originally from Iona, but had relocated 
                    to Kells by the early 9<sup>th</sup> century, the same time 
                    that the Book of Kells was known to have first appeared. From 
                    this time to 1653 the Book of Kells was actually in Kells 
                    until it was decided that it ought to be moved to Dublin for 
                    safe-keeping. Then in 1661 the Book was given to Trinity College 
                    Library and has been on display there since the mid-19th century. 
                  </p>
                  <p>&#9;The Book of Kells is in fact a copy of the New Testament 
                    of the Bible. Its pages, or as they are called, folios are 
                    made from vellum. Vellum is made from the skin of calves, 
                    sheep or less frequently, goat kids, but in the case of the 
                    Book of Kells, calfskin was predominantly used. Completing 
                    all the folios of the Book of Kells required the skins of 
                    more than 185 calves. </p>
                  <p>&#9;The colors of the inks used in the Book of Kells are 
                    not only of wide variety, but there are many shades of the 
                    present colors made from many different techniques from many 
                    different materials. The basic pigments used to write and 
                    illustrate the Book of Kells are yellow, red, green, purple, 
                    blue, brown, black, and white. One of the main, and most important 
                    pigments of yellow used in the Book of Kells is orpiment, 
                    the other, though less used shade yellow came from yellow 
                    ochre, which is a naturally occurring mineral. The foremost 
                    red color used comes from the inorganic pigment from red lead, 
                    and the other red ink comes from, like the yellow, red ochre. 
                    The green shades used in the Book of Kells comes from a copper 
                    pigment, to be exact the mineral malachite. However, not all 
                    the copper used in the Book of Kells came from this naturally 
                    occurring mineral, but from artificially produced green copper. 
                    Another, more dull green color that was used is veragut, which 
                    is mixed from the yellow orpiment, and the blue indigo. </p>
                  <p>&#9;There are several shades of purple used in the Book of 
                    Kells, brownish purple, deep red purple, and bluish purple, 
                    this last one was often mixed with white ink to create pink 
                    and mauve. There are several materials that the purple dyes 
                    were made from, they include the purple shellfish, <i>folium 
                    </i>from Crozophora, dye from elderberries, blueberries, brazil 
                    wood, and also from various lichens. Another color of which 
                    there are many shades in the Book of Kells is blue, which 
                    has four separate shades used, very light blue, azure, dark 
                    blue, and greenish blue. This last shade comes from indigo 
                    from the <i>Imdigofera tinctura</i> L plant. The other three 
                    shades are made from mixtures, in different particular ratios 
                    of lapis lazuli which could only be obtained from Afghanistan 
                    of Persia, indigo, and chalk. </p>
                  <p>&#9;The brown color used, an iron gall ink, was made from 
                    crushed oak galls and sulfite of iron suspended in a mixture 
                    of gum and water. The black ink that is used throughout the 
                    Book of Kells was created from lamp black, or from soot, and 
                    sometimes soot from burned bones. </p>
                  <p>&#9;The Book of Kells is one of the most beautiful, intricate 
                    and ornate documents in existence. It originated twelve hundred 
                    years ago, most likely in Iona, a small island between Scotland 
                    and Ireland, and was soon moved to the town of Kells in Ireland. 
                    After spending eight hundred and fifty years there it moved 
                    to Dublin, and shortly after that to its current home in the 
                    Trinity College Library where it was put on display and can 
                    still be seen today. Many different types of dyes were used 
                    to create the artwork, or illumination of the Book of Kells, 
                    and they came from many different sources, several of which 
                    were very far from where the book was created. It took lots 
                    of precise and painstaking work to create and it truly sets 
                    off and defines Celtic art. </p>

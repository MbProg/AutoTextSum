        <h2>The Napoleonic Wars and Brazilian Independence</h2>
        <p><b>By <a href="mailto:dalepappas@comcast.net">Dale Pappas</a></b></p>
        <p>By 1807, many of Europe&rsquo;s monarchs had waged war on Revolutionary,
          and later Napoleonic France.&nbsp; Several ancient and prominent royal
          families, including the Hapsburgs and the Hohenzollerns, had experienced
          the humiliation of defeat that resulted from these conflicts against
          skilled French forces.&nbsp; Often times, Napoleon himself, at the
          head of his victorious armies, entered Europe&rsquo;s capitals and
          sat on the very thrones occupied for centuries by those royal families.
          However, one capital that Napoleon had not taken was London, although
          it had long been an aim of the French emperor&rsquo;s to decisively
          defeat France&rsquo;s traditional foe.&nbsp; Britain and France had
          waged war on one another frequently, vying for valuable colonial possessions
          in order to establish powerful empires.&nbsp; The Treaty of Paris,
          which concluded the Seven Years&rsquo; War in 1763, gave Britain much
          of France&rsquo;s overseas territory. In the years that followed, France
          anxiously awaited an opportunity to weaken the British Empire, and
          experienced moderate success in the American War of Independence.&nbsp; The
          major chance to deliver a blow to British prestige came with the outbreak
          of the Napoleonic Wars, which largely became a struggle between Britain
          and France for superiority. Eager to defeat the British, Napoleon explored
          several bold invasion attempts. The invasion schemes though were thwarted
          while still in development, which led Napoleon to wage economic war
          on his principle rival by implementing the Continental System.</p>
        <p>The Continental System aimed to block British goods from entering
          other European ports, which would strengthen France&rsquo;s control
          of the continent.&nbsp; Napoleon&rsquo;s continental blockade was extended
          following his victories in 1806 and 1807, leaving only Sweden and Portugal
          out of his reach.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          Napoleon planned to cut Britain off from its loyal ally, Portugal,
          by ordering the ruling Braganza family to accept the Continental System,
          or be deposed. He decided to invade Portugal along with his ally Spain,
          led by the ambitious prime minister, Manuel de Godoy.&nbsp; Napoleon
          agreed to partition Portugal between himself, Godoy, and the King of
          Etruria (Tuscany).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title="">[2]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          An ultimatum was sent to the Portuguese ordering the closure of all
          ports to British goods by 1 September 1807 or else Lisbon would be
          seized and the Braganzas deposed.&nbsp; With little hope of defeating
          a French invasion, Portuguese ministers, including Antonio de Ara&uacute;jo,
          considered the relocation of the monarchy to the colony of Brazil the
          best possible option.&nbsp; The Prince Regent, the future Dom Jo&atilde;o
          VI of Portugal consented, and the royal family and nearly 10000 others
          boarded ships for their mysterious possession, Brazil.&nbsp; The decision
          to transfer the monarchy crushed the remnants of one of Europe&rsquo;s
          oldest empires, but gave birth to a new power across the Atlantic.</p>
        <p><b>Portugal and Dom Jo&atilde;o VI</b></p>
        <p>By the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, the influence of the Portuguese
          Empire had declined significantly.&nbsp; Although Portugal still possessed
          valuable colonies, including Brazil, the once formidable Iberian kingdom
          was dependent on Great Britain.&nbsp; The British were not only valuable
          to Portugal economically, but their powerful military also provided
          protection from neighboring Spain.&nbsp; Portugal had been allied to
          Britain in several 18<sup>th</sup> century conflicts, including the
          First Coalition against Revolutionary France.&nbsp; By 1797 though,
          France had begun to pressure the Portuguese to break their alliance
          with Britain.&nbsp; However, with British backing, the Portuguese refused
          to accept France&rsquo;s demands.&nbsp; When Napoleon was made First
          Consul, he encouraged Spain to attack Portugal, their traditional enemy.&nbsp; In
          1801, Spanish troops led by Manuel de Godoy invaded Portugal and seized
          several border towns in what became known as the &ldquo;War of the
          Oranges.&rdquo;&nbsp; In addition to territorial loss, Portugal was
          forced to close its ports to British goods until peace was made in
          1803 and trade between the two resumed.&nbsp; However, it would not
          be the last time Portugal was threatened by France and Spain. </p>
        <p>The Portuguese kingdom at the outbreak of the French Revolution was
          ruled by Queen Maria I.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the executions of the
          French king, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette terrified Queen Maria to
          the point where she lost her mind.&nbsp; The mentally ill queen was
          replaced by her son, the Prince of Brazil Dom Jo&atilde;o, who ruled
          Portugal as Prince Regent from 1792.&nbsp; Jo&atilde;o was largely
          considered a disappointment within his family compared to his older
          brother, who died before he could ascend the throne.&nbsp; As a result,
          the throne passed to Jo&atilde;o, who contrary to popular belief at
          the time, was capable of managing his kingdom.&nbsp; The Prince Regent
          was affable, intelligent, and good-natured, which was a pleasant surprise
          to foreign diplomats.&nbsp; Despite being overweight, Jo&atilde;o was
          an avid hunter and sportsmen until he suffered a leg injury.&nbsp; His
          wife, the diminutive and devious Spanish princess, Carlota Joaquina
          shared his love of sport, but nothing else.&nbsp; She was cold toward
          her husband and for the most part, their children, with the exception
          of Dom Miguel.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          The ill-tempered Carlota Joaquina often considered deposing her husband
          with Spanish aid, especially while in Brazil.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>In addition to hunting, Dom Jo&atilde;o enjoyed visiting the palace
          and monastery at Mafra, outside Lisbon.&nbsp; He enjoyed the monks&rsquo; company
          as well as church music.&nbsp; Although he was content in partaking
          in religious ceremonies, Jo&atilde;o was destined to lead his kingdom
          in a difficult period in its history.&nbsp; Portugal&rsquo;s troubles
          at this time started with the outbreak of the French Revolution, and
          the onset of Queen Maria&rsquo;s illness.&nbsp; Dom Jo&atilde;o faced
          a dangerous situation, as he attempted to avoid war with aggressive
          Napoleonic France.&nbsp; Pressure from both France and Spain resulted
          in a policy of neutrality during the early years of the Napoleonic
          Wars.&nbsp; Napoleon accepted Portuguese neutrality for several years,
          until he implemented the Continental System in 1806.&nbsp; Portugal
          refused to turn against Britain, which led Napoleon to sign the treaty
          of San Ildefonso with Spain.&nbsp; The agreement effectively partitioned
          Portugal once it fell to an invading French army.&nbsp; Shortly after,
          French and Spanish officials presented an ultimatum to Portugal, which
          called for the closure of Portuguese ports to British goods, something
          Dom Jo&atilde;o refused to accept.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>The French Invasion and the Flight of the Royal Family 1807</b></p>
        <p>Portugal&rsquo;s opposition to the Continental System led Napoleon
          to order an invasion.&nbsp; General Androche Junot, the former French
          ambassador to Portugal, was dispatched to seize Lisbon and the Braganzas.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
          Portuguese ministers arranged for British aid to transfer the royal
          family to Brazil, and therefore save the kingdom.&nbsp; Dom Jo&atilde;o
          did not wish to end up like the lesser royal families of areas of Italy
          and Germany, who had lost their thrones for their opposition to Napoleon.
          The transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil was unprecedented as
          no monarch had ever visited the Americas, let alone established their
          capital there.&nbsp; The Braganzas&rsquo; arrival in Brazil marked
          a new era in Portuguese, Brazilian, and indeed Latin American history
          as a whole.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The court&rsquo;s transfer was also difficult. The Braganzas arranged
          to bring nearly everything but Queluz palace with them to Brazil.&nbsp; Remarkably
          many of their possessions, as well as over 10000 people, successfully
          boarded the ships and departed Lisbon before the arrival of the French.&nbsp; The
          entire royal family managed to escape before Junot&rsquo;s arrival
          and thus were spared the humiliation of defeat at the hands of Napoleon.&nbsp; The
          successful escape infuriated Napoleon, who was not used to monarchs
          defying his commands.&nbsp; He later remarked that Jo&atilde;o was &ldquo;the
          only one who ever tricked me.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Just hours after the royal family&rsquo;s departure on 29 November
          1807, the French army arrived in Lisbon.&nbsp; Junot took control of
          the government and announced the end of Braganza rule in Portugal.&nbsp; Unfortunately
          for the Frenchman, most Portuguese were opposed to his government and
          were pleased when British troops arrived to drive the French from Portugal.&nbsp; Unfortunately
          for the Portuguese, their country became the scene of a ferocious conflict
          between Britain and France.&nbsp; In the end, Britain held off several
          French invasions of Portugal.&nbsp; The British and the Portuguese
          parliament effectively ruled in place of Dom Jo&atilde;o until the
          royal family&rsquo;s return in 1821, but their Portuguese subjects
          would no longer welcome them. </p>
        <p><b>Colonial Brazil</b></p>
        <p>Although discovered in 1500, Brazil was not firmly under Portuguese
          authority until the late 1600s.&nbsp; In the early years following
          its discovery, the Portuguese showed little interest in developing
          their new American possession due to the existence of profitable colonies
          in Asia and Africa.&nbsp; Some Portuguese though began to obtain the
          valuable brazilwood from the territory, hence the name Brazil.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          However, these early Portuguese settlers found that they were not the
          only Europeans interested in brazilwood as the French had also arrived
          in the region.&nbsp; France&rsquo;s presence in Brazil led the Portuguese
          crown to take notice of their possession. In response, Portugal authorized
          several expeditions to explore and settle the vast expanse of land.&nbsp; In
          the 1520s and early 1530s, expeditions led by Martim Afonso de Sousa
          established settlements such as S&atilde;o Vicente and Piratininga
          (S&atilde;o Paulo).&nbsp; Following the establishment of settlements,
          the Portuguese crown created hereditary captaincies to govern the colony.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>However, these captaincies largely failed with the exception of two,
          S&atilde;o Vicente and Pernambuco. Their success was due in large part
          to sugar cane and the indigenous slave trade.&nbsp; The system&rsquo;s
          overall failure led to the formation of a central government, under
          a governor-general.&nbsp; The first man appointed to the position,
          Tom&eacute; de Sousa, established the capital at Salvador da Bahia,
          in northeastern Brazil.&nbsp; In the 17<sup>th</sup> century, Brazil
          was divided into two states, and two others were soon created.&nbsp; All
          four states were incorporated into the Viceroyalty of Brazil in 1763.</p>
        <p>By the 18<sup>th</sup> century, Portugal had recognized that Brazil
          was rich in natural resources, most importantly gold.&nbsp; Gold had
          been discovered early in the century in an inland area that became
          known as Minas Gerais, or General Mines.&nbsp; The overwhelming success
          of gold production led to a population boom in Minas.&nbsp; In response,
          the capital of the viceroyalty was moved to Rio de Janeiro to be closer
          to Minas Gerais and offer an outlet to the sea.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          The Portuguese benefited immensely from this gold, which made Brazil
          the new jewel of the empire.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Origins of Brazilian Independence: Inconfid&ecirc;ncia Mineira
          1789-1792 and the Revolution in Bahia 1798</b></p>
        <p>The successful revolution against Great Britain and the establishment
          of an American republic in the 1780s was unlike anything the modern
          world had yet seen.&nbsp; Less than a decade later, revolutionary fervor
          that had engulfed British North America arrived in Europe through the
          French Revolution.&nbsp; Many European monarchs had quietly supported
          the American Revolution because it weakened the British Empire.&nbsp; However,
          the revolution in France was too close for comfort for the monarchs
          of the anci&eacute;n regime.&nbsp; A coalition of nations, including
          Portugal was formed to defeat Revolutionary France.</p>
        <p>Queen Maria was one of many that were alarmed at the outbreak of the
          French Revolution.&nbsp; In addition to the onset of her insanity,
          the revolution also led the queen&rsquo;s government to crack down
          on liberal institutions.&nbsp; She believed that her Portuguese subjects
          would depose her and destroy the kingdom. The queen&rsquo;s fear of
          a revolt was realized; however it was some of her Brazilian subjects
          that were responsible.</p>
        <p>Gold production had declined by the late 18<sup>th</sup> century,
          which led to economic troubles for the population of Minas Gerais.&nbsp;
          The people of the region, known as Mineiros, were also plagued by heavy
          taxes in the gold mining area.&nbsp; Mineiros who mined diamonds, which
          were also present in the region, faced greater difficulties from the
          local administration.&nbsp; The top official, known as the Intendente
          dos Diamantes exercised complete authority over the mining industry
          in the region, which led many to despise the administration. Several
          wealthy young Mineiros, who had been educated abroad, embraced the
          ideals of the Age of Enlightenment as well as the American Revolution
          and planned to revolt against the harsh Portuguese administration.
          One man, Jos&eacute; Joaquim da Maia was inspired to rebel against
          Portugal upon his meeting American revolutionary Thomas Jefferson in
          Paris. Although Maia died before returning to Brazil, there were others
          who shared his passion to free his homeland from Portugal.</p>
        <p>The members of the conspiracy against Portuguese rule were inspired
          by French philosophers and the American Revolution.&nbsp; They planned
          to revolt once the government announced its plan to collect taxes and
          create a Brazilian republic, not unlike the young United States.&nbsp; The
          leader of what became known as the Inconfid&ecirc;ncia Mineira was
          Jos&eacute; da Silva Xavier, commonly known as Tiradentes or &ldquo;Tooth-puller&rdquo; because
          he briefly practiced dentistry.<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          Tiradentes, bearing a copy of the United States Constitution, traveled
          throughout Minas Gerais and even to Rio, to gain support for the movement.<a
href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          Unfortunately for members of the conspiracy, the local administration
          was quickly alerted and rounded up those involved, including Tiradentes.&nbsp; The
          leader&rsquo;s trial dragged on for two years, until he was finally
          convicted in Rio.&nbsp; The Portuguese, eager to send a message to
          the restless Brazilians, decided on a brutal fate for leader of the
          conspiracy.&nbsp; While the others were banished, Tiradentes received
          death by hanging.&nbsp; On 21 April 1792, Tiradentes was led to the
          gallows in Rio, and later his body was quartered.<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          Parts of his mutilated body were publicly displayed throughout Brazil,
          as a stern reminder of Portuguese authority.&nbsp; However, instead
          of discouraging another revolt, Tiradentes&rsquo; execution inspired
          future movements and made him a martyr and early symbol of Brazilian
          independence. </p>
        <p>In 1798, another revolt broke out in Salvador da Bahia. Unlike the
          Inconfid&ecirc;ncia Mineira, in which wealthy, educated men led the
          movement, the Bahia revolt involved the lower class and slaves.<a href="#_ftn10"
name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          The revolt, which had the potential to develop into a mass movement
          throughout the northeast, was quickly suppressed and the leaders were
          executed.&nbsp; Although these revolts were crushed, they clearly show
          that many Brazilians, especially Mineiros, much like their cousins
          in British North America had outgrown the rule of the mother country.&nbsp; Although
          this revolutionary sentiment was neutralized during the royal family&rsquo;s
          stay, it had not been completely eradicated.</p>
        <p><b>The Braganzas in Brazil 1808-1821</b></p>
        <p>The Atlantic crossing took roughly three months, and the royal family
          arrived in Salvador da Bahia on 22 January 1808.<a href="#_ftn11"
name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          Several days later, Jo&atilde;o opened Brazilian ports to friendly
          nations, mainly Great Britain, ending the mercantilist system that
          the Portuguese had instituted.&nbsp; Dom Jo&atilde;o introduced another
          favorable measure the following month, when the Portuguese court traveled
          to Rio de Janeiro.&nbsp; The city replaced Lisbon as the capital of
          the Portuguese empire.&nbsp; Portugal was quickly becoming a Brazilian
          colony.</p>
        <p>Dom Jo&atilde;o set out to transform Rio into a true capital, one
          that would rival any in Europe.&nbsp; During his years in Brazil, medical,
          military, and art schools were established.&nbsp; In addition, a bank
          was chartered, a new opera house was built, and a museum was founded.
          Also, the Royal Printing Press was established.&nbsp; Prior to this
          all books had to be shipped from Portugal.&nbsp; Newspapers also appeared
          throughout the royal family&rsquo;s stay, including the <i>Gazeta do
          Rio de Janeiro</i>.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          Papers helped to keep the public informed on the war across the Atlantic
          and other news from Europe.&nbsp; Other periodicals and journals gradually
          appeared, including <i>O Patriota</i>, edited by Manuel Ferreira de
          Ara&uacute;jo Guimar&atilde;es, which praised Dom Jo&atilde;o&rsquo;s
          efforts in Brazil.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          Trade flourished and manufacturing was permitted after a decree that
          prohibited it was revoked.&nbsp; The Braganzas&rsquo; arrival also
          led to a population increase.&nbsp; Rio&rsquo;s population in 1808
          numbered around 60000.&nbsp; By 1818, the city&rsquo;s population had
          swelled to 130000.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          Although Rio and indeed the rest of Brazil benefited from the royal
          family&rsquo;s presence, all was not well.</p>
        <p>Dom Jo&atilde;o had taken an immediate liking to life in Brazil, however
          his wife had not. It was no secret that Carlota Joaquina despised her
          husband and her new life across the Atlantic.&nbsp; Despite the cultural
          reforms, she still viewed Brazilian society as primitive and longed
          to return to Europe.&nbsp; If she could not return to Europe though,
          Carlota Joaquina had an alternative; she would establish her own kingdom
          from Spanish territory with Buenos Aires as the capital.&nbsp; The
          idea was supported by British Admiral Sir Sidney Smith, who was in
          Brazil directing a campaign against French Guiana.<a href="#_ftn15"
name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</span></span></span></a> Her nephew, Don Pedro
          Carlos was also considered as a possible ruler of Spanish territory
          in South America.&nbsp; However, the plan never materialized and Carlota
          Joaquina remained unhappily in Brazil. </p>
        <p>Family quarrels were only the beginning of Dom Jo&atilde;o&rsquo;s
          troubles.&nbsp; Political upheaval in both Brazil and Portugal threatened
          Braganza rule.&nbsp; Tension both in Europe and America stemmed from
          the royal family&rsquo;s absolute power, as many called for a constitutional
          monarchy.&nbsp; In Brazil, a secret organization was formed in 1814,
          which resurrected the idea of a republic.&nbsp; The revolt that followed
          originated in Pernambuco and gained the support of different classes
          and the clergy.&nbsp; The uprising quickly spread throughout the northeast.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          However, after a brief fight, the leaders were executed and the revolt
          was suppressed.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in Portugal liberals were opposed to Dom Jo&atilde;o&rsquo;s
          policies in Brazil.&nbsp; Many Portuguese felt that they had been neglected
          by the Prince Regent as many of his measures favored Brazil. The Portuguese
          were aware of the enormous growth of the Brazilian economy, notably
          in Rio. The emergence of Rio as a productive and impressive capital
          upset many Portuguese, who felt that Dom Jo&atilde;o had forsaken his
          homeland.&nbsp; They were further angered when Brazil was elevated
          to the status of kingdom in 1815. The measure permitted the election
          of Brazilians to the Portuguese Parliament, known as the Cortes.&nbsp; However,
          the fact that the former colony was now equal in status to the ancient
          Portuguese kingdom was too much for the Portuguese to bear. As a result,
          The Portuguese in the Cortes were hostile toward the Brazilian representatives,
          which caused tension between the two kingdoms.&nbsp; The royal family&rsquo;s
          troubles continued following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, when the
          Portuguese demanded their return.&nbsp; In addition, Portuguese liberals
          demanded the creation of a constitutional monarchy.&nbsp; Jo&atilde;o,
          the new King of Portugal Brazil and the Algarve hesitated to return
          to Portugal until he learned of the outbreak of the Liberal Revolution
          of 1820, which originated in the city of Porto. </p>
        <p>Revolutionaries in Brazil also attempted to get their own constitutional
          reforms.&nbsp; A National Convention met under the leadership of Luiz
          Duprat, which attempted to introduce a radical constitution.&nbsp; However,
          the movement was crushed when the young prince and heir to the Portuguese
          throne, Dom Pedro ordered the convention building stormed and Duprat
          jailed.<a
href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          By the spring of 1821, tension in both Brazil and Portugal forced the
          King to act.&nbsp; He reluctantly decided to return to Portugal, leaving
          Dom Pedro in Brazil.&nbsp; It would be the last time King Jo&atilde;o
          would see the country that he had come to love.</p>
        <p><b>Dom Pedro and Independence 1821-1822</b></p>
        <p>The man that would play a key role in obtaining Brazilian independence,
          and who would consequently become emperor was Dom Pedro.&nbsp; The
          young crown prince was only nine when he left Portugal in 1807, so
          he had grown up like his other siblings in Brazil.&nbsp; Dom Pedro
          largely did what he pleased as a child, as he was not formerly educated.&nbsp; He
          came to regret his lack of formal schooling at the end of his life
          and made sure that his children, including the future Dom Pedro II
          were rigorously instructed.</p>
        <p>In his teen years, Dom Pedro was a handsome, daring young man who
          was known for his affairs with the wives of prominent officials.&nbsp;
          Although most of his romantic adventures were kept quiet, one threatened
          to undermine the royal family&rsquo;s honor.&nbsp; Pedro&rsquo;s affair
          with the young French ballerina, No&eacute;mi Thierry was the talk
          of Rio&rsquo;s coffeehouses. Despite the commotion, Dom Jo&atilde;o&rsquo;s
          court ignored the rumors until it was found that Thierry was pregnant.&nbsp; While
          this event was unfolding, Jo&atilde;o was in the process of arranging
          a marriage for Pedro to a European princess.<a href="#_ftn18"
name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          He feared that if news of Pedro&rsquo;s latest affair crossed the Atlantic,
          powerful royal families, notably the Hapsburgs, would decline the offer.&nbsp; Pedro
          was persuaded to end his relationship with the French ballerina, although
          it was quite costly for the kingdom as Thierry received a large sum
          of money.&nbsp; In May of 1817, Pedro was married by proxy to Leopoldina
          of the House of Hapsburg.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Pedro briefly halted his romantic escapades to become acquainted with
          his new wife and to deal with the political troubles of both Portugal
          and Brazil.&nbsp; King Jo&atilde;o was unable to exercise any authority
          in Portugal, as the liberals held power in the Cortes.&nbsp; The Cortes
          was extremely hostile towards Brazil, and even returned its status
          to that of a colony.&nbsp; This was a measure that Brazilians, including
          Pedro could not accept.&nbsp; In the summer of 1821, Portuguese troops,
          known as the Legion took power in Rio under their commander General
          Jorge de Avilez.&nbsp; The Portuguese government ordered Pedro to return
          to Portugal, but the crown prince defied the command on what became
          known as the Dia do Fico, meaning, &ldquo;I will remain.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The Legion was not pleased by Pedro&rsquo;s answer to the government.&nbsp; If
          the crown prince would not go to Lisbon on his own, he would be sent
          there by force.&nbsp; In January of 1822, General de Avilez dispatched
          his troops to seize Pedro and send him to Portugal.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
          Pedro prepared a force of his own to confront the Portuguese troops.&nbsp; The
          two armies met outside of Rio, but neither side wished to attack the
          other.&nbsp; After a brief but tense standoff, de Avilez withdrew his
          men to their fortifications, with Pedro in pursuit.&nbsp; Dom Pedro
          surrounded de Avilez and ordered his troops to return to Portugal.&nbsp; Over
          the next few weeks, Pedro organized his forces and called up supporters
          from throughout Brazil.&nbsp; With cannons bearing down on the Portuguese
          fortifications, Pedro demanded the Legion&rsquo;s surrender and their
          return to Portugal.&nbsp; Although the Legion was a far better force
          than Pedro&rsquo;s army, de Avilez feared attacking his crown prince.&nbsp; Eventually,
          de Avilez capitulated after Pedro declared that the Legion would be
          slaughtered if they refused to accept his terms.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Following the Legion&rsquo;s surrender, Pedro focused on creating
          a stable government.&nbsp; He was aided by the brilliant professor
          and poet, Dr. Jos&eacute; Bonaf&aacute;cio de Andrada e Silva, who
          headed the new government.&nbsp; Bonaf&aacute;cio, as a Grand Master,
          rallied support from fellow Freemasons for complete independence from
          Portugal.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Pedro traveled throughout Brazil as &ldquo;Perpetual
          Defender,&rdquo; gathering support from the people, who cheered him
          everywhere he visited.&nbsp; While on his tour, Pedro was met by a
          messenger who informed the crown prince that the Portuguese government
          was opposed to an independent Brazil and that troops would be sent
          to restore order.&nbsp; A furious Pedro tore off the Portuguese insignia
          from his uniform and ordered his guards to do the same.&nbsp; He drew
          his sword and called for complete separation from Portugal in his Cry
          of Ipiranga, &ldquo;by the blood that flows in my veins and upon my
          honour, I swear to God to free Brazil!&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          Shortly after, Pedro was crowned emperor in Rio. In 1824, a national
          constitution was introduced, solidifying the government as a constitutional
          monarchy under Dom Pedro.&nbsp; That same year, their northern neighbor,
          the United States, became the first nation to recognize the Brazilian
          Empire.&nbsp; Portugal and Great Britain followed the United States
          in recognizing Brazil&rsquo;s sovereignty in 1825.<a
href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="">[22]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
          In less than twenty years, Brazil had been transformed from profitable
          Portuguese colony to a separate empire.&nbsp; While one empire in Lisbon
          crumbled, another was on the rise in Rio. </p>

Castell Coch (The Red Castle) was built on ancient 11th century Norman fortress ruins north of Cardiff in 1870. Intended as a country retreat in the hills for Third Marquis of
Bute (John Patrick Crichton-Stuart) and his family, Castell Coch was designed by the architect William Burgess. Constant reports of children’s laughter is said to echo through the
halls in the dead of night, but as we know something a lot more sinister can disguise itself as a child. Is this truly just the innocent echos of the earls children playing or something else trying to lure you in linked back to the pagan rituals of the normans ? When the Marquis died, Lady Gwendolyn lived on at the castle, but soon left due to the frequent apparition of an eerie lady dressed in white. It is assumed the lady haunted the area long before Castell Coch was built. The spirit is said to be a grieving mother who lost her son, unknown to her he fell down a well and drowned.
Never finding the closure to move on the woman died of a broken heart, she still roams the grounds, looking for the little boy or news of his fate. Another phantom that manifests itself at Castell Coch is the image of a man dressed in cavalier’s clothing, there is a legend of buried treasure on the site, perhaps he comes back to search for his lost plunder.

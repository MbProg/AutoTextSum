“Glorious”
5 of 5 stars Reviewed July 10, 2015
Sitting high above 'Tongwynlais' on a cliff, is the beautiful Castell Coch (red castle) reconstructed as a holiday home for the '3rd Marquess of Bute' who inherited it in 1848 'William Burges' was the architect employed for the task.
Originally, ''Castell coch'' was built by the 'Normans' after 1081 which was abandoned shortly after, changing hands a few times until the re build starting in 1897.
The castle is now in the hands of 'Cadw', the Welsh heritage agency...It is a lovely place to visit, with regular tours throughout the day!
Stunning...

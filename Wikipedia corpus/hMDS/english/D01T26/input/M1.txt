“Fairy Tale Castle brought to life”
5 of 5 stars Reviewed October 2, 2015
I visited Castell Coch (Red Castle) with my family of 2 young children aged 4 and 6 along with my wife and my mother in a wheelchair.
As you would expect with a castle is not very accessible for a wheelchair but the staff were great and helped my mother into the café whilst we went to explore.
Entry is free for disabled guests along with free entry for a carer.
For my 2 young children this was a fairy tale brought to life and they absolutely loved it especially with the great forestry scenery around it.
Prices in the café were reasonable and reflected good value for money!!

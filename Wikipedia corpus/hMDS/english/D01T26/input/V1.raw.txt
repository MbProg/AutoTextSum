“Fairy Tale Castle brought to life”
Reviewed October 2, 2015
I visited Castell Coch (Red Castle) with my family of 2 young children aged 4 and 6 along with my wife and my mother in a wheelchair.
As you would expect with a castle is not very accessible for a wheelchair but the staff were great and helped my mother into the café whilst we went to explore. Entry is free for disabled guests along with free entry for a carer.
For my 2 young children this was a fairy tale brought to life and they absolutely loved it especially with the great forestry scenery around it.
Prices in the café were reasonable and reflected good value for money!!

“Interesting visit a short drive from Cardiff”
Reviewed September 30, 2015
Did this and Caerphilly Castle in an afternoon comfortably. Casttell Coch is more interesting and well preserved inside. There is a small town at Caerphilly were you could wonder around and have lunch.

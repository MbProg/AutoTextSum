​Cardiff, the Welsh capital and its largest city, is steeped in over 2000 years of history, and is home to some of the UK’s most magical castles. Thousands of visitors will descend on the city this year as their iconic national stadium hosts a selection of games for the Rugby World Cup. If you’re not interested in watching any of the matches, there’s still plenty of other reasons to visit this beautiful city. Here are some of our favourite things to do and see.
 
​CARDIFF BAY
​Cardiff Bay, Europe’s Largest Waterfront Development, is home to a number of attractions such as Techniquest Science Discovery Centre, Craft in the Bay, The Welsh Assembly at the Pierhead, and the Wales Millennium Centre. Boat tours also operate daily, allowing you to soak in the atmosphere and view the beautiful scenery between Cardiff Bay and the City Centre.
 
​DOCTOR WHO CARDIFF BUS TOUR 
Not just for Doctor Who fans, this is a great way to see the Welsh capital and its surrounding areas including the Bay, the City Centre and Llandaff, where some of the most memorable scenes of Doctor Who were shot. The tour also includes a look inside parts of Cardiff Castle that are not accessible to the general public.
 
​MILLENNIUM STADIUM
​The Millennium Stadium plays host to some crucial rugby games this year for the Rugby World Cup, including Ireland’s first game against Canada. If you’re not lucky enough to get tickets to any matches there’s still plenty of opportunity to see the Welsh National Stadium, with tours taking place throughout the week.
 
​SPILLERS RECORDS
​Spillers, founded in 1894, is the oldest record store in the world. Originally located in the Queen’s Arcade, the shop has moved three times and is now found in Cardiff’s Morgan Arcade. They’ve a diverse selection of music on both CD and traditional vinyl, and are also the top vendor for tickets to alternative music gigs. On your visit make sure to pick up one of their iconic Spillers Record t-shirts. 
 
​THE TAFF TRAIL
​The Taff Trail is a popular path along the River Taff that runs for 55 miles from Roald Dahl Plass in Cardiff Bay to Brecon. The trail takes advantage of the former Taff Vale Railway routes, towpaths, tramways and beautiful Glamorganshire Canal, allowing you to walk or cycle through 2000 acres of stunning parkland. 
 
CARDIFF CASTLE
​In the heart of the Welsh capital is the beautiful Cardiff Castle, a truly remarkable and historical site. There’s plenty on offer here, including tours of their Wartime Shelters, Film Locations and the Cardiff Castle Ghost Tour. For an alternative night out, you can also book a traditional Welsh Banquet and experience an evening of Welsh food, wine and music.
 
​LLANERCH VINEYARD
Wales is fast developing a reputation for excellent wine production and is home to over 20 vineyards, scattered across its unique landscape. Llanerch Vineyard is a luxury vineyard hotel, located just 20 minutes outside Cardiff in the tranquil Glamorganshire countryside. They offer a wide range of activities including cooking demonstrations, afternoon tea and their annual grape harvest which takes place at the end of October.

The site gives visitors an incredible insight into the rich heritage and culture of Wales, with workshops, galleries, exhibitions and traditional festivals celebrated throughout the year.

Chicago Board of Trade Building
The Chicago Board of Trade building was the tallest building in the city for a 25-year span (1930 to 1965), but its iconic status among Chicago skyscrapers continues today.
It was the city's first commercial building to have electrical lighting, and it was the first to exceed 600 feet.
It's been featured in several movies.
The building was designated a Chicago landmark on May 4, 1977, and was made a national landmark on June 2 the following year.

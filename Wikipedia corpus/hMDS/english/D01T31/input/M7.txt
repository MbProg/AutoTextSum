The Chicago LaSalle Street picture is a view from 1911 and is looking north on LaSalle Street from the Chicago Board of Trade building, showing the old Illinois Trust & Savings Bank at the southeast corner of West Jackson Boulevard and South LaSalle Street in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois.
A flagpole is visible in the foreground as well as 1911 era vehicles.

CME Group said Monday it is marketing the historic Chicago Board of Trade Building in a deal that would involve the north and south buildings being offered as a partial sale-leaseback.
The company said it hired Jones Lang LaSalle and Holly Duran Real Estate Partners LLC to market the building.
CME also said it will enter into a long-term lease of the agricultural commodities trading floor, located in the north building, and office space in the south building.
It will retain ownership of the east building, which houses CME's financial trading floor.
CME Group acquired the three-building complex at 141 W. Jackson Boulevard in 2007, when it merged with the Chicago Board of Trade.
The Art Deco skyscraper, which was built in 1929, underwent a $22.6 million renovation in 2006.
The renovations were aided by a Class L Cook County tax credit worth about $9.8 million over 12 years.
After the 2007 merger with CBOT, CME moved its trading floors from 20 S. Wacker to the east building.
To make the move, the owners spent about $18.1 million in renovations, including adding more trading pits and booths.
CME received $15 million in Tax Increment Financing funds from the city for the renovations at the CBOT Building, CME's headquarters at 20 S. Wacker Drive and its offices at 550 W. Washington.
"CME Group remains committed to our floor based membership and open outcry trading services, which continue to be a profitable part of our business and serve our customers well," said CME Group Chief Financial Officer Jamie Parisi.

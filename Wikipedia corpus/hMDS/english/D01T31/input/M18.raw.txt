CME sells 2 CBOT buildings for $151M
April 23, 2012|By Alejandra Cancino | Tribune reporter
Chicago-based CME Group Inc. said Monday it sold for about $151.5 million two of three buildings that make the Chicago Board of Trade Building Complex.
The new owners are joint venture between GlenStar Properties LLC and USAA Real Estate Co. They will own the north and south towers of the building at 141 W. Jackson Blvd. As part of the deal, CME will lease back for 15 years the 150,000 square-feet it occupies in both, including the Agricultural Trading Floor.CME will continue to own the 288,000-square-foot east building, which houses CME's financial trading floor,and will change the address to 333 S. LaSalle St. 
CME, an operator of futures exchanges, acquired the three-building complex in 2007, when it merged with the Chicago Board of Trade. The Art Deco skyscraper, built in 1929, underwent a $22.6 million renovation in 2006, aided by a Class L Cook County tax credit worth about $9.8 million over 12 years.
After the 2007 merger with CBOT, CME moved its trading floors from 20 S. Wacker Drive to the east building. To make the move, the owners spent about $18.1 million on renovations, including adding more trading pits and booths. The city pledged $15 million in Tax Increment Financing funds for the renovations at the CBOT Building, CME's headquarters at 20 S. Wacker and its offices at 550 W. Washington St.
In February, CME Group said that it was not accepting the $15 million in TIF funds. In a letter to Emanuel announcing his decision, CME Executive Chairman Terrence Duffy said the revision of the state tax code for financial exchanges "are much more important" than the city's aid.

The Chicago Board of Trade Building(CBOT) has always been my favorite building in downtown Chicago.
The love of this building began well over 50 years ago.
My Mother worked in this building and I would visit her with my Grandmother.
We might go for lunch in the building or maybe even Berghoff's nearby.
I also had the adventure of going up to the observatory (long closed) on top of the building.
From the observatory one could look up and see Ceres, the godess of grain in all her steely glory.
This building, sitting at the head of LaSalle Street, with the Federal Reserve Bank and Continental Bank Building flanking it's base is the quintessential Chicago scene.
I think the CBOT Building is the best and most iconic building in Chicago.
The Railroads, Stock Yards, Airports, and Commodities Trading really were the fuel that built this city.
We've lost preeminence in all but one of those things.
The CBOT represents that Chicago is still one of the great Cities of the world.
This building personifies that position.
I hope this building long outlasts me as it's demise would truly hurt myself and this city.

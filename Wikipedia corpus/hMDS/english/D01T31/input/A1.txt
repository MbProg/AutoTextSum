Brick and Mortar: Tallest Buildings in Chicago, 1950
I am a fan of pre-war buildings, their ornamentation, and their seeming sense of solidity next to the glass boxes of more recent decades.
I also find old inner cities before suburbanization fascinating, and the year 1950 combines both of these topics.
This thread examines Chicago's skyscrapers in 1950.
That year, Chicago was comfortably the second largest city in the country, and with twice the population of Detroit, easily the "'Queen City of the Lakes."
A line of towers filed along the street with the first skyscraper, LaSalle Street, and a shorter but equally preserved wall of pre-war buildings sat along South Michigan Avenue, fronting broad Grant Park.
In the year 1950, the Chicago Metro area was one of the world's industrial powerhouses, with the raw materials and crops of the Midwest being refined in the metropolis and sent down the Great Lakes.
(The St. Lawrence Seaway, however, would not open for another nine years.)
In 1950, the largest city of the North American Interior was still Carl Sandberg's "Hog Butcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation."
The population of Chicago numbered 3,620,962; that mark is the highest in the city's history as the suburbs were about to explode across the surrounding counties.
Cook County was at 4,508,792 inhabitants while Lake County, Indiana had 368,152.
In Illinois, Lake was the most populous suburban county at 179,097.
The mayor that year was Martin Kennelly, while the Cook County Clerk was a 48-year-old politician named Richard J. Daley.
County Clerk Daley's son, Richard M., turned just eight in August.
This series continues for many other cities, including a link to New York, at my main page for this series.
The following pictures are from the spectacular Charles W. Cushman collection at the University of Indiana.

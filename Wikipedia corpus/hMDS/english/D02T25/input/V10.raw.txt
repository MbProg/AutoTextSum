Chalukya Dynasty
During the 6th and the 8th century, the empire that         ruled the Deccan region of India was the Chalukya dynasty. After fading         away for some time, they came back to power during the 10th century and         ruled till 12th century. The Chalukyas are essentially divided into         three broad categories:
Eastern Chalukyas: Ruled from the Vengi region
Western Chalukyas: Ruled from the Badami region
Later Western Chalukyas: Ruled from Kalyani region
The most famous rulers in the empire of the Chalukyas         were Pulakesin I and Pulakesin II. The ruler Pulakesin II is said to         have defeated emperor Harshavardhana in a battle on the banks of the         River Narmada. He also waged a battle against Mahendravarman, the         Pallava ruler and conquered him and his kingdom.
The Chalukya dynasty is famous for developing and encouraging art and         architecture during its era. The rulers of the Chalukya dynasty were         great enthusiasts of art. This is evident from the fact that they built         many temples near the region of Badami. A famous example of their         architecture is the Virupaksha Temple in Karnataka. The sculptures that         adorn the temples are beautifully carved and sculpted and represent         scenes from the famous epic Ramayana. Some of the paintings at Ajanta         and Ellora cave temples are considered to belong to this period.
Pulakesin II was an admirer of art and always encouraged any art form         to flourish in his kingdom. He was also fond of literature and         encouraged poetry to flourish in his kingdom. The three famous poets of         Kannada literature Adikavi Pampa, Sri Ponna and Ranna were from this         era. Pulakesin was an able administrator and his subjects were devoted         to him. Though he was Hindu by religion Pulakesin was tolerant towards         Buddhism as well as Jainism. He built many monasteries in his kingdom         that provided shelter to almost 5000 monks. The Chalukya kingdom was         truly flourishing till it declined after the 12th century.

Bramall Hall
Bramall Hall is a fine example of a Cheshire 'Black and White' timber-framed manor house.
Remodelling carried out in the late-19th century partially conceals the building's complex architectural history.
The oldest part of the house dates back to the late-14th century when John Davenport was lord of the manor.
The original building consisted of an open Hall with two cross wings.
Over the years there were many additions and adornments to the house, particularly in the 16th century when the Hall was floored over and the exterior walls were embellished with the intricate pattern of quatrefoils in squares.
In the late-18th century or early-19th century a second-floor long gallery was removed and the gatehouse range to the west demolished.
The house remained in the hands of the Davenport family until 1877 and in 1883 the local silk manufacturer, T.H. Neville, purchased the house for his son.
The house was extensively remodelled, restoring some of the picturesque charm lost by the alterations.
However, in the process much of the original texture was lost.
In the mid-20th century Bramall Hall was acquired by the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport.The house is approached from the west and from here the layout of the building can clearly be seen.
The service wing is to the left, the mainly Elizabethan hall range in the centre and the late-medieval chamber or solar wing to the right.
The gables adorning the hall range date from the late-19th century and are an imitation of nearby Little Moreton Hall.
Most of the brick chimneys and much of the woodwork were also replaced at this time.

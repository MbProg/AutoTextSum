Bramall Hall - a unique and intimate venue perfect for a very special wedding day.
Bramall Hall is a superb example of a Tudor Manor House with a thousand years of history, it is one of the most beautiful treasures of England and is of great national importance.
The Hall stands in 70 acres of parkland designed in the style of Capability Brown to give grand vistas over the terraces, lawns and lakes to the trees beyond.
This stunning landscape provides a wonderful backdrop for your wedding photographs.

An historic hall in Greater Manchester has closed for 18 months to undergo a £1.6m makeover.
Bramall Hall in Stockport, which dates back to medieval times, will reopen in spring 2016 when the work is complete.
As well as essential repairs, the revamp will also include an education room for schools and two new themed rooms, a Victorian Breakfast Room and a housekeepers' room and butler's pantry.
The Grade I listed Tudor manor house is set in 70 acres of parkland.

The colours are changing all around Stockport, no more so than at Bramhall Park.
This magnificent 70-acre park of woodland and trails is the ideal location for an afternoon stroll or a coffee and cake in the cafe.
It also houses Bramall Hall, the 14th century timber-framed building currently undergoing a £1.6m restoration .
The hall maybe shut until 2016, but the park remains open all year round.
Another sight to behold at this time of year is the Lyme Park rut set in the grounds of the National Trust property in Disley.

Image title: Stockport Bramall Hall and snow covered gardens
Bramall Hall Stockport is a medieval half-timbered house set in its own park.
The hillside is covered in snow and there is a blue sky.
The property is maintained by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council.
I often went to Bramall Hall as a child.
It is a magnificent sight, especially in snowy weather.
This photo featured on one of our hand-made Christmas cards.
As a child I was intrigued by stories of ghosts said to haunt Bramall Hall.

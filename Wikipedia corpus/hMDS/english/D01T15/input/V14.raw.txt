Picturing a Tudor Gentleman: Lyrics, Birds and Music at Bramall Hall (2013)

Abstract: 
Bramall Hall lies two miles south west of Stockport and, in the words of Nikolaus Pevsner, ‘is one of the four best timber-framed mansions of England’. Despite Stockport Council’s admission that Bramall is ‘the most prestigious and historically significant building in the Conservation Area’, it still remains something of a mystery. Although there are many interesting features in this hall, the focus of this paper can only be on the great chamber on the upper floor of the south wing. It dates to the sixteenth century and features high quality wall paintings, with animals, foliage and a Tudor musical scene. This paper examines these paintings, showing how they provide a valuable window into the moral interests, social anxiety and view of music held by lesser gentry in Tudor England.

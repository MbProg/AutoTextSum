Bramall Hall
This magical Tudor manor house is set in more than 50 acres of parkland with lakes, woods and gardens. The house contains 16th cent. wall paintings, fine Elizabethan plaster ceilings, Victorian kitchens and servants' quarters.
Bramall Hall is currently closed for restoration and refurbishment following a grant of £1×6 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
When the Hall re-opens in 2016 there will be more historic rooms open to the public, a new visitors’ centre and shop, an improved café and additional facilities for educational groups.
The Park will remain open, free of charge, during the work.

Great day out for families
Situated just outside the village, we found the Hall easy to find and get to.
The hall is situated in amazingly picturesque grounds, with lots of places to explore.
The kids loved it especially.
Next time, we will take a picnic with us as there are tables and seating around the grounds which would make this a great location if the weather holds out.
We didn’t have time to go into the Hall itself, but it’s definitely on our list for the next time we visit!
Well worth going and is clear why it’s become the landmark of Bramhall.

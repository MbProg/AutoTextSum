Davenports and dogs tails.....and other tales
It has often been said that "there are more Davenports than dogs tails".  Meaning that the Davenport name is so common it is difficult to count the number - they are everywhere, especially in the UK.  Such was the growth and spread of the Davenport family. Primarily represented in the UK and North America, the family is now spread widely around the globe to many countries, including South Africa and Australia.

The Davenports appear to have been prolific breeders! As just one example - John Davenport (born 1480) had 3 wives - Matilda, Jane and Blanche, he lived to the age of 74.  In total he had 13 children.  His oldest son John Davenport (born 1505) also had three wives: Eleanor, Jane and Anne.  By his first wife he had 8 children, by his second wife 7 and by his third wife 15.....30 children in all!  This John Davenports son was also John (born 1549), he married Elizabeth and he had 14 children.  So just these 3 John Davenports fathered 57 children between them.  No wonder the population of Davenports exploded!

Lancelot Davenport was the first of the family to arrive in the United States in 1620, soon followed by other well-known family members, including Rev John Davenport (1597-1669) who founded New Haven and Thomas Davenport (1615-1685) who was the ancestor of 3 US Presidents: William H Taft, George HW Bush and George W Bush.  
 
(Photo above) Three Shires Bridge over the Rive Dane - the river gave its name both to the village located there and the family name Davenport.  The river is more often described as a tricking stream than a river. The name of the river (earlier Dauen or Daven) is probably from the Old Welsh meaning a "drop or tickle", implying a slow-moving river.

Davenport township is located south of Manchester in the UK - it is located just west of Congleton in the Parish of Astbury, Cheshire.  Orme Davenport lived here at Davenport Hall around 1066.

The township of Davenport on the River Dane
 is widely recognised that all Davenports in the world are descended from Orme de Davenport (the name Davenport did not exist before him).

The Davenports were a family of significant landowners in the north-west of England whose antecedents can be traced back to the time of the Norman conquest.
 
Orme de Davenport was born around 1086 at Congleton, close to what is now Marton, and his name derives from the Norman French Dauen-port meaning "the town on the trickling stream"- referring to his home on the River Dane. In 1160, the family became responsible for keeping the Macclesfield Forest, and in the early 13th century Vivian Davenport became its Grand Sergeant. The family's coat of arms includes a man's head with a rope around the neck, which is said to represent the family's power over life and death during this period - the Davenports were in effect policemen, judge, jury and executioners. Signs depicting a man with a rope around his neck were also displayed at the entrances to the forests to warn trespassers, poachers and robbers of their fate should they be caught. The symbol became part of the Davenport family heritage.

The Davenports acquired land throughout the area, notably at Wheltrough, Henbury, Woodford and lastly at Bramall through marriage.

The Davenports held the manor for over 500 years, and it is likely that after their accession they built the current house. John de Davenport was the first Davenport owner of the current property in 1370.  He was succeeded by Robert de Davenport in 1400 then John de Davenport 2 in 1436. The first William Davenport was lord of the manor from 1478 to 1528, and one of the first recorded trustees of Macclesfield Grammar School. It is possible that he was heavily involved in the final battle of the Wars of the Roses at Bosworth and thereby instrumental in gaining the crown for Henry VII, who rewarded him with a pension of 20 marks per year payable for his lifetime. According to Dean, it was during this first William's tenure that Bramall may have been vandalised by a man named Randle Hassall, who destroyed all or part of nine houses and stole the timber. This gives credence to the theory that Bramall was rebuilt, replacing or partially replacing an older building.

William Davenport 2 was Lord from 1528 until 1541.

The third William Davenport, who succeeded his father of the same name in 1541, took part in what later became known as The Rough Wooing, a series of attacks against Scotland ordered by Henry VIII. He was knighted for his efforts in this campaign.

William Davenport 4 was owner from 1576 until 1585.

The fifth William Davenport inherited Bramall in 1585 from his father of the same name, and lived there with his wife Dorothy for over 50 years. The first marriage in Bramall's chapel was recorded in 1599, between William (aged 15) - the eldest son of the fifth William and Dorothy - and Frances Wilbraham (aged 11). On 22 April 1603 the fifth William Davenport was knighted by James I at Newark (where the king was staying on his journey from Edinburgh to London) and later became the High Sheriff of Cheshire and a Commissioner of the Hundred of Macclesfield. During the tenure of the fifth William, many alterations were made to the building, including the addition of a room above the Great Hall (which would later become the Withdrawing Room), and a long gallery. The internal decorations were also updated with additions such as wall paintings and portraits.

The sixth William succeeded his father in 1639 shortly before the English Civil War broke out. He was a 
Royalist, though said not to have been a particularly dedicated one. Many of his tenants became
Parliamentarian soldiers, and over the next three years he had numerous visits from Parliamentarian soldiers, mostly seeking to acquire goods such as horses and weapons for the war, and using the house for quartering soldiers. Bramall was also host to Royalist soldiers, who confiscated some of the Davenport
property for use in the war. William Davenport was at one point charged with delinquency, and
ordered to pay a fine of £750 (equivalent to £100,000 as of 2013), and soldiers continued to use Bramall because of its convenience.

The sixth William was briefly succeeded by his son Peter in 1655, who was followed by his son William 7 in 1658. William the seventh's son was the eighth William Davenport who acquired the estate in 1696, and an inventory of his property made shortly after his death in 1706 shows the gallery and gatehouse of Bramall were still intact.

John Davenport 3 inherited the property in 1706 and was followed by William 9 in 1722. It then passed to Warren Davenport in 1729.

The tenth William Davenport succeeded his father, Warren at the age of four in 1729. Many changes were made to the house during his 20 year tenure, including the dismantling of the gatehouse side of the courtyard and the long gallery, the latter of which may have been done because of their being considered unsafe. William and his wife had no children, so the estate passed to his oldest illegitimate daughter Maria (who William had adopted) on his death in 1829. 

Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, a Naval captain (later Rear Admiral), had married Maria in 1810, and lived in the area long before he succeeded his father-in-law. He became widely respected in the Stockport area, but following his succession to the estate in 1829, there were disputes from other members of the Davenport family who claimed a right to the property. Edmund Davenport, who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport, the third son of Peter, unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts; Edmund was eventually imprisoned and died a pauper for failing to pay Sir Salusburys legal fees. Ironically, Sir Salusburys solicitor in the case against Edmund (John Kenyon Winterbottom) was later convicted of forgery, jailed and ultimately transported to the Penal Settlement at Port Arthur in Tasmania, never to return to England.

Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services, and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport, in an effort to continue the Davenport line. He and Maria moved from Bramall to Cheltenham in 1841, most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns. Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in Leckhampton. Maria continued to own the property at Bramall in her name from 1845 until 1854 . 

Over the next decade the house was likely to have been let, as Maria Davenport was infirm and preferred to live elsewhere. Her eldest son, William Davenport Davenport inherited the property in 1854 and was married firstly to Camilla Maria Gatt, then secondly to Diana Handley, whom he lived with at Bramall for four years before the estate was passed to him. Maria moved to London where she lived with her youngest son, Charles, and died in 1866.

During William's tenure Bramall was regularly visited by members of the public, and the Chapel continued to be used for regular services of worship. However, following William's death in 1869, the property passed to John William Handley Davenport who was only 17 at the time, his fathers Will stating that title could not pass to him until his 25th birthday. The estate was therefore rented out for several years to Wakefield Christy of Christys & Co Hatting.

John WH Davenport returned to Bramall briefly in late 1876 at the age of 25, but on 24 January 1877 it was announced that the estate was to be sold. The furniture was auctioned off, and the house itself and rest of the Bramall estate (totalling 1,918 acres) was sold to the Freeholders Company Limited, a Manchester property development firm, on 3 August 1877 for £200,000 (about £14 million as of 2013).  According to speculation, the sale was motivated by financial issues and a personal distaste of the building (his wife in particular did not like it). John and his wife moved to Clipsham Hall in Rutland which had been inherited through her family.  Clipsham remained in the Davenport family until its sale in 2014.

Much of the Bramall estate land was sold off by the Freeholders Company but Bramhall Hall itself could neither attract a buyer nor tenant. It remained empty until 1882 when it was purchased by Thomas Nevill, a local industrialist whose wealth came from calico printing, for his son, Charles. While living in the house, Charles Nevill carried out substantial restoration and remodelling, making the interior more comfortable while retaining most of the building's external features. The landscape of the grounds was redesigned, and a new stable was built along with a west and east lodge, housing the coachman and head gardener respectively. Another building, known as Hall Cottage, was also built in the vicinity, and housed the Sidebottom family.  Charles died in 1916 and Thomas Nevill, Charles' nephew and adopted son, inherited the estate, but decided to sell it in 1922 following financial difficulties after the First World War. In 1923, many items of furniture were auctioned off, but there was no interest in purchase of the house. During that decade rumours arose that Bramall would be dismantled and transported to the United States; this may have been popularised by the autobiography of Kate Douglas Wiggin which described the author's visit to Bramall in 1890. In 1925, the house was auctioned, with the condition that if no purchaser came forward it would be demolished and the materials sold off. The local community were keen to keep the property and at one point the neighbouring local authority, Stockport County Borough Council, offered to buy the estate, but Nevill rejected their offer as "unacceptable". The auction received no acceptable offers. However, one of those present, John Henry Davies, president of Manchester United, was keen to "save" the historic property and later offered £15,000 for the house and this was accepted. He lived in the house until his death in 1927, and his widow Amy remained there until 1935,when she sold it to Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council for £14,360  with the clear intention that the house and park be properly maintained and be open to the public.

Under Council ownership, the house was occupied by a caretaker, though most of the building was open to the public. The house and grounds were used for various functions, such as the proclamation of George VI succeeding his brother King Edward VIII to the throne. At that time, the house was sparsely furnished as the Council was unable to afford much furniture. One of the Council's earliest projects was the restoration of the Chapel, which had fallen out of use towards the end of the 19th century. It was restored to resemble how it would have been when the Davenports were last at Bramall, and a service of consecration was held on 30 October 1938 once the work had been completed. In 1947, an association called the Friends of Bramall Hall was set up, primarily to find furnishings for the house, but also to advise and assist in the upkeep of the house and grounds. Over the years, many furnishings which had once belonged to
the house were returned, including portraits of the occupants. The estate is now the property of 
Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council (SMBC), which acquired it in 1974 following local government reorganisation.

The house and grounds are now open to the public and are run by SMBC. Visitors may take an official tour of the house or wander the grounds freely. Events and club meetings are held in the house and grounds throughout the year, and local schools often visit to experience life in a particular era. The house is licensed for wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, and has been used as a background for television series and films, including Prank Patrol, Cash in the Attic, Coronation Street and The Last Vampyre.

Although the house and the park are known by the name "Bramall", both have been spelled as "Bramhall", "Bramal" and other variations over the years. The Domesday Book used the spelling "Bramale", which led Charles Nevill to prefer "Bramall", a convention maintained by Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council when it acquired the property, and continued by Stockport Council. There remains, however, confusion over spelling, most often with the house being referred to as "Bramhall", the name of the village in which Bramall Hall is situated.

There has been a settlement at Bramall since Saxon times. According to Alfred Burton, who wrote about Bramall in the late 19th century, the house has not always been in the present location, and was originally at Crow Holt Wood. This theory was rejected by another historian, Frederick Moorhouse, who became convinced in 1909 that Crow Holt Wood was a place where animals would have been taken to be sorted. There is no conclusive evidence to support either theory. Today the house is situated at the top of two valleys to its south and east sides, which two streams run through. It is a grade I listed building,
and the oldest parts date from the late 14th century, with later renovations dating from the 16th and 19th centuries. It was originally accessed from the east side – the drive followed the route of the Ladybrook stream, then uphill towards the Chapel on the south side, reaching the courtyard on the other side. The main entrance is now on the side of the courtyard, in the west, because of the restructuring of the drive in 1888. The current layout of the house can clearly be seen from the west side of the building, in the courtyard: the service wing is on the left, the Great Hall is in the centre, and the Banqueting Hall is on the right. Before the 19th century, the courtyard was enclosed by a gatehouse which was taken down
between 1774 and 1819, because of its being neither required nor in vogue.

The house is built with stone foundations, and the main structure is made of oak timbers, joined
together using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the 
timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired
in later years.

The Great Hall is the central part of Bramall Hall. As with typical great halls in the Middle Ages, this would have been the room where the business of the house, estate and its villagers was conducted as well as a communal eating room for the household. It was originally an open-roofed, single-storey building, with a
fireplace situated in the middle of the floor. It was probably first built around the end of the 14th century when the Davenports became lords of the manor. Towards the end of the 16th century, the Great Hall was substantially rebuilt, and the Withdrawing Room was created above it. A long gallery was also added as a third storey. The history of the gallery is uncertain; it was intact in 1790 but was taken down before 1819, because it was believed to be unsafe. A similar gallery was built at Little Moreton Hall, and it is still intact, causing the lower storeys to buckle under the weight. The Great Hall has a bay window with leaded windows, common throughout the building. William Harrison Ainsworth wrote about a right of way through the Great Hall, in his 1834 novel Rookwood. He described how a traveller could pass through the Great Hall, and be entertained and sometimes refreshed. He described Bramall as "[the] best specimen of its type... its class, in our opinion, is the best ... to be met with in Cheshire". No evidence exists for any such right of way. According to another tale, food from the buttery hatch was given to the poor who congregated outside.

The Lesser Hall leads off the southern end of the Great Hall. Its walls are panelled with oak, and the timbers that the ceiling is constructed of are decorated with cross and rose shapes dating from the Victorian era. The Banqueting Hall, which leads off the Lesser Hall to the west, is believed by Dean to be the oldest part of the house. Its northern wall is possibly the oldest part of the house, not having been
renovated like the rest of the courtyard walls. The Nevills used this room as a billiards room. The Chapel, opposite the Banqueting Hall, was the only place of public worship in Bramhall for many years. Its existence was first recorded in 1541, when it was described in the will of the second William Davenport.It fell into disrepair after its closure between 1869 and 1890, and was restored by the council following their purchase of the property in 1935, and religious services began to be held there again. On the north wall are unglazed windows which face the wall of the Library, showing that the south wing was once separate from the Great Hall. The Ten Commandments are written on the west wall. Underneath the Commandments, an older, pre-Reformation Passion painting, is visible. Such depictions were banned during the Reformation, and whitewashed over. It was not until the 20th century that efforts were made to restore Passion paintings, but very little of this particular painting survives.

The Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean
likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme "Ride a cock horse", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.

 North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name "paradise" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side. On the other side there is a small recess, which was described in a 1882 newspaper as "a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown". It is possible that this was a priest's hide, adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room. Less romantically, it may, alternatively, have been a garderobe or privy. This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century, and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose, though no such passages appear to exist.

The largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room, situated above the Great Hall. It has an elaborate plaster ceiling, and the overmantel above the fireplace bears the arms of Queen Elizabeth I. The
frieze of the Withdrawing Room incorporates shields of arms representing marriages of the Davenports.

The northern wing of Bramall came to be the service wing with the kitchen, scullery, butler's pantry, dairy and store rooms on the ground floor and the servants' bedrooms in the attic.

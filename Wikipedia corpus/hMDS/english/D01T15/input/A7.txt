Bramall Hall
Bramhall, Stockport.
Tel: 0161-485 3708.
Described by Pevsner as "...one of            the four best timber mansions in England".
Visitors are            often confused to find Bramall Hall is in Bramhall !
Locally            the disparity was controversial too.
This came about when, in 1935,            Hazel Grove & Bramhall Urban District Council acquired the Hall, and            in keeping with the original entry in the Domesday book, decided to            retain the original spelling of "Bramall" for the house.

History
Bramall Hall currently is owned by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, and is one of best preserved black            and white timber buildings, typical in Cheshire.
Its oldest parts date            from the 14th century, though the estate itself dates back to around            1070 AD when William the Conqueror subdued the North West region; dividing            the land amongst his loyal followers, the manor of "Bramale" were given            to Hamo de Masci ("Massey" - he became the first baron of Dunham Massey).
In earlier Saxon times, (before the Conquest), the estate formed part            of the much bigger two neighbouring manors of Brun and Hacun.
In the            12th century the manor passed to the Bromale family, and stayed with            them for 200 years until, through marriage, it passed to Davenports,            who resided at Bramall for 500 years.
The building shows a great deal            of subsequent rebuilding and addition - much of it following current            fashion of the day, though most was accomplished after it passed from            the Davenport family in 1877.
It stood empty until purchase by Charles            Neville, a local calico printer, in 1883.
Neville made many sympathetic            alterations, with the assistance of architect, George Faulkener Armitage            - notably, the interior was made more comfortable while retaining most            of the buildings external features.
In 1923, after the Great War, the            family's changing fortunes compelled Thomas Neville to sell the house            and contents to John Henry Davies, who lived there until his death in            1927, though his widow, Amy lived on the estate until 1935 when she            sold it to Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council.
Following            Local Government reorganisation in 1974, the estate became the responsibility            of the new Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, who still maintain            it.
The Park
Over 62 acres of beautifully landscaped parkland (dating from the 19th            century) with lakes and waterfowl.
A ha-ha, or sunken ditch separates            the Hall from the park to keep cattle out.
The park is a Mecca for local            residents, and makes a pleasant picnic or walking site.

Bramall Hall
Bramhall, Stockport.
Tel: 0161-485 3708.
Described by Pevsner as "...one of the four best timber mansions in England".
Visitors are often confused to find Bramall Hall is in Bramhall !
Locally the disparity was controversial too.
This came about when, in 1935, Hazel Grove & Bramhall Urban District Council acquired the Hall, and in keeping with the original entry in the Domesday book, decided to retain the original spelling of "Bramall" for the house.

History
Bramall Hall currently is owned by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, and is one of best preserved black and white timber buildings, typical in Cheshire.
Its oldest parts date from the 14th century, though the estate itself dates back to around 1070 AD when William the Conqueror subdued the North West region; dividing the land amongst his loyal followers, the manor of "Bramale" were given to Hamo de Masci ("Massey" - he became the first baron of Dunham Massey).
In earlier Saxon times, (before the Conquest), the estate formed part of the much bigger two neighbouring manors of Brun and Hacun.
In the 12th century the manor passed to the Bromale family, and stayed with them for 200 years until, through marriage, it passed to Davenports, who resided at Bramall for 500 years.
The building shows a great deal of subsequent rebuilding and addition - much of it following current fashion of the day, though most was accomplished after it passed from the Davenport family in 1877.
It stood empty until purchase by Charles Neville, a local calico printer, in 1883.
Neville made many sympathetic alterations, with the assistance of architect, George Faulkener Armitage - notably, the interior was made more comfortable while retaining most of the buildings external features.
In 1923, after the Great War, the family's changing fortunes compelled Thomas Neville to sell the house and contents to John Henry Davies, who lived there until his death in 1927, though his widow, Amy lived on the estate until 1935 when she sold it to Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council.
Following Local Government reorganisation in 1974, the estate became the responsibility of the new Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, who still maintain it.

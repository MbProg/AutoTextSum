The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the name of the Manhattan Project's production installation during World War II that produced the enriched uranium used in the bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945, as well as the first examples of reactor produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in the eastern part of the state of Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, Tennessee, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County although the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943.
Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army in 1943, the temporary Happy Valley community housed 15,000 people in trailer homes. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000. The town was developed by the federal government as a segregated community; black residents lived only in an area known as Gamble Valley, in government-built "hutments" (one-room shacks) on the south side of what is now Tuskegee Drive.

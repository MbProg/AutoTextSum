Wind, Hydroelectric, Tidal, Wave, and (as you said) Photovoltaic
I think those most of the ones that aren't steam turbines, though 4 of those just spin turbines in a different manner.
I guess piezoelectric elements are also different, but I don't think they are used for large scale things yet.
Figuring out that spinning magnets in coiled wires makes electricity seems to be a very underrated discovery.

Most molten salt reactors actually use the heat from the salt coolant to boil water.
Only reactors operating on a gas cycle are different—and even then it's just hot gas (CO₂ or He) versus hot stream.
Almost everything is about heating a gas be it steam or a room temperature gas and spinning a turbine.

The investment into the current reactors was pretty much just an investment into producing the isotopes needed to construct nuclear weapons since humanity is always ready to spend infinite money on war.
Nobody cares about putting any real money on science on innovation, as long as they can take their gas powered car and buy a big mac.
The "space race" was just a war game as well.

That's simply not correct.
The US Navy needed a power source that could power their submarines.
Out of this came the light water reactor.
Since the navy developed it, it was well understood and ready to go when the civilians wanted their nuclear reactors.
Weapons wasn't a consideration.
If you want weapons materials, power reactors suck because they burn up the weapons materials that you want and replace it with a bunch of nasty junk.
US plutonium was made at the non-power reactors at the Hanford and Savannah River sites.
This is what the Syrians were trying to do a few years ago.

and had the funding to develop one because they were the Navy.
Spooc is essentially correct.
Both the Space race and Nuclear energy had more to do with defense and geo-politics than stated goals like science and furthering mankind's reach to the stars.
If it was about those things, we would have colonies on Mars and better than second generation reactors in play.

I'm just trying to make sure that it's understood that US power reactors aren't producing plutonium for the use in bombs, which is what /u/spooc said the light water reactor was built for.
Yes, the light water reactor was developed by the US Navy for military purposes, but civilian power reactors aren't encouraging the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
If anything they were discouraging it as for 20 years 1/2 of all US nuclear fuel came from Russian warheads.

Light water reactors are pretty bad at making Pu.
But CANDUs are descended from the incomplete designs Canada was working on for the Manhattan project (never used for Pu production) that's why they're natural uranium with online refueling.

Unfortunately just a professor.
Atomic Heritage says that CANDUs were based on the ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental Pile) which was an experimental reactor with the goal of producing plutonium.
The wiki article on ZEEP has relevant comments, haven't looked at the SIX references it has on that claim.
This book page 9-10 seems relevant, but claims the scientist developed the work while waiting for "war work".

Yes, the light water reactor has military applications, but his statement was that they were used for "producing the isotopes needed to construct nuclear weapons."
His statement makes it sound like the civilian power industry selected the light water reactor to help the US government build bombs.
What I'm saying is the light water reactor was selected by the civilians in not only the US but much of Europe as well because the US Navy figured out how to make it work.

I'm not wrong.
By the end of the war, following an idea of Alvin Weinberg, natural uranium fuel elements were arranged in a lattice in ordinary water at the top of the X10 reactor to evaluate the neutron multiplication factor.
[3] The purpose of this experience was to determine the feasibility of a nuclear reactor using light water as a moderator and coolant, and cladded solid uranium as fuel.
The results showed that, with a lightly enriched uranium, criticality could be reached.
[4] This experience was the first practical step toward light water reactor.
The X-10 reactor was part of the Manhattan project and constructed and funded with the intent to produce the isotopes needed to research and constrct a nuclear bomb.
This was before submarines was even thought of.
When President Roosevelt in December 1942 authorized the Manhattan Project, the Oak Ridge site in eastern Tennessee had already been obtained for the Clinton Engineer Works and plans had been laid for establishing an air-cooled experimental pile, a pilot chemical separation plant, and support facilities.
The X-10 Graphite Reactor, designed and built in ten months, went into operation on November 4, 1943.
The reactor used neutrons emitted in the fission of uranium-235 to convert uranium-238 into a new element, plutonium-239.
And it doesn't really matter because just as /u/pocketknifeMT pointed out, my main point was that nuclear energy research was funded by war efforts, not because a benevolent state wanted free energy for their citizens, and submarines are war machines.

The issue with your original statement was your claim that current reactors were invested in to develop weapons materials.
I don't think anyone with any sense would ever argue that nuclear science, and sciences in general, have a great deal of their research coming from militaries.
If you're going to conflate modern nuclear power as being militaristic, then so should the products and research that were also influenced by militaries like the airplane, the internet, GPS, cellphones, M&M's, SPAM, automobiles, skydiving, concrete, prosthetics, etc.

Just wanted to point out that this is a very well done eli5 for nuclear power.
As a (real) nuclear engineer, I feel like I should point out a couple of those designs the video mentioned that are planned to replace current designs:
AP-1000 a large PWR design that utilizes a lot of passive safety systems, while still being able to dole out huge amounts of energy
SMRs  or Small Modular Reactors, like the NuScale design, http://www.nuscalepower.com Are what I consider the next replacement and advancement of nuclear power plants
There are also many gas cooled and iterestingly shaped reactors that are undergoing current research, like this one: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_wave_reactor
I've never really participated on reddit before, but I'd be glad to answer any questions, or at least point anyone in the right direction.

Nuclear engineer here.
There are a lot of issues that need to be figured out before one of these will be used by utilities.
I would guess at least 20 years of constant, very productive (read lot's of funding) research.
It is radically different and there will need to be quite a few prototypes of different forms for this to happen.
We're going to need some liquid fueled reactors and the reprocessing component I bet will at least double the work required.
I am eagerly waiting for one to be built again, but it's going to be a bit.
The good news is progress is happening http://fortune.com/2015/02/02/doe-china-molten-salt-nuclear-reactor/

It's simply too early to tell, because last I saw there was no substantive information on how there experiments have been going.
Really the only thing that is giving them any credibility is their name.
IF Skunkworks or anyone else ever develops a fusion reactor with net power generation that is greater than 1, we could see a big shift and expansion of nuclear energy.
This is only if they're economically viable.

I absolutely think molten salt reactors are interesting and worth researching, but iirc, molten salt is very corrosive, and is inherently hard to handle from a material science perspective.
There are other types of fuels that are being looked at, and I believe there are advantages and disadvantages to all.
As far as that guys video, the one in the TL;DR, was pretty very hyped, he made it seem like if you have water as the coolant, you have to have non-passive safety systems.
In other words, without a pump the LWRs  we are working on now can't be safely cooled in an accident.
I know that this is not true, for example the NuScale reactor not only doesn't need any pumps to cool itself off, as it uses natural convection all the time for cooling the core, it also doesn't need any water, as it can be passively cooled by air alone.
Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of problems with the NuScale reactor, and its class of reactors, and it's process it is going through to get certified.
It is just my opinion that these are the next step in the evolution of these incredibly safe reactors.

Another nuclear engineering student here.
From a design perspective you'd be right, but that's not the problem SMRs are trying to solve.
It's all about the economics.
The problem with nuclear power in its current incarnation, at least from an economic standpoint, is that none of the big utilities want to invest in it and the cost of building a nuclear power plant is all up-front, discouraging investment from smaller players.
The major advantage of SMRs is lowering that massive barrier to entry for the market by making nuclear power scalable.
See, a small-ish energy investor that couldn't afford the billions of dollars of building an AP-1000 design might be able to afford the 100 millions of dollars that starting an SMR installation with one or two units would cost, and could then install more units after recouping costs.
There's also other advantages, like the ability to mass-produce small cores at a central facility and ship them to installations, but the big one is making a scalable nuclear utility rather than large single-size utilities like the AP-1000.

I actually am continuing my education in nuclear engineering with the goal of a master's degree.
I specifically do research in thermal hydraulics at the University I attend.
From a personal perspective, I think SMRs are worth their recent popularity because of their scalability.
Yes they were researched with the intent for us in smaller populated areas, but they, at least the NuScale design, is made to be scaled so it can have the ability to meet the needs of any sized area, all the way up to the output of an AP-1000.
They also have the ability to have the rest of the plant running while 1 module is being refueled.
Their safety systems are completely passive, meaning they do not require electricity, or human operation to be successful in cooling the decay heat that is present after a shutdown, whether that be from an accident like a loss of off site  power, or a LOCA.
Basically, they address the main issues with nuclear power plants straight away, while keeping the familiarity of LWRs that we have come to understand very well.

Don't get me wrong about AP-1000s either, they are the latest and greatest as far as what is being produced right now, which is awesome, and they should continue to be built.
I know they are building two, which will be the first AP-1000s in the USA, in Georgia so it would be a dream to work for them eventually.
I just think it makes more sense to address electricity generation in a modular sense, building what you need with having to spend the outrageous amount of money for a limo when you only need a compact.

solar is pretty damaging to birds since their reflective surface appears to be like water.
Quite a few flocks have crashed into solar fields.
Also recently a field had to be readjusted after frying a flock of birds out of the sky

The charts and the table you provide do not align.
Your chart says the order for the lowest three are : nuclear, wind, solar.
The graph you linked from ExternE says the bottom three (in same lowest to highest order) are: hydro, nuclear, vind (wind).
Why the discrepancy?

Your statistic sucks, because it doesn't tell us anything.
A few decades ago a Hydroelectric dam broke in China killing up to almost 200.000 People (30k+ on direct impact of the flood (meaning in less than 24 hours), the rest died of desease or starved to death).
If you add every nuclear accident, every coal fueled power plant or oil spill together, you wouldn't reache those numbers remotely.
Your statistic doesn't account for that with only 1.4 deaths/year/TWh.
From what year is that statistic?
Would it be from 1986 the Nuclear column would surpass every other category.
Was it from the year the dam broke Hydro would surpass everything else.
If it was from a year with a devastating coal mine incident, the number would also be higher.
Which year did these numbers come from?
Or is it the average of every year since deaths in the workplace were documented?
I have no clue of statistics, but if you toss out such a chart, please explain it enough for us non-statistic folk can understand it.
Also, statistics only tell us about the stuff that happened in the past, not about the shit that could happen.
Just because something didn't happen yet, doesn't mean that it will never happen.

Deaths per unit of power generated is probably the most useful statistic possible when trying to compare the safety of different sources of power.
If you add every nuclear accident, every coal fueled power plant or oil spill together, you wouldn't reache those numbers remotely.
Hydro dams can fail spectacularily.
Just that one dam collapse caused over 7x more deaths than chernobyl.
But even chernobyl, in the context of global energy production, is small fry compared to coal.
As a matter of fact, that chart includes that dam disaster (it was in india), but coal has easily killed more than that number (and don't get me started on deaths from lung cancer).
Hell, just in 2004, 6000 people died in coal mining accidents in china.
That's one country, one year, and only one part of the process of generating that energy.
Perhaps nuclear power is overhyped as being dangerous in the media.
You know, considering how actually safe it is.

I attempted to find some sources for you, with mediocre luck.
Here's where that chart originates from (with an updated version).
There's some sources in the comments and some points about why the numbers are what they are.
There's also separated out China vs. World to account for coal mining and hydro disasters you talked about.
Hopefully it gives some insight into why the numbers are what they are.
It doesn't seem terribly biased in analysis, although the author doesn't explain their analysis in detail either.

How about this for the storage problem, we currently have 100 active nuclear reactors in the United States.
Each and everyone of them is paying for security to guard their waste storage areas on site.
You will have to continue to pay them to guard those numerous different facilities even if we stop producing any more waste.
Centralized storage is the only reasonable option, it is just a problem with not in my backyard politics.

yeah!
2001 a space odyssey really predicted what life would be like in 2001.
You cannot predict it well enough to use it as a reason to justify something being safer.
It's that simple.
Perhaps, they will hit a wall with their ideas and have to start from scratch.
Perhaps there will be a disaster/leak before your 50,000 year timeline that kills many people.
I know I will get downvoted because there is a big circle jerk with this site where every little "breakthrough" is upvoted to the front page but because we make breakthroughs all the time is not a valid argument.At least site progress for thinking that way about this issue instead of just saying but future us will be able to science better.

I'm downvoting you solely because you said you were going to be downvoted.
Can't stand when people say that.
We are able to contain nuclear waste right now, only human error is causing issues.
Without human error, or with less and less of it with the advancement of technology, we can be closer and closer to perfectly safe.
A coal plant could blow up in a few months and cause massive power outages that lead to people dieing due to heat stroke, a wind turbine could get picked up by a tornado and kill people, a dam could break and kill people, a solar field could malfunction and go out as well.
If we only focus on the negatives all we are going to get is what if, what if, what if.
Perhaps, they will hit a wall with their ideas and have to start from scratch.
That's totally possible, but we are talking about 50000 years.
Perhaps there will be a disaster/leak before your 50,000 year timeline that kills many people.
That's totally possible, in that same mindset I can say that there's a massive disaster that causes dams to break and coal plants to explode.
At this point in time Nuclear power is one of the cleanest non renewable sources of power, not taking advantage of it is silly.

I am not commenting on the safety of nuclear power but that argument fails.
There is a quote from my first comment.
I agree that nuclear power is a great option.
But your argument against the waste makes no sense.
Yes, good things could happen in 50 thousand years, so could bad things.
If we only focus on the negatives all we are going to get is what if, what if, what if.
Funny i see you as saying well what if in 50,000 years we come up with a better way to handle nuclear waste as opposed to just taking the hit that yeah nuclear waste is really the only major downside to nuclear power right now.
That's totally possible, in that same mindset I can say that there's a massive disaster that causes dams to break and coal plants to explode.
Again I am not advocating just saying your in the future argument is shitty.
But hey maybe in the future it will improve.

This whole discussion is pointless.
With the current rate of change in human technological innovation, if we still have to worry about such simple things in 50,000 years we're doing it all wrong.
We will have either killed ourselves off or figured out how to colonize other worlds.
I really don't think you comprehend how long 50,000 years is either, that is 10 times the length of ALL recorded history.
Even ignoring how stupidly large of a timescale we are discussing here, there will be much more danger in geologically sudden cataclysmic events (cosmic impacts, sea level rise, etc.) than in long term, predictable waste exposure.
Worst case scenario, a small area loses drinking water because the water table was contaminated.
Nuclear waste is incredibly localized in that respect.
Even if a reactor melts down, the radioactive wastes that can perpetuate in the atmosphere have hilariously short half-lives.
All of the dangerous waste is dense and falls to the ground.
As in you could send out a crew in hazmat suits to clean it up with bulldozers and brooms (what they did in Fukushima).
I really don't know what you're trying to argue here.

This was the comment.
No mention of any evidence was presented.
In fact, if you scroll and look down I am the only one who mentions any kind of reason that supports the argument, mainly that we are learning to recycle spent fuel.
THAT IS  A REASONABLE ARGUMENT.
Saying hey there is a trend for technological advancement so some day we must invent a way to handle this right?
Wrong, that doesn't follow.
Our ability to advance in technology is not a given, it depends on many factors, factors which are not guaranteed to be the same tomorrow, meaning you cannot use it as a reason that a problem will be solved in order to dismiss an issue the one in the comment I replied to was dismissing nuclear waste.
That was the only point I was trying to make.
I don't know what else I need to explain.

No it isn't ;) Nuclear has the most long-term unsolved problems of all efficient power generation methods, and is the most inherently dangerous power generation method, requiring very large, very expensive, and very intricate safety measures.
The worst case scenario of nuclear isn't a localized incident, unlike all other power generation methods.
The way Uranium Mining is done is very controversial.

And we have a still unsolved waste problem, where even the medium lived fission products have a half-life that can be over 30 years.

Okay, everybody listen up.
Former nuclear engineer here; studied it for 2 years and then switched majors because it was too difficult.
Here's the truth:
-You receive more radiation from a passing train than you would living next to a nuclear power plant.
-The Chicago area receives 90% of it's power from nuclear generation.
-Fission reactions emit a blue wave of light, not green like in the Simpsons, but I don't know why.
-The Japanese were very stupid for building a reactor in a tsunami and earthquake zone, it's not nuclear energy's fault.
-Don't say a damn thing about Chernobyl or Three Mile Island; modern reactors have many more layers of security and basically won't ever meltdown (unless you put the plant in front of a tsunami).
EDIT: Lighten up everybody, I'm just joking around, OBVIOUSLY!
Thanks to the real physicists and nuke engrs who provided insightful feedback; take a look at what they have to say below because they know what they're talking about, OBVIOUSLY!!

Not to be a dick but calling yourself a nuclear engineer cause you did two years of school is like calling myself an actor cause I took a theatre class.
Just a couple corrections/additions: The blue glow is from Cherenkov radiation; electrons are moving faster than light under water.
While I agree that current plants are much safer than Chernobyl,  the fact is there is many currently operating plants with the same design as TMI or very close to it.
TMI resulted in no radiation releases  and no harm to the public and there's definitely been a lot more focus on safety since then, but to  say that current plants are inherently safer isn't true.
The power for normal cooling in a plant comes from  AC power; if this power is lost emergency diesel generators provide this power.
There's numerous diesel generators to ensure that if one or two fails that the plant can still be kept safe.
After Fukushima there's been a massive initiative in the industry to provide even more redundancy with more DGs as well as analyzing and preparing for more devastating accidents.
Of course if all these DGs fail, as happened in Fukushima when they got flooded, you're well fucked.
New reactor designs include passive safety features, namely that the core will be cooled by natural circulation so no DGs are needed.

I'm a nuclear electrician at Palo Verde.
If certain conditions are met our reactors all shut down automatically after 30 days.
Safety is a big issue but in my opinion, adding even more redundancy is just asinine.
Building fukushima was a mistake in the first place, they built it on a coast that's prone to tsunamis for starters, then to top it off, they decided that their reactor vessels should be dropped in from the top instead of lifted in from the bottom.
When the generators failed they had no way of lifting their reactor vessels out of their vaults.
Truly brilliant engineering.

If my understanding is correct, then that's about right.
I believe it's because of refraction causing the light to bend and go off path slightly.
So it had a tiny bit more length on it's overall journey.

No, the path doesn't get longer.
The electric field of the initial light starts jiggling the atoms and electrons of the medium.
Which in turn release their own photons/waves.
The light that comes out of the medium at the end is a superposition of the initial light and those myriad of additional "disturbances" it caused.
Here's one of two videos from Sixty Symbols that explains it.

No actual object/energy/information is moving faster than the speed of light.
Edit: specifically for Cherenkov radiation, the phase velocity of light is much slower than c, allowing charged particles to travel faster than the light.

(Everyone's already answered you but I want to feel smart so whatever)
That's only true in a vacuum.
If light were to travel through a substance that slows its speed to, say, 1 meter per second, particles traveling through that substance wouldn't be restricted to 1 meter per second.
They couldn't travel faster than light in a vacuum, however, they could travel faster than light once it's being slowed down.

The blue glow is from Cherenkov radiation; electrons are moving faster than light under water.
Before someone jumps up and down on you.
They mean moving faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium.
Light travels at 0.75c in water as compared to a vacuum, so the electrons are traveling faster than 0.75c.

I got a bachelors in NE and got a job out of college.
Being diverse and having a mechanical engineering background definitely doesn't hurt, but a lot of stuff you learn as an undergraduate nuke apply to Mechanical engineering, like thermal hydraulics, heat transfer etc.
I will say that if you're in the USA and are a foreign national (inferring because of your English), that it could be very difficult to get a job in the industry.

I am actual from the UK but i cant spell for shit but somehow i got an A in English anyway.
The uk government is financing EDF to build several new reactors and also increase the life-span of others furthermore i think some Chinese companies are looking at investing.
So it looks quite promising to get a job in the industry.
Thank for the reply.

This is only partially related, but last year, the Harvard Business Review published a great article about the other Fukushima plant that was hit by the tsunami.
I think it does a great job of illustrating the thought process that went into saving Fukushima Daini from meltdown.
Admittedly, the tsunami hit was not as direct, but the Daini plant also had better leadership and a more robust safety culture than Daiichi.

That is an interesting article, but I have not seen anything to indicate that the leadership at Daiichi was less than Daini, or that there was any way that the Daiichi plant even could have been saved under any circumstances.
(BTW, if you are aware of such information I would be interested in reading it.)

You're right--it doesn't explicitly say that Daini reacted differently.
However, a "lessons learned" letter from NEI in 2013 details how FLEX Concepts helped save Daini from meltdown while also mentioning that the conditions were not drastically different than Daiichi.

Japan might have done better to build new, safe ones and retire their plants when they planned to.
Fukushima was WAY overdue to be decommissioned, but they didn't have anything to replace it because of intense backlash to new, safe plants.

The blue light from fission reactors occurs from charged particles traveling faster than the speed of light in water.
In a fission event, electrons and alpha particles are created from radioactive decay in the fission cascade, some with sufficient kinetic energy to travel faster than the speed of light in the water surrounding the reactor (c / 1.33).
This creates a "shock-wave" (analagous to sonic boom) and light is emitted.
The light is blue because this effect creates light preferentially with shorter wavelengths.
The exact physics why this is the case are quite complicated.
Look up Cerenkov radiation if you find this interesting.

What do layers of security have to do with causing a melt down?
While yes, the Gen 3 reactors that are being developed now have better (passive) safety features, all of the operating reactors in the US were built 30 years ago.
They are still on par with what was built at TMI.
Administratively, more safety measures (PAMS, inspections) have been put in place due to incidents at TMI and Davis-Besse.

Preventative "safety" layers, is what I meant.
I don't know the first thing about what kind of safety features plants have, but shouldn't it be true that with our computing power today, we could design much safer plants?
Take airplanes for example; look how far flight systems have come since the 90's.
The number of accidents due to mechanical error has gone down significantly over the past 30 years and continues to decrease, partly due to technological improvement and partly due to lessons learned from accident investigations.
There's no reason we shouldn't be able to build disaster-proof reactors.

"Computing power" has nothing to do with how safe a plant is.
Safety is determined by the design of the physical plant itself.
Most of the passive safety features of the Gen 3 plants are mechanical in nature.
The I&C in the new Gen 3 plants are still using technology that's ~20 years old due to its reliability and use in exiting applications.
There is so much regulation in place, that you can't just throw in new technology as it becomes available.

There's a lot of great science out there for Generation 3, 3+ and 4 reactors.
But many concepts aren't proven to the point that the regulatory bodies are comfortable with.
Not only that, with cheap energy sources and the pretty steep upfront costs of nuclear power, there's not a ton of motivation to further test and deploy these designs.
The public is horribly misinformed about nuclear power and radiation and its risks and so that adds another level of resistance against progress.
There's a ton of research ongoing at many universities (like mine!)
, labs and industry.
But taking designs and computer simulations to production is much more difficult.
A new nuclear design concept is WAY more difficult to build, test and verify than an airplane.
I hope we can solve these issues and continue pressing forward.
Nuclear power is a way better option than most current energy sources.

So who claims that nuclear power plants are dangerous due to their radiation?
The problems are: - No space for storage of the atomic waste.
I believe not one country in the world has as a sufficient solution for this problem.
-Atomic energy is expensive.
Look at the examples in England and Finland.
Almost never are plants build by private investors.
-Atomic power plants cannot supply energy in times of demand peaks and cannot decrease supply if too much energy is in the market.
With more and more renewable energy this will become increasingly important because the weather can change the energy production quite quickly.
- Nuclear plants are not 100 percent save.
There are always possibilities of a desaster.
I believe atomic energy is not a cost efficient solution but more used because of political reasons.
No dependency of certain countries... technological reputation of a country ...

Atomic waste in the United States is stupid because we do not reprocess our waste.
You see, 95% of nuclear waste consists of U-238, which is pretty inert from a radiation standpoint and actually used to cover our Abrams main battle tank as armor.
The remainder consists of elements that are useful for medical treatment, and only a small amount need to be disposed of in secure facilities.
The problem is that we gave up reprocessing in the eighties due to America stupidly thinking that this would make other countries not reprocess fuel to get plutonium, which can be used in a bomb.
However, fuel that has sat in a reactor for three years (the common refueling period for a civilian plant) will contain a lot of P-240 in addition to P-239.
While P-239 is useful for nuclear weaponry, the P-240 causes nuclear bombs to explode prematurely.
Separating the two is very difficult.
Thus, reprocessing civilian fuel is a hard way to get plutonium for a bomb.
(Military plants cycle fuel quickly through a reactor.
The long P-239 sits in a reactor, the higher the chance it will catch a neutron and become P-240.)
So, yeah, in the U.S., we could get rid of 95% of our nuclear waste if we weren't stupid.

Which is purely a political issue.
We can barely build a facility to reprocess surplus weapon-grade plutonium (see Mox Facility @ Savanna River Site).
Years behind schedule and almost shut down because of costs.

The politicians are fucking stupid.
The ban of nuclear reprocessing is purely political theater.
The guys who come up with nuclear energy are geniuses.
The failed plants were designed back in the sixties, and they failed in part due to operator error.
Newer designs would be much safer because they aren't susceptible to the failure conditions that plagued older designs.

I can disagree with some of your points kurtikurt.
Space for storage of spent fuel is controversial, not in my backyard type,  But that doesn't mean there isn't space to store it, it can be shielded and isolated from the public.
Nuclear is typically a base load generator which means it's always online and doesn't respond to peak changes.
This is what you want in an energy market where there is a known energy demand, while other sources of power are used to supplement when needed.
This is done because nuclear is carbon emission free and has a big effect on air quality.
It is expensive to build however it also creates many jobs and a boom to the local economy.
Reactor designs use a defense in depth strategy to protect against unintended consequences of human error also, generally they realize the importance of control, cool, contain principles.

Yes this is true: If you have lots of nuclear power you have some nice base load.
However, the reality in many countries is that more and more energy is produced my renewables.
In the future wind and solar will get more and more competitive and couintrie today which have lots of nuclear power might be "locked in nuclear" because their energy production is just not flexable enough for the high amounts of renewables.
Sure nulear has its benefits.
Especially no CO2 is promissing.

I'd have to see more examples then to prove solar and wind are really economically viable.
Our wind power is much more expensive (3 or 4x the price) and solar doesn't make a dent in our consumption.
Plus what other renewables are there.
Tidal power generation?
Biological digestion to produce methane?
I can't think of renewables that could ever reliably replace the base load that we need.

No space for storage of the atomic waste.
I believe not one country in the world has as a sufficient solution for this problem.
Why doesn't Yucca Mountain count?
It's only issue is political, namely people can't continue to bitch about nuclear waste if it were opened.
Atomic power plants cannot supply energy in times of demand peaks and cannot decrease supply if too much energy is in the market.
This is considered an advantage, as most power systems are not suitable for baseload generation like nuclear is.
With more and more renewable energy this will become increasingly important because the weather can change the energy production quite quickly.
and now it's become clear you don't know how a power grid works.
Nuclear plants are not 100 percent save.
There are always possibilities of a desaster.
So?
Windmills have killed people by flinging ice at them.
There isn't a safer form of power generation than nuclear.
I believe atomic energy is not a cost efficient solution but more used because of political reasons.
your belief is 100% backwards.

A lot  of people  claim their dangerous because of the radiation, and have an incredibly irrational fear of radiation.
.
If the US were to recycle like France does it would decrease  the amount of high level waste by about 90%; so the total amount of waste from all the years of operating  would fit in a football end zone 10 ft high.
So I don't think storing the waste is as big a concern as many would have us believe, because there's just not that much of it.
.
Atomic energy is expensive, as an up front cost, but once everything is built the cost for continued operation is small compared to coal or natural gas, in general.
I'm not sure what you mean by that they can't provide energy in times of peak demand, cause I can guarantee you that they do.
If you mean to say they can only produce a finite amount of power, you're correct, but the same can be said for all power plants.
You're also somewhat correct in saying that plants can't decrease power when it's not needed.
Current plants are not "load following" that is that they don't change their power based on demand.
However, this can be implemented if it were to get through regulations and would be beneficial for the use of small modular reactors.

What about the amount of water required?
And how do you justify the costs?
And who's comparing nuclear to coal and gas?
They're on their last legs.
And what about the costs of maintaining the reactor?
Consumers won't just be paying for the energy generated, they'll be paying to re-coup the construction costs, the generation and the continued maintenance.
How is this more efficient than the new technologies that are advancing every day?
And waste is a big problem.
That's not even taking into account any kind of mishap.
The fact that most disasters are the result of cost cutting, I don't think anyone can guarantee nuclear would be risk free.

There are many solutions for storage of atomic waste.
They just never are implemented because plants produce very little high-level waste (typical plant is 1 cubic meter per year).
Plants usually just store the waste (mostly spent fuel rods) in pools within the plants.
In the future, if necessary, the waste can be reprocessed into more nuclear fuel.
The largest cost in nuclear power is upfront--building the plant (about 80% of the total).
Once the plant is built, generation of power becomes incredibly cheap.
Fuel costs are almost insignificant, because nuclear plants don't use much fuel.
Atomic power plants cannot supply energy in times of demand peaks and cannot decrease supply if too much energy is in the market.
This doesn't make much sense.
Of course nuclear plants can't go over 100% capacity (this is pretty intuitive).
They can reduce the speed of the reaction and generate less power though.

As to the waste issue the designs for Molten Salt Reactors often state they will preferentially use nuclear "waste" as fuel because it still has most of its energy content.
The waste that remains is a much smaller volume (~1%) and has a much shorter half-life (~30 years).
Unfortunately it looks like we'll have to wait 20 years for the Chinese to develop them.

This doesn't make much sense.
Of course nuclear plants can't go over 100% capacity (this is pretty intuitive).
They can reduce the speed of the reaction and generate less power though.
It's generally considered unsafe to operate a nuclear reactor in transient, as the models determining reactivity due to Xe-135 can become unstable.
(See: Chernobyl)  It's been a long time since I've studied reactor physics, though.
As such, nuclear plant operators like to get it to critical, set it to 100%, then run it at 100%.
Some power profiles are technically impossible to run: e.g. powering off the reactor for 1-2 days and then restarting it (due to Xe-135 poison).
There's just no reason to ever turn the reactor to a lower power level when you could just throw away the energy.
The uranium cost is basically nothing compared to the problem of operating a reactor safely in transient.

So who claims that nuclear power plants are dangerous due to their radiation?
Almost no one on reddit, but most Americans are uninformed on this matter.
The issue of expanding our nuclear power capabilities is largely political; if more people understood how green nuclear really is, we would be building more reactors and we wouldn't be talking so damn much about global warming.
We should probably thank Obama for closing down Yucca Mountain in 2009 to expedite solar and wind energy expansion; working well so far.

A traveling-wave reactor (TWR) is a type of nuclear reactor that nuclear engineers anticipate can convert fertile material into usable fuel through nuclear transmutation in tandem with the burnup of fissile material.
TWRs differ from other kinds of fast-neutron and breeder reactors in their ability to use fuel efficiently without uranium enrichment or reprocessing, instead directly using depleted uranium, natural uranium, thorium, spent fuel removed from light water reactors, or some combination of these materials.
Edit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor
Breeder reactors could, in principle, extract almost all of the energy contained in uranium or thorium, decreasing fuel requirements by a factor of 100 compared to widely-used once-through light water reactors, which extract less than 1% of the energy in the uranium mined from the earth
With increased concerns about nuclear waste, breeding fuel cycles became interesting again because they can reduce actinide wastes, particularly plutonium and minor actinides.
[12] Breeder reactors are designed to fission the actinide wastes as fuel, and thus convert them to more fission products.
A reactor whose main purpose is to destroy actinides, rather than increasing fissile fuel stocks, is sometimes known as a burner reactor.
Both breeding and burning depend on good neutron economy, and many designs can do either.
Breeding designs surround the core by a breeding blanket of fertile material.
Waste burners surround the core with non-fertile wastes to be destroyed.
Some designs add neutron reflectors or absorbers.
In the past breeder reactor development focused on reactors with low breeding ratios, from 1.01 for the Shippingport Reactor[21][22] running on thorium fuel and cooled by conventional light water to over 1.2 for the Russian BN-350 liquid-metal-cooled reactor.
[23] Theoretical models of breeders with liquid sodium coolant flowing through tubes inside fuel elements ("tube-in-shell" construction) suggest breeding ratios of at least 1.8 are possible
Anybody who tells you waste is a super mega problem is uneducated and is probably just repeating someones opinion based on gut instinct or outdated info.

Traveling wave reactors do not exist yet.
In fact, a commercial TWR power plant may still be 50 years away, which happens to be a decent estimate for the first commercial fusion power plant.
So fusion and TWR are the same distance away.
Meanwhile fusion actually has the interest of various national governments, while TWR only has Bill Gates.
Which means I might as well put this here, since it's equally justified, if not more so, as a "solution" to the nuclear waste "problem".

No space for storage of the atomic waste.
I believe not one country in the world has as a sufficient solution for this problem
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing
Read up, it's possible to separate the usable fuel from the nuclear waste and recycle it.
This substantially reduces the volume of waste, and the fission products with short half lives can be put in deep storage, where they decay to safe levels in decades instead of millennia.
The problem is that it's more expensive than simply storing all the waste as it is.
With reprocessing and breeder reactors we could substantially cut down on how much waste we have to store, just have to get over people's irrational fear of nuclear power.

The Japanese had no choice but to build in an earthquake zone because that's where they're located.
They have to use nuclear power because they don't have oil, coal, or natural gas.
They built the plants close to the water to eliminate the need for giant cooling towers; they used the sea for cooling the plant.
The problem is that the reactors that blew up used an antiquated design that generated heat for days after a full SCRAM (shutdown).
(I believe they were boiling water reactors.)
This means that in order to prevent a meltdown, external energy was required.
A turning point in the crisis was when the operators turned off a self-cooling system in Reactor 1.
When the tsunami hit, they were unable to turn it back on.
The diesel backups were flooded, then they were unable to keep the reactor cool.
The fuel got hot, melted down, and then the zirconium created hydrogen that led to an explosion.
Nuclear "disasters" have only a few causes, and most can be avoided.
There have been meltdowns where there was no release of radiation.
The plant may need to be rebuilt, but no one dies.
However, the disasters come from (1) steam explosions (Chernobyl); (2) hydrogen explosions (Fukishima); and (3) criticality incidents.
(1) Steam Explosions.
Most reactors need coolant to prevent meltdown.
If water is used as a coolant, you may face steam explosions.
Sometimes a void occurs and the energy too much, and then steam builds up and explodes.
Scientists have been exploring molten salts or other coolants that operate at a higher temperature but work at room pressure.
Even in an emergency, the coolant cannot explode.
However, most plants are water cooled.
Hopefully, newer generations will avoid these flaws.
(2) Hydrogen Explosions.
We use zirconium to cover our fuel rods.
If the zirconium gets too hot, it liberates hydrogen from the water.
This leads to an explosion if it gets to build up too much.
Then boom.
Newer designs should avoid zirconium.
Basically, we have to avoid water.
(3) Criticality Incidents.
Uranium or plutonium may be suspended in liquid for various reasons, such as refining, fuel processing, or the like.
If neutrons get to build up too much, then radiation will be spontaneously released as the products undergo fission.
It's weird.
If a certain amount of liquid is stored in a long pipe, then it may not fission because the neutrons are leaking too fast.
But poor that into a spherical object, and the neutrons will have to pass through fission material before they can escape, and fission occurs.
This will not cause an explosion, but the megadose of neutrons will kill everyone nearby.
You see the picture of the Japanese man who suffered full-body burns; well, that was a criticality incident.
The problem is that we have put all of our eggs onto water-cooled reactors.
We need to invest in other solutions.
I don't know if that will happen.

SCRAM.
An acronym from the first human developed nuclear reactor under the stadium at the University of Chicago.
They wanted to make certain that they could stop the chain reaction if it went supercritical.
They had control rods suspended above the reactor that could use gravity to fall into the core and absorb neutrons to shutdown the process.
The control rods were held in place by a rope through a pulley and then attached to a wall.
A guy had an axe at the ready to cut the rope so the rods would fall into the pile.

modern reactors have many more layers of security and basically won't ever meltdown
Reactors need to cool.
Flood a nuclear plant and disable the on-site generators and you lose the water pumps.
No water pumps = no cooling.
And the simple fact is that some nuclear plants in the U.S. are very much at risk for flooding.

I know for Naval reactors the core design is such that as long as the core is covered in water, that will provide sufficient cooling capacity as to avoid core damage from overheating/meltdown with the reactor shut down.
I say shut down because the primary danger of meltdown in these situations is unchecked decay heat and not operating at power
So I would assume civilian reactors are made with similar design qualities, where just keeping the reactor flooded provides sufficient heat transfer to prevent real damage to the core

There are several instances of reactors melting down despite being SCRAMmed.
Fukashima is an obvious example but being older reactors.
Generation II nuclear plants are designed to maintain the core with "active" safety systems - i.e. electricity or some other method of providing water is needed.
Gen III reactors can safely cool without an active cooling system.
Most of the reactors in the U.S. and world are Gen II.

Perhaps if you stuck it out you would have learned that the light water reactor design, while relatively safe when built at the scale to power a submarine and used in that environment (not to mention using entirely mil-spec components), is not nearly so safe when scaled up and used for land-based applications.
Couple this with serious cost-cutting in the design of land-based reactors and the use of non-specified materials (gotta love mob-controlled concrete plants) you have a recipe for disaster.

Neither does this paper by the same author.

If you are not understanding that I suggest you read the references cited.
You might also want to check the list of civilian nuclear accidents:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilian_nuclear_accidents
It is also worth noting that that the cleanup costs for Fukushima (a US designed facility) are estimated to top $250 billion by the time they are completed.
So yes, I would indeed say that we.
have vastly different definitions of the word "disaster."

How much of that $250 billion (which doesn't really have a respectable reference) is to clean up the results of the most powerful earthquake in recorded Japanese history?
The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami killed almost 20,000 people.
That's a real disaster.
Air pollution kills 7 million people a year .
That's a Tohoku earthquake per day every day.
That is my definition of a disaster.
So yes, lets shut down all nuclear power because a 40-year old plant failed during one of the worst natural disasters in recorded history and killed no people.
( Fukushima Daiini was also hit by the tsunami and it was fine by the way.)
Instead, we can build lots of coal plants (which have accidents more often ) and lots of coal mines (which have even more accidents ).
The only other option is rolling blackouts worldwide.
That would also be a disaster.

Then you don't know a whole lot about nuclear reactor design.
Safety is the first, second, third, and fourth concern.
Defense in depth is a first year nuclear engineering school concept.
Plant operators are petrified of changing anything in case it affects their safety disk or violates their license.
If cost was prioritized over safety, we'd be having a lot more accidents.

And in case you are forgetting, none of the reactors currently on-line started construction after 1977, using designs older than that.

How much does it cost?
The answer is, nobody knows.
After building the plant, and running it for 40 years, you are left with the problem of what to do with the waste, which will need to be looked after for a thousand years or more.
Nuclear proponents neglect to factor that cost in, partially because it is unknown.
Yucca mountain was supposed to solve this problem for the US, but it has been plagued with problems.
Not factoring in the cost of waste sequestration into the price is terribly misleading.

No.
If you work out the amount of energy you get from a particular mass of fissile material, and subtract the amount of energy we currently require to get that mass to escape velocity, you would find that it's a bad idea.

There are only two kinds of power generation that does not involve making steam to spin turbines and thats wind and hydro-electric.
When I was a kid I thought that in nuclear power they converted the nuclear substances directly into electricity.
It was kind of hilarious to learn that they just used the stuff to boil water to spin turbines.
I hope one day there is a way to turn nuclear energy directly into electricity.

Problem is not death.
It's huge loss of land as a factor of production.
Nuclear disasters fuck up the environment like no other.
Makes place literally uninhabitable for centuries.
Not to mention it's very inefficient compared to other sources of electricity, since most of the heat generated by fission will escape into the atmosphere, as opposed to actually generating electricity.

we need nuclear power until we are capable of creating fusion reactors but we need to use thorium not uranium... here is an essay I just wrote on it yesterday.
Thorium vs Uranium
Thorium, discovered in 1829, is a radioactive actinide metal and one of only three radioactive elements that still occurs in quantity in nature as a primordial element.
Currently Thorium is considered one of the best nuclear energy sources for the world beating uranium in efficiency but we don’t use it today mostly because uranium had more desirable byproducts during the cold war era like plutonium-239.
Because of this we never developed thorium reactors but it is still both economically and environmentally beneficial to create thorium reactors and here are just a few reasons why.
The reason that many people don’t like using uranium reactors is because of the highly radioactive byproducts it creates like isotopes of americium, technetium, iodine and plutonium which all have half lives of thousands of years.
These byproducts also need to be housed for ten thousand years, which is a waste of money.
Thorium doesn’t create as harmful byproducts and the ones it does have half lives of only a few hundred years.
Thorium can also use existing nuclear waste as fuel for it’s initial fissile start up charge, which is an effective way of getting rid of some of our uranium byproducts.
Thorium is also much safer then uranium.
Thorium on its own is not fissile; to get it to react you need throw neutrons at it which will make it start splitting and exploding and that’s very beneficial because this means you can shut the entire proses down if there is a threat of a melt down.
Thorium doesn’t create dangerous byproducts like plutonium-239 either, so this means that it could be a safe power source for countries like North Korea and Iran who may secretly build weapons of mass destruction with a uranium powered nuclear reactor.
Thorium is approximately three times more abundant in the earths crust then uranium and you need much less of it to produce the same amount of energy (1 ton of thorium = 250 tons of uranium).
Thorium is also much less expensive to mine then uranium because it’s found in much higher concentrations in the earths crust saving both money and the environment since mines would not need to be as large.
Because of this Thorium in the long run is a much better economic investment then uranium and could potentially save countries lots of money in both fuel and extraction costs.
Because Thorium is much safer and cheaper it would be a much better choice then continuing to use uranium for nuclear power; at least until we can create working fusion reactors which still may be another 50-70 years.
So if we invest in thorium now it would make a lot more sense then continuing to use uranium.
edit: I wasn't calming to be completely 100% correct on any of this.
I was given 3 really shitty articles in my gr 11 english class and asked to write an essay on which nuclear power seemed better in the long run for our economy.
this is the just of what I got from the articles which already had very little information so don't hate, I just thought I would share what I learned.
also for anyone curious, the names of the articles were: Don't believe the spin on thorium being a greener nuclear option, is thorium the biggest breakthrough since fire?
possibly and The thing about thorium: why the better nuclear fuel may not get a chance

Part of your paper is false.
The Thorium decay cycle does create some amount of U-232, which decays into Tl-208.
Tl-208 releases a wicked strong 2.6 MeV photon upon decay, which makes it much more dangerous in the short term.
Also, you can extract the U-232 from the Thorium waste and use it to make bombs - so it's a proliferation concern, too.

Your last statement is not correct.
U-232 actually enhances non-proliferation because of the radioactive decay products it produces.
Anyone building a nuke using U-232 will have a really hard time.
You might as well use U-233, which is the main fissile element bred from thorium and is also not as radioactive.

U232 is mostly produced by an (n,2n) reaction on U233 or Pa233.
Th232 decays to Ra228.
U232 is also not fissile or fissionable so it can't be used for a bomb.

You are correct in part - a Thorium sample has an amount of Pa-232 impurities, which is where you get the U-232 from.
It is most certainly fissionable, just not as readily as other Uranium isotopes.
I also misspoke - U-233 is the proliferation concern as Pa-233 can readily be separated from the Thorium reaction.

Currently Thorium is considered one of the best nuclear energy sources for the world beating uranium in efficiency
Efficiency?
What kind of efficiency and where are you getting this?
Thorium is much less efficient on neutrons.
but we don’t use it today mostly because uranium had more desirable byproducts during the cold war era like plutonium-239.
We don't use thorium today because uranium is still very cheap.
The reason that many people don’t like using uranium reactors is because of the highly radioactive byproducts it creates like isotopes of americium, technetium, iodine and plutonium which all have half lives of thousands of years.
Americium and plutonium are produced by neutron captures in uranium.
Technetium and iodine are fission products.
U233 fission (i.e. thorium) also produces those fission products.
These byproducts also need to be housed for ten thousand years, which is a waste of money.
It's actually hundreds of thousands to millions of years.
Thorium doesn’t create as harmful byproducts and the ones it does have half lives of only a few hundred years.
This is completely false.
Thorium can also use existing nuclear waste as fuel for it’s initial fissile start up charge, which is an effective way of getting rid of some of our uranium byproducts.
Thorium fuel can use waste as fuel?
Not sure what you're getting at here.
Thorium is also much safer then uranium.
Thorium on its own is not fissile; to get it to react you need throw neutrons at it which will make it start splitting and exploding
I'm sorry, but you don't know what you're talking about.
Thorium 232 absorbs a neutron, transmutes to thorium 233, which decays to protactinium 233, which decays to uranium 233.
The actual fuel in a thorium reactor is still uranium.
You need to dope thorium fuel with a fissile component because it can't fission by itself.
Most reactor designs that incorporate thorium start with a large quantity of plutonium or enriched uranium.
and that’s very beneficial because this means you can shut the entire proses down if there is a threat of a melt down.
No.
Thorium doesn’t create dangerous byproducts like plutonium-239 either
Pu239 isn't dangerous.
It's a fissile nuclide like U235 and U233.
You could use any of the three of them for a nuclear bomb.
So if we invest in thorium now it would make a lot more sense then continuing to use uranium.
Uranium is currently very cheap.
A thorium fuel cycle would actually be very expensive to run because we don't have industrial reprocessing infrastructure.
It also needs an initial fissile component that is expensive to acquire (and has a large number of licensing and proliferation issues.)
I think you're confusing thorium fuel and the molten salt reactor in many spots.
Thorium can be used in many types of reactors and molten salt reactors can run on fuel other than thorium.
They are not synonymous.
Molten salt reactors are an old technology, but there aren't any large scale designs currently ready for deployment.
Even if there were, nobody is going to shut down their existing plants that are running perfectly fine to build a new reactor type that they have no experience operating.
Overall, your enthusiasm is great (and I'm a thorium fuel cycle proponent myself) but you really need to read a bit more about the topic before you can properly advocate it.

Did you mention that all currently known uranium resources would only supply enough power for ten years at current levels of energy use?
[edit: using conventional uranium mining techniques and light-water reactor designs.]

Reddit isn't a person.
I lived right near three mile Island,  when it happened and I'm pro nuke.
More people are irradiated every day from coal than from all nuclear accidents.

All it takes is one.
One accident to screw up or end tens of thousands of lives, maybe more.
And no one is discussing the waste.
As soon as nuclear energy can be replaced, it should be, just like coal.
There's a low risk for any issues, but the potential issue that could arise is catastrophic.

This is probably a very different question than the ones others have asked, but what kinds of classes did you take and how challenging was it for you?
I am asking as a high school junior, and I want to be an engineer, but I don't know what I want to do specifically yet.

Why can't we tap the actual energy in a nuclear rod/device rather than just let it steam up and run a turbine?
.
I suspect there is a thread about this, but could not find one.

The fuel rod won't become active until it is inserted into the reactor.

I believe what you're asking is why we use steam generation to produce electricity?
Well, first you have to understand that the 'actual energy' being produced by fission is, for the most part, a combination of EM particles and heat.
What we care about is the heat being released by fission because we have ways of turning that thermal power into electric power via the steam cycle.
Truthfully we are not retaining all of the energy we could from a nuclear reaction, but from an engineering standpoint, boiling water to run a turbine is pretty efficient.

Yes this.
I am obviously ignorant in this subject.
It seems like we should be able to tap that fission reaction for the power being generated instead of letting it produce heat to boil water.
seems like a 1st generation nuclear power plant idea.
We should have volved to be at more direct connection to the energy being produced.

Even fusion reactors are planned to produce power on a conventional coolant --> turbine plant.
We really don't have any better way of producing electricity from heat at the moment.
You can use CO2, molten salt, molten sodium or lead instead, but at the end of the day you have to heat some sort of coolant and use that to produce steam and spin a turbine.
There's just no better way.

Thinking of a solar panel.
We have discovered solar panels that change sunlight to electrical current without any moving parts.
Why haven't we discovered something similar to convert that Fission energy directly to electrical current or similar?

Photovoltaic cells absorb photons (light) and produce electrons, which go to an electrode and this produces electricity.
You could hypothetically do this with gamma rays (also photons) from the decay products of the fuel.
The problem is
a) photovoltaic cells are actually very inefficient
b) they'd be very VERY damaged by neutron irradiation very quickly
c) The majority of power produced by nuclear fission is in the form of kinetic energy (heat) not gamma rays
You might be interested in radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) which are used to power satellites.
These aren't feasible for large scale electricity production though.
Really the problem at the end of the day is that there's no more efficient process for heat --> electricity that humans have invented yet.

Imagine having slaves mine a heavy metals out of there earth, that are worth more than gold; and then sell it to the 'developed' world, just to burn it.
Resulting in unending waste that is harmful to everything.

Nuclear Energy Explained: How does it work? (2015) - A short film about the current State of Nuclear power plants in the world.
I'm not wrong.

    By the end of the war, following an idea of Alvin Weinberg, natural uranium fuel elements were arranged in a lattice in ordinary water at the top of the X10 reactor to evaluate the neutron multiplication factor.[3] The purpose of this experience was to determine the feasibility of a nuclear reactor using light water as a moderator and coolant, and cladded solid uranium as fuel. The results showed that, with a lightly enriched uranium, criticality could be reached.[4] This experience was the first practical step toward light water reactor.

The X-10 reactor was part of the Manhattan project and constructed and funded with the intent to produce the isotopes needed to research and constrct a nuclear bomb. This was before submarines was even thought of.

    When President Roosevelt in December 1942 authorized the Manhattan Project, the Oak Ridge site in eastern Tennessee had already been obtained for the Clinton Engineer Works and plans had been laid for establishing an air-cooled experimental pile, a pilot chemical separation plant, and support facilities. The X-10 Graphite Reactor, designed and built in ten months, went into operation on November 4, 1943. The reactor used neutrons emitted in the fission of uranium-235 to convert uranium-238 into a new element, plutonium-239.

And it doesn't really matter because just as /u/pocketknifeMT pointed out, my main point was that nuclear energy research was funded by war efforts, not because a benevolent state wanted free energy for their citizens, and submarines are war machines.

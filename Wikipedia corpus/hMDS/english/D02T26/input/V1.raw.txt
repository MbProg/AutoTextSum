(Site Profile/Docket Number 222)
On this Page
Special Exposure Cohort
Public Comments
Location: Oak Ridge, Tennessee
Also Known As: Oak Ridge Area, Oak Ridge Reservation
Special Exposure Cohort Petition Information
The Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) is a unique category of employees established by the Act ( 42 CFR Part 83 ). Claims compensated under the SEC do not have to go through the dose reconstruction process. To qualify for compensation under the SEC, a covered employee must meet specific requirements (e.g., must have at least one of 22 " specified cancers ," and have worked for a specified time period at one of the SEC sites). Classes of employees and work sites can be considered for addition to the SEC through a NIOSH petition process. More information about the Special Exposure Cohort can be found on our Frequently Asked Questions page.

To date, there are no open/active SEC petitions from Clinton Engineer Works.

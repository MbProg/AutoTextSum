Execution by elephant was a common method of capital punishment in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in India, where Asian elephants were used to crush, dismember, or torture captives in public executions.
The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period.
Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's absolute power and his ability to control wild animals.

Caption: L'execution par elephant Engraving by Chedel from a drawing by Benard published in a French edition of Prevost's Histoire Generale Des Voyages, Printed Chez Didot, 1750. Execution by elephant was a cruel method of capital punishment commonly used in South and Southeast Asia, and particularly in India. Asian elephants were used to torture captives in public executions as here shown. European travellers were fascinated and appalled. the Practice was suppressed by the European empires that colonised the region in the 18th and 19th centuries.

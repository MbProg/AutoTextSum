I (shamefully) will admit that between the time Jefferies was arrested and by the time he was let go, I think I was one of the people who were like "He must've done it, he looks the type".
I know that's an indecent thing to say but I think at the time, it was kind of playing out like a soap opera style!
It's also quite ironic that Jefferies name/face seems more attached to the story than the actual killer, so much focus was on Jefferies.
That describes very well what happened really.
It was played out as if the characters were fictional when of course they were real people.
It was almost as if it were a game.

I remember getting ready to go to a family boxing day gathering thing and seeing it on the news and we were talking about it.
I felt very sad for her family but also relieved they had an answer.
Quite a lot happened in a short space of time really.
She went missing on December 17 and her body was found on Christmas Day.
A terrible case and probably one that got extra attention because of the time of year and the fact it's normally a slow news period.
I do hope this drama doesn't upset the family too much - but it's a story that needs telling.
The poor police investigation and most importantly the trial-by-media almost robbed the family of justice.

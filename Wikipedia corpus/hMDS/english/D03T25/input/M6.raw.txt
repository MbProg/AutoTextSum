Horse Protection Act: P.L. 91-540 (December 9,1970), as amended, makes it a crime to exhibit, or transport for the purpose of exhibiting, any "sored" horse, which is one whose feet have been injured deliberately to accentuate the animalâ€™s gait. APHIS enforces the law, which covers all breeds, although Tennessee Walking Horses are the most frequent subjects of this procedure.

Horse Protection Act: P.L. 91-540 (December 9,1970),  as amended, makes it a crime to exhibit, or transport for the purpose of  exhibiting, any "sored" horse, which is one whose feet have been injured  deliberately to accentuate the animal’s gait. APHIS enforces the law, which covers all breeds, although Tennessee Walking Horses are  the most frequent subjects of this procedure.

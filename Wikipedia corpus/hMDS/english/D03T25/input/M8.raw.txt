The author completely overlooks or fails to mention, the USDA is charged with enforcement of the Horse Protection Act, including civil penalties of fines and suspensions as well as the power to pursue felony prosecution for violating the Horse Protection Act. All HIOs are obligated tof notify the USDA of the shows they will be performing inspections at and follow up post show with turning over evidence collected to the USDA. The USDA can prosecute based on either evidence collected by themselves at shows they attend or evidence turned over by the HIOs (see USDA vs Barney Davis, Eastern District of Tennessee).
Most HIOs do assess fines and suspensions for violation of rules. Basically, every person who is suspected of abuse is subject to HIO fines and suspensions AND prosecution by the USDA.
Perhaps holding the USDA accountable for not being transparent would be a good start at ensuring a federal law is equally applied to all breeds and equally enforced, rather than putting the blame on Horse Industry Organizations, especially if you bear in mind itâ€™s the USDA that is responsible for certification of HIOs and the fact they have the power to decertify ineffective or corrupt HIOs.

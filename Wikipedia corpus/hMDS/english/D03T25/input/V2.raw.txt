SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background
The practice known as "soring" causes a horse to suffer pain in any of its limbs for the purpose of affecting its performance in the show ring. In 1970, Congress passed the Horse Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1821-1831), referred to below as the Act, to eliminate the practice of soring by prohibiting the showing, selling, or transporting of sored horses. Exercising its rulemaking authority under the Act, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) enforces regulations in 9 CFR part 11, referred to below as the regulations, that prohibit devices and methods that might sore horses.
In 1979, in response to an amendment to the Act, we established regulations under which show management must, to avoid liability for any sore horses that are shown, appoint individuals trained to conduct preshow inspections to detect or diagnose sored horses. These individuals, referred to as designated qualified persons (DQP's), are trained and licensed under industry-sponsored DQP programs that we certify and monitor. The requirements for DQP programs and licensing of DQP's are set forth in § 11.7 of the regulations.
Section 11.7 also requires that we publish a current list of horse industry organizations that have certified DQP programs and a list of licensed DQP's in the Federal Register at least once each year. The list reads as follows:

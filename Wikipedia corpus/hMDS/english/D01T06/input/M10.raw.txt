The Last Judgment altarpiece sometimes the Beaune altarpiece) is a large polyptych painted c. 1445â€“50 by the Early Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden. It was executed in oil on oak panel, though parts have been transferred to canvas. The altarpiece was commissioned for the Hospices de Beaune in 1443 by Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, and his wife Guigone de Salins who is buried in the chapel, in front of the altarpiece's original positioning.[1][2] It remains there today although not in its original position.
The polyptych is badly damaged through paint loss, wearing and darkening of colours, accumulated dirt and has suffered from poorly choosen restorer's over-paint. At some some point the outer panels were cut apart so both sides could be shown simultaneously. Traditionally the inner wings would only be displayed on selected Sundays or church holidays
The work comprises 15 panels, nine on the inner and five on the outer views. It retains its original outer frames. The inner panels are arranged in two registers. The large central panel spans both and shows Christ seated in Judgement, perched on a rainbow with his feet resting on a golden globe. He sits above the Archangel Michael who holds a scale as he weighs souls. The panel on Christ's far right show the gates of heaven, that to his far left the entrance to hell. The panels of the lower register form a continuous landscape, with figures moving from the central panel to their final destination after their judgement. This overlap is considered one of the greatest innovations of the work. Detail. Rogier van Weyden. Wonderful.

Interpretation          of Merode Altarpiece
Background
The fifteenth century Flemish oil          painting known as the Merode Altarpiece (c.1425), is a domestic altarpiece painted by the          Flemish artist Robert Campin (1378-1444), also known as the Master of          Flemalle. Taking its name from the aristocratic Merode family of Belgium          who owned it during the nineteenth century, this masterpiece of Christian          art from the early Northern          Renaissance consists of three panel          paintings , and depicts the moment when the archangel Gabriel announces          to the Virgin Mary that she has been chosen by God to be the mother of          Jesus. Now in the Metropolitan          Museum of Art (Cloisters), New York, the work is also known as The          Annunciation Triptych.
 
 
More Analysis of Merode Altarpiece
The Merode Altarpiece is relatively          small in size, measuring roughly 4 feet in width by 2 feet in height,          and like the earlier Seilern (Entombment)          Triptych , was designed as a private devotional piece for use in          the home. It consists of three hinged panels (triptych format): the left          panel depicts the donor and his wife; the central and most important panel          shows the Annunciation itself, and its two main characters, Mary and Archangel          Gabriel; the right panel portrays Joseph in his workshop. The triptych is unsigned and undated, and only since the early 20th century has Robert          Campin been identified as its creator, albeit with help from his assistants,          one of whom may have been his greatest pupil Roger          van der Weyden (1400-64).
Analysis, Meaning, Interpretation
The most radical feature of the painting is its domestic setting. The Annunciation is the starting point          for the Christian story of salvation, and to mark its significance, Gothic          and Early Renaissance painters traditionally set it in a palace or church,          commonly against a golden background. Campin, however, sets the scene          in an urban, middle class house.
Reflecting perhaps the teachings of the          Franciscan Order, whose monks took care to interpret the Bible in terms          that their listeners understood and could relate to, an approach which          was especially popular in Northern Europe, Campin amplifies the domestic          nature of the scene and keeps religious conventions and formalities to          a minimum. Thus neither Mary nor the Archangel wear halos. There is no          dove to represent the Holy Ghost. Instead, Campin places Mary in a comfortable          well-sized room (albeit slightly claustrophic due to the exaggerated perspectival          recession he uses) along with a table, a bench running the length of one          wall, windows and fireplace. Details are lovingly recorded, including          how the wooden bench and ceiling have been constructed.
Theological Symbolism
Even so, the Annunciation scene is filled          with symbols of theological importance. Above Gabriel's wings, a tiny          naked figure of a child - symbolizing the body and soul of Jesus - is          being transported on seven golden rays of light from one of the living          room windows. He carries a cross, a sombre reminder of his sacrificial          destiny. The white lilies, the vessel of water and the white towel all          allude to Mary's purity - the small windows at the side of the room and          the half-closed windows at the back, emphasizing the enclosed, virginal          life she follows. The recently extinguished candle may be an allusion          to either the sudden entrance of an invisible presence like the Holy Ghost,          or the idea that the light emitted by the candle flame is no match for          Christ's divine radiance.
Joseph
Domesticity runs over into the right hand          panel, where Mary's Joseph is pictured working in his carpentry workshop.          The tools and other details of his trade are meticulously rendered. They          are also hugely symbolic: the saw refers to the implement that St Peter          used to cut off the ear of Malchus, during Christ's betrayal and arrest;          the log alludes to the cross of the crucifixion; the nails, hammers, chisels,          pliers and screwdrivers are all likely references to the instruments of          the Passion. The meaning of the mouse-trap on Joseph's table remains obscure.          Art experts believe it may allude to St Augustine's description of Jesus          being the devil's mouse-trap.
Although Campin's portrayal of Joseph is          deliberately intended to show respect for artisan values and the virtues          of the Christian citizen, his wooden workshop is a poor comparison with          Mary's better stone-built living space, while the lack of communicating          doors excludes him from the sacred event taking place. The window in Joseph's          room overlooks a city square containing numerous houses, churches and          shops. Possible locations include Liege, Ghent, Tournai (Campin's home)          or even Mechelen (the home of the donor).
One final point to note is that according          to traditional Catholic gospel dogma, Joseph (the father of six children          by a previous marriage) was only Mary's betrothed, not her husband. Moreover,          the couple did not co-habit. Campin's pictorial rendering of their domestic          situation is therefore almost unique, in the history of art.
The Donor
In the left panel, we see pictures of the          donor and his wife, kneeling piously. These were added later, possibly          because the triptych was painted before their marriage. In the background          behind them, with the straw hat, stands the Mechelen town crier. The identity          of the donor remains unconfirmed: research centres around the coats-of-arms          in the windows of the central panel. According to the present owners of          the work, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the donor was Jan          Engelbrecht, a prosperous businessman. However, according to the German art historian Felix Thurlemann, the patron was the Cologne-born cloth          merchant Peter Inghelbrecht/Engelbrecht. The translation of Engelbrecht          is "angel brings", suggesting a family reason for commissioning          an Annunciation. In any event, the work seems to have been a pious request          for a family, commissioned to celebrate a forthcoming marriage.
Robert Campin, Master of Flemalle
The Merode Altarpiece remains one          of Campin's best-known religious          paintings , and is ranked amongst the greatest          Renaissance paintings of Northern Europe. Netherlandish painting in          the early 15th century represented a radical break from the courtly International          Gothic style, and introduced a far more realist approach. Note for          example the stunningly lifelike rendering of the drapery of the robes          worn by the Virgin Mary, Archangel Gabriel and Joseph. Campin, together          with Jan van Eyck (1390-1441),          was a co-founder of Flemish          painting . By way of a final thought, there is a curious and unexpected          affinity between the rather primitive style of perspective which Campin          uses in the Merode Altarpiece, and that employed in the 20th century Cubism of Georges Braque and          Pablo Picasso.

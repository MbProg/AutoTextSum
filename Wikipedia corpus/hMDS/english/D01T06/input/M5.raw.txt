Interpretation of Merode Altarpiece 
Background

The fifteenth century Flemish oil painting known as the Merode Altarpiece (c.1425), is a domestic altarpiece painted by the Flemish artist Robert Campin (1378-1444), also known as the Master of Flemalle. Taking its name from the aristocratic Merode family of Belgium who owned it during the nineteenth century, this masterpiece of Christian art from the early Northern Renaissance consists of three panel paintings, and depicts the moment when the archangel Gabriel announces to the Virgin Mary that she has been chosen by God to be the mother of Jesus. Now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Cloisters), New York, the work is also known as The Annunciation Triptych.

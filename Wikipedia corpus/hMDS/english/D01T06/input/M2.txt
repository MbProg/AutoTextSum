The six outer panels with the kneeling donors on either side.
The Last Judgment (or The Beaune altarpiece) is a very large polyptych altarpiece painted c. 1445-50 by Rogier van der Weyden.
It was executed in oil on oak panel, though parts have been transferred to canvas.
The work consists of 15 panels, of which nine are contained in the inner and five on the outer views.
It retains its original outer frames.
The altarpiece was commissioned for the Hospices de Beaune in 1443 by Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of Burgundy, and his wife Guigone de Salins who was buried in the chapel, in front of the altarpiece's original positioning.
[1][2] It remains there today although not in its original position.
It is badly damaged through paint loss, darkening of colours, dirt and restorer's over-paint.
At the time, hospitals were largely for the dying, and the spiritual care of patients was at least as important as the treatments of physical ailments.
Thus the work served as a moralising reminder for the sick to consider their faith and direct their final thoughts towards the divine.

Summary
Few cities, ' Jan Morris observes, 'have been much more loved, loathed, and celebrated.'
This book has become a classic account of the character, history, mores, buildings, climate, and people of one of Britain's most fascinating cities. '
A book of outstanding excellence, with a sweep of knowledge and a distinction of style such as I have never before encountered in a work of this sort ... Brilliant alike in observation and imagination ... brings the very stones of Oxford to life'Sunday Telegraph.

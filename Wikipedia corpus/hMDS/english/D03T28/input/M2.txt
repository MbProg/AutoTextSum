Dorotheus
Roman jurist
Dorotheus, (flourished 6th century ad) jurist, one of the principal codifiers of Roman law under the emperor Justinian I.
Dorotheus helped to compile the Digest, or Pandects (published in 533), and the second edition of the Codex Constitutionum (published in 534).
With Tribonian (Tribonianus), head of the Digestâ€™s compilers, and Theophilus, he also prepared the Institutes (533) as an introduction to the Digest.
Fragments of his Index (542), a commentary on the Digest, are preserved in the 9th-century law code called the Basilica.
Dorotheus taught jurisprudence in the school of Roman law at Berytus, Syria (now Beirut, Lebanon), at that time probably the best law school in the eastern Roman Empire.

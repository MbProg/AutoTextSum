CV
Dr. Hall has written the definitive history of Roman Beirut which from the time of Augustus to Justinian was a center of the study of Roman law.
Her book presents a full portrait of the city–its economy, religious transformation from pagan to Christian, and the population’s occupations as artisans, merchants and legal experts.
She also has researched the neighboring city of Tyre, the importance of the emperor Septimius Severus, and the social evidence of legal texts, like the Theodosian Code.
Dr. Hall’s other major research area focuses on the conversion of the Emperor Constantine as evidenced in 4th century texts ranging from the writings of Eusebius and a figural poet named Publilius Optatianus Porfyrius.

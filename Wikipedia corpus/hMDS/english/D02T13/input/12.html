            (May 5, 1873&nbsp;– October 29, 1901; also used surname &quot;Nieman&quot; and 
            variations thereof) was the assassin of U.S. President William 
            McKinley. In the last few years of his life, he claimed to have been 
            heavily influenced by anarchists such as Emma Goldman and Alexander 
            Berkman.</p>
			<p align="justify"><b>Early life</b></p>
			<p align="justify">Czolgosz was born in Alpena, Michigan in 1873, 
            one of eight children (six boys and two girls) of Mary (née Nowak) 
            and Paul Czolgosz, Polish Catholic immigrants from Prussia.</p>
          <p align="justify">According to a different source, Czolgosz's 
          ancestors were immigrants from what is now Belarus. His father might 
          have emigrated to the US in the 1860s from Astravets near Hrodna. At 
          immigration he stated his ethnicity as Hungarian and changed his 
          surname from <i>Zholhus</i> (&#1046;&#1086;&#1083;&#1075;&#1091;&#1089;&#1100;, &#379;o&#322;gu&#347;) to Czolgosz.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">He was baptized in St. Albertus 
          Catholic Church. His family moved to Detroit when he was five years 
          old.</p>
          <p align="justify">He left his family farm in Warrensville, Ohio, at 
          the age of ten to work at the American Steel and Wire Company with two 
          of his brothers. After the workers of his factory went on strike, he 
          and his brothers were fired. Czolgosz then returned to the family farm 
          in Warrensville. At the age of sixteen, he was sent to work in a glass 
          factory in Natrona, Pennsylvania for two years before moving back home.</p>
			<p align="justify"><b>Interest in anarchism</b></p>
			<p align="justify">In 1898, after witnessing a series of similar 
            strikes (many ending in violence), Czolgosz again returned home 
            where he was constantly at odds with his stepmother and with his 
            family's Roman Catholic beliefs. It was later recounted that through 
            his life he had never shown any interest in friendship or romantic 
            relationships, and was bullied throughout his childhood by peers. He 
            became a recluse and spent much of his time alone reading Socialist 
            and anarchist newspapers while drinking milk in his mother's attic. 
            He was impressed after hearing a speech by the political radical 
            Emma Goldman, whom he met for the first time during one of her 
            lectures in Cleveland in 1901. After the lecture Czolgosz approached 
            the speakers' platform and asked for reading recommendations. A few 
            days later he visited her home in Chicago and introduced himself as
            <i>Nieman</i>, but Goldman was on her way to the train station. He 
            only had enough time to explain to her about his disappointment in 
            Cleveland's socialists, and for Goldman to introduce him to her 
            anarchist friends who were at the train station. She later wrote a 
            piece in defense of Czolgosz.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The radical <i>Free Society</i> 
          newspaper issued a warning pertaining to Czolgosz, reading:</font></p>
          <blockquote>

            confirmed themselves of his identity and were on the point of 
            exposing him. His demeanor is of the usual sort, pretending to be 
            greatly interested in the cause, asking for names or soliciting aid 
            for acts of contemplated violence. If this same individual makes his 
            appearance elsewhere the comrades are warned in advance, and can act

          </blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Czolgosz believed there was a great 
          injustice in American society, an inequality which allowed the wealthy 
          to enrich themselves by exploiting the poor. He concluded that the 
          reason for this was the structure of government itself. Then he 
          learned of a European crime which changed his life: On July 29, 1900, 
          King Umberto I of Italy had been shot dead by anarchist Gaetano Bresci. 
          Bresci told the press that he had decided to take matters into his own 
          hands for the sake of the common man.</p>
          <p align="justify">The assassination shocked and galvanized the 
          American anarchist movement, and Czolgosz is thought to have 
          consciously imitated Bresci. Joseph Petrosino's warnings were useless, 
          because McKinley ignored them.</p>

            Assassination of President McKinley</span></b></p>
			<p align="justify">On August 31, 1901, Czolgosz moved to Buffalo, 
            New York. There, he rented a room near the site of the Pan-American 
            Exposition.</p>
          <p align="justify">On September 6 he went to the exposition with a .32 
          caliber Iver-Johnson &quot;Safety Automatic&quot; revolver (serial #463344) he 
          claimed he had purchased on September 2 for $4.50. With the gun 
          wrapped in a handkerchief in his pocket, Czolgosz approached 
          McKinley's procession, the President having been standing in a 
          receiving line inside of the Temple of Music, greeting the public for 
          10 minutes. At 4:07 p.m. Czolgosz reached the front of the line. 
          McKinley extended his hand; Czolgosz slapped it aside and shot him in 
          the abdomen twice at point blank range.</p>
          <p align="justify">Members of the crowd immediately subdued Czolgosz, 
          before the 4th Brigade, National Guard Signal Corps and police 
          intervened, and beat him so severely it was initially thought he might 
          not live to stand trial. Czolgosz was then briefly held in a cell at 
          Buffalo's 13th Precinct house at 346 Austin Street until he was moved 
          to the city's police headquarters downtown.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><b><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Trial and 
            execution</font></span></b></p>
			<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Following the assassination, newly-elevated 
            President Theodore Roosevelt issued a pronouncement declaring: &quot;When 
            compared with the suppression of anarchy, every other question sinks 
            into insignificance.”</p>
          <p align="justify">On September 13, the day before McKinley succumbed 
          to his wounds, Czolgosz was transferred from the police headquarters, 
          since the headquarters were undergoing repairs, to the Erie County 
          Women's Penitentiary. On the 16th he was taken to the Erie County Jail 
          before being arraigned before County Judge Emery. After the 
          arraignment, he was transferred to Auburn State Prison.</p>
          <p align="justify">A grand jury indicted Czolgosz on September 16, who 
          spoke freely with his guards, yet refused all interaction with Robert 
          C. Titus and Lorin L. Lewis, the prominent judges-turned-attorneys 
          assigned to defend him, and with the expert psychiatrist sent to test 
          his sanity.</p>
          <p align="justify">The district attorney at trial was Thomas Penney, 
          assisted by a Mr. Haller, whose performance was described as &quot;flawless&quot;. 
          Although Czolgosz answered that he was pleading &quot;Guilty&quot;, the 
          presiding Judge Truman C. White overruled him and entered a &quot;Not 
          Guilty&quot; plea on his behalf.</p>
          <p align="justify">In the nine days from McKinley's death on September 
          14, to Czolgosz's trial on September 23, Czolgosz's lawyers were 
          unable to prepare a defense since Czolgosz refused to speak to either 
          one of them. As a result, Lorin Lewis argued at the trial that 
          Czolgosz could not be found guilty for the murder of the president 
          because he was insane at the time (similar to the defense that was 
          used in the Charles J. Guiteau trial back in 1881, after the shooting 
          of President James A. Garfield).</p>
          <p align="justify">On September 23 and 24 prosecution testimony was 
          presented, consisting of the doctors who treated McKinley and various 
          eyewitnesses to the shooting. Lewis did not call any defense witnesses. 
          Czolgosz himself refused to testify on his own defense, nor did he 
          ever speak at all in court. In his statement to the jury, Lewis noted 
          Czolgosz's refusal to talk to his lawyers or cooperate with them, 
          admitted his client's guilt, and said that &quot;the only question that can 
          be discussed or considered in this case is... whether that act was 
          that of a sane person. If it was, then the defendant is guilty of the 
          murder... If it was the act of an insane man, then he is not guilty of 
          murder but should be acquitted of that charge and would then be 
          confined in a lunatic asylum.&quot;</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The prosecutor laid great stress on 
          Czolgosz's anarchist affiliations and called upon the jury to heed the 
          popular demand for a quick trial and execution. Since the defense had 
          been unable to enter evidence that Czolgosz had been afflicted with 
          any kind of temporary insanity, there could only be one verdict. Even 
          if the jury believed the defense that Czolgosz was insane by claiming 
          that no sane man would have shot and killed the president in such a 
          public and blatant manner in which he knew he would be caught, there 
          was still the legal definition of insanity to be overcome. Under New 
          York law, Czolgosz was legally insane only if he was unable to 
          understand what he was doing.</p>
          <p align="justify">At Thomas Penney's request, White closed the trial 
          with instructions to the jury that supported the prosecution's 
          argument that (a): Czolgosz was not insane, and that (b): he knew 
          clearly what he was doing. After this, any chance that remained of 
          acquitting Czolgosz on the basis of insanity was gone, since the 
          defense offered no evidence that he couldn't understand the wrongness 
          of his crime.</p>
          <p align="justify">Czolgosz was convicted on September 24, 1901 after 
          the jury deliberated for only one hour. On September 26, the jury 
          recommended the death penalty. Upon returning to Auburn Prison, 
          Czolgosz asked the warden if this meant he would be transferred to 
          Sing Sing to be electrocuted, and seemed surprised to learn that 
          Auburn had its own electric chair.</p>
          <p align="justify">Czolgosz was electrocuted by three jolts, each of 
          1800 volts, in Auburn Prison on October 29, 1901. His brother, Waldek, 
          and his brother-in-law, Frank Bandowski, were in attendance. When 
          Waldek asked the Warden for his brother's body to be taken for proper 
          burial, he was informed that he &quot;would never be able to take it away&quot; 
          and that crowds of people would mob him.</p>
          <p align="justify">His last words were &quot;I killed the President because 
          he was the enemy of the good people&nbsp;– the good working people. I am 
          not sorry for my crime.&quot; As the prison guards strapped him into the 
          chair, however, he did say through clenched teeth, &quot;I am sorry I could 
          not see my father.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">Czolgosz was autopsied by John T. Gerin; his brain 
          was autopsied by Edward Anthony Spitzka. The body was buried on prison 
          grounds following the autopsy. Prison authorities originally planned 
          to inter the body with quicklime to hasten its decomposition, but they 
          became dissatisfied with this option after testing quicklime on a 
          sample of meat. After determining that they were not legally limited 
          to the use of quicklime for the process, sulfuric acid was poured into 
          Czolgosz's coffin so that his body would be completely disfigured. The 
          warden estimated the acid caused the body to disintegrate within 12 
          hours.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Czolgosz's letters and clothes were 
          burned, although in the case of letters the names of those who had 
          sent threatening or sympathetic correspondence were recorded for 
          future reference.</p>
          <p align="justify"><b>Legacy</b></p>
          <p align="justify">Emma Goldman was arrested on suspicion of being 
          involved in the assassination, but was released, due to insufficient 
          evidence. She later incurred a great deal of negative publicity when 
          she published &quot;The Tragedy at Buffalo&quot;. In the article, she compared 
          Czolgosz to Marcus Junius Brutus, the killer of Julius Caesar, and 
          called McKinley the &quot;president of the money kings and trust magnates.&quot; 
          Other anarchists and radicals were unwilling to support Goldman's 
          effort to aid Czolgosz, believing that he had harmed the movement.</p>
          <p align="justify">The scene of the crime, the Temple of Music, was 
          demolished in November 1901, along with the rest of the Exposition 
          grounds. A stone marker in the middle of Fordham Drive, a residential 
          street in Buffalo, marks the approximate spot where the shooting 
          occurred . Czolgosz's revolver is on display in the Pan-American 
          Exposition exhibit at the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society 
          in Buffalo. In 1921 Lloyd Vernon Briggs, Director of the Massachusetts 
          Department for Mental Hygiene, reviewed the Czolgosz case and the 
          cases of Clarence Richeson and Bertram G. Spencer. Contrary to views 
          almost universally expressed at the time of the assassination, Briggs 
          concluded that Czolgosz was &quot;a diseased man, a man who had been 
          suffering from some form of mental disease for years. He was not 
          medically responsible and in the light of present-day psychiatry and 
          of modern surgical procedure, there is a great question whether he was 
          even legally responsible for the death of our President.&quot;</font></p>

            McKinley, attending the Pan-American Exposition, was shot twice by 
            Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. McKinley initially appeared to be 
            recovering from his wounds, but took a turn for the worse six days 
            after the shooting and died on September 14, 1901. Theodore 
            Roosevelt succeeded McKinley as President. McKinley was the third of

            believing them to be security risks. Cortelyou suggested that

			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Czolgosz was 
            born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1873, the son of Polish immigrants. He 
            had once been a factory worker but had been unemployed for several 
            years and was living with his family in 1901. Czolgosz had become 
            interested in anarchism in the years preceding the McKinley murder. 
            In May 1901 he attended a speech given by famous anarchist Emma 
            Goldman, in Cleveland, Ohio. Czolgosz traveled to Goldman's home in 
            Chicago on July 12 and spoke briefly to Goldman before she left to 
            catch a train. Goldman was later arrested and briefly detained on 
            suspicion of involvement in McKinley's murder.</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">In his 
            September 7 statement Czolgosz said that he had read eight days 
            prior, in Chicago, that McKinley would be attending the Exposition. 
            He immediately took a train to Buffalo and rented a hotel room. 
            Czolgosz was at the fair on September 5 for President's Day and 
            heard McKinley's speech. He was tempted to shoot the President then 
            but did not because he could not get close enough. </font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt"><span lang="en-us">Instead, he 
            came back to the Exposition the next day. Goldman's speech from May 
            was still &quot;burning [him] up&quot;. He joined the line of people waiting 
            to shake the president's hand. Czolgosz wrapped up his hand with a 
            white handkerchief to hide the pistol he was carrying.</span>
            <span lang="en-us">Secret Serviceman George Foster later explained 
            his failure to observe Czolgosz's wrapped-up hand by saying that 
            Czolgosz was too closely bunched up to the man in front of him. 
            However, at the trial, Foster would also admit to not noticing 
            Czolgosz because he was paying close attention to James Parker, a 
            black man who was standing in line immediately behind the assassin.</span></font></p>

            been shaking hands for approximately ten minutes when Cortelyou left 
            his side to shut the doors. William J. Gomph, the exposition's 
            official organist, was softly playing Schumann's Träumerei on the

			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">At this moment, 
            4:07 p.m. Czolgosz advanced to face the President. McKinley reached 
            out to take Czolgosz's &quot;bandaged&quot; hand, but before he could shake it 
            Czolgosz pulled the trigger twice. James Benjamin &quot;Big Ben&quot; Parker, 
            a six-foot six inch Black waiter from Atlanta who was laid-off by 
            the exposition's Plaza Restaurant, standing immediately behind 
            Czolgosz, punched him in the face, knocked him to the ground, and 
            knocked the gun from Czolgosz's hand. Agent George Foster jumped 
            onto Czolgosz and shouted to fellow agent Albert Gallagher &quot;Al, get 
            the gun! Get the gun! Al, get the gun! Gallagher instead got 
            Czolgosz's handkerchief, which was on fire. Private Francis O'Brien 
            of McKinley's Army detail picked up the gun.</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">McKinley 
            remained standing while security dragged Czolgosz away. After 
            someone hit Czolgosz again, McKinley cried out &quot;Don't let them hurt 
            him!&quot; Eleven minutes after the shooting an ambulance arrived and 
            McKinley was taken to the hospital on the Exposition grounds. He had 
            been shot twice. One bullet deflected off his ribs, making only a 
            superficial wound. However, the second bullet hit McKinley in the 
            abdomen, passed completely through his stomach, hit his kidney, 
            damaged his pancreas, and lodged somewhere in the muscles of his 
            back.</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">The doctors, 
            unable to find the bullet, left it in his body and closed up the 
            wound. An experimental X-ray machine, which might have helped to 
            find the bullet, was on hand at the exhibition, but for reasons that 
            remain unclear it was not used. (In the following days Thomas Edison 
            would arrange for an X-ray machine to be delivered all the way from 
            his shop in New Jersey, but it was never used either). McKinley, 
            still unconscious from the ether used to sedate him, was taken to 
            John Milburn's home to recover.</font></span></p>

			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Czolgosz 
            confessed everything that night stating, &quot;I killed President 
            McKinley because I done my duty. I didn't believe one man should 
            have so much service and another man should have none.&quot; He provided 
            more detail the next day, insisting that he acted alone, although 
            his statement did not prevent Goldman's arrest a few days later.</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Contrary to 
            Czolgosz's assertion that he had killed the President, not only was 
            McKinley still alive, but he seemed to be recovering. On Saturday, 
            September 7th, McKinley was in good condition, relaxed and 
            conversational. His wife was allowed to see him, and he asked 
            Cortelyou, &quot;How did they like my speech?&quot; A bulletin sent from his 
            sickbed on September 8 said, &quot;The President passed a good night and 
            his condition this morning is quite encouraging. His mind is clear 
            and he is resting well. Wound dressed at 8:30 and found in a very 
            satisfactory condition.&quot;</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Most of 
            McKinley's cabinet came to Buffalo, as well as his old friend and 
            former campaign manager, Senator Mark Hanna. Vice President Theodore 
            Roosevelt was attending a luncheon event in Vermont on September 6 
            when word came that the President had been shot. Roosevelt and his 
            party left immediately for Buffalo, arriving the next day. </font>
            </span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">However, by 
            September 10, McKinley had improved to the point that Roosevelt's 
            presence no longer seemed necessary, and, for the sake of publicity, 
            the Vice President left Buffalo that day. He went to take a hiking 
            vacation in the Adirondack Mountains, where his wife and family were 
            already waiting. Similarly, Mark Hanna and the cabinet members left 
            Buffalo when the crisis seemed to have passed.</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">The President 
            continued to improve. A bulletin on September 9 stated, &quot;The 
            President's condition is becoming more and more satisfactory. 
            Untoward incidents are less likely to occur.&quot; On September 10 a 
            bulletin stated, &quot;The President's condition this morning is 
            eminently satisfactory to his physicians. If no complications arise 
            a rapid convalescence may be expected.&quot; McKinley continued to take 
            water orally and nutritive enemas. On September 11, the President 
            took beef juice orally, the first food he'd taken in the stomach 
            since the shooting. Bulletins said &quot;continues to gain&quot; and 
            &quot;condition continues favorably.&quot; On September 12, McKinley had his 
            first solid food, some toast and egg with coffee, but he &quot;did not 
            relish it and ate very little.&quot;</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Later on 
            September 12, the President's condition began to worsen. He reported 
            headache and nausea and his pulse rate increased, rapid but weak. 
            McKinley became sweaty and restless, although he remained conscious 
            and alert. A bulletin on the morning of September 13 said, &quot;The 
            President's condition is very serious, and gives rise to the gravest 
            apprehension.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">That day, 
            Friday, September 13, McKinley began rapidly deteriorating. Hanna 
            and the cabinet returned to the Milburn house. McKinley was given 
            adrenaline and oxygen in attempts to improve his weak pulse. His 
            condition worsening, McKinley told his doctors, “It is useless, 
            gentlemen, I think we ought to have prayer.” Later, as he faded, 
            McKinley whispered the words to the hymn, &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee.&quot; 
            A bulletin at 6:15 p.m. said, &quot;The President's physicians report 
            that his condition is most serious in spite of vigorous 
            stimulation....unless it can be relieved the end is only a question 
            of time.&quot;</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Senator Hanna, 
            grief stricken, said &quot;Mr. President, can't you hear me? William!

			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">On September 
            12, Theodore Roosevelt and his family arrived at their cabin on the 
            5,344-feet-high Mount Marcy. The next morning, a cold, foggy day, 
            Roosevelt left for a climb to the top of the mountain, accompanied 
            by a couple of his friends and a park ranger. By noon on September 
            13, the Vice President and his party had stopped to rest at the 
            summit on a large flat rock that offered a panoramic view of the 
            mountains. They climbed back down five hundred feet to have lunch by 
            a lake. </font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">At about 1:30, 
            a park ranger arrived, running, bearing a telegram. Roosevelt 
            understood as soon as he saw the messenger what had happened, saying 
            later: &quot;I instinctively knew he had bad news....I wanted to become 
            President, but I did not want to become President that way.&quot;</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">The telegram 
            confirmed his fears, reporting that McKinley's condition had turned 
            very much for the worse. After returning to his cabin, Roosevelt 
            received a dire telegram from Secretary of War Elihu Root:</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">THE PRESIDENT 
            APPEARS TO BE DYING AND MEMBERS OF THE CABINET IN BUFFALO THINK YOU

			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Just before 
            midnight, Roosevelt left his family for a carriage ride down Mount 
            Marcy, a trip that even in daylight usually took seven hours. At 
            3:30 a.m. Roosevelt boarded another wagon and continued the long, 
            twisting ride down the mountain at high speed in the dark. Two hours 
            later, Roosevelt finally arrived at the train station in North 
            Creek, New York, where, at 5:22 a.m. on September 14, he received a 
            telegram from Secretary of State John Hay:</font></span></p>

			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Roosevelt then 
            boarded the train. The train stopped briefly in Albany before 
            pulling into Buffalo at 1:30 p.m. There he met his friend Ansley 
            Wilcox and went to Wilcox's house, one mile from Milburn's house 
            where McKinley's body lay. </font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">After cleaning 
            up, Roosevelt went to the Milburn house to pay his respects. He met 
            Root, Cortelyou, and most of the rest of the cabinet there, but 
            could not see McKinley's body as the autopsy was already underway. 
            Root recommended holding the ceremony there, but Roosevelt thought 
            that &quot;inappropriate&quot; and decided to return to the Wilcox house for 
            the swearing-in ceremony. Roosevelt took the oath of office as the 
            26th President of the United States at 3:30 p.m. Six weeks away from 
            his 43rd birthday, he was and still is the youngest man ever to hold 
            the office of President.</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><b><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Aftermath</font></span></b></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Emma Goldman 
            incurred a great deal of negative publicity when she published an 
            article in which she compared Czolgosz to Marcus Junius Brutus, the 
            killer of Julius Caesar, and called McKinley the &quot;president of the 
            money kings and trust magnates.&quot; Some other anarchists and radicals 
            were unwilling to help Goldman's effort to aid Czolgosz, believing 
            that he had harmed the movement.</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">Czolgosz went 
            on trial on September 23, 1901, only nine days after the President 
            died. Prosecution testimony took two days and consisted of the 
            doctors who treated McKinley and various eyewitnesses to the 
            shooting. Defense counsel Loran Lewis did not call any witnesses. In 
            his statement to the jury, Lewis noted Czolgosz's refusal to talk to 
            his lawyers or cooperate with them, admitted his client's guilt, and 
            said that &quot;the only question that can be discussed or considered in 
            this case is...whether that act was that of a sane person. If it 
            was, then the defendant is guilty of the murder....If it was the act 
            of an insane man, then he is not guilty of murder but should be 
            acquitted of that charge and would then be confined in a lunatic 
            asylum.&quot;</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">The jury took 
            only half an hour to convict Czolgosz. On September 26, Czolgosz was 
            sentenced to death. He was immediately taken to Auburn State Prison 
            to await execution. Czolgosz expressed remorse, saying, &quot;I wish the 
            people to know I am sorry for what I did. It was a mistake and it 
            was wrong. If I had it to do over again I never would do it. But it 
            is too late now to talk of that. I am sorry I killed the President.&quot; 
            Czolgosz was executed by means of electrocution on October 29, 1901.</font></span></p>
			<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><style="font-size: 8pt">After 
            McKinley's murder, Congress took up the question of Presidential 
            security. In the fall of 1901 they informally asked the Secret 
            Service to control presidential security, and the Service was 
            protecting President Theodore Roosevelt full-time by 1902. However, 
            this was not yet official. Some in Congress recommended the United 
            States Army be charged with protecting the President. Not until 1906 
            did the Congress pass legislation officially designating the Secret 
            Service as the agency in charge of presidential security.</font></span></p>

            Avenue, where McKinley died, was turned into an apartment building 
            in 1919 and later demolished around 1956, becoming part of the

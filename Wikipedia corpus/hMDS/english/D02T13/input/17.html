</UNRELATED_HEADLINES></td></tr></table><P>Buffalo, Sept. 6.--President McKinley, while holding a reception in the Temple of Music
at the Pan-American Exposition at 4 o'clock this afternoon, was shot and twice wounded 
by Leon Czolgosz, an Anarchist, who lives in Cleveland.
</P><P>
One bullet entered the President's breast, struck the breast bone, glanced and was later 
easily extracted. The other bullet entered the abdomen, penetrated the stomach, and has 
not been found, although the wounds have been closed.
</P><P>
The physicians in attendance upon the President at 10:40 o'clock to-night issued the 
following bulletin:
</P><P>
&quot;The President is rallying satisfactorily and is resting comfortably. 10:15 P. M. 
temperature, 100.4 degrees; pulse, 124; respiration 24.
</P><P>
--P.M. Rixey, <BR/>
--M.B. Mann, <BR/>
--R.E. Parke, <BR/>
--H. Mynter, <BR/>
--Eugene Wanbin. <BR/>
</P><P>
Signed by George B. Cortelyou, Secretary to the President.&quot;</P>
<P>This condition was maintained until 1 o'clock A. M. when the physicians issued the 
following bulletin:
</P><P>
&quot;The President is free from pain and resting well. Temperature, 100.2; pulse, 120; 
respiration 24.&quot;
</P><P>
The assassin was immediately overpowered and taken to a police station on the 
Exposition grounds, but not before a number of the throng had tried to lynch him. Later 
he was taken to Police Headquarters.
</P><P>
The exact nature of the President's injuries is described in the following bulletin issued by 
Secretary Cortelyou for the physicians who were called:</P>
<P>&quot;The President was shot about 4 o'clock. One bullet struck him on the upper portion of 
the breast bone, glancing and not penetrating; the second bullet penetrated the abdomen 
five inches below the left nipple and one and one-half inches to the left of the median 
line. The abdomen was opened through the line of the bullet wound. It was found that 
the bullet had penetrated the stomach.</P>
<P>&quot;The opening in the front wall of the stomach was carefully closed with silk sutures; after 
which a search was made for a hole in the back wall of the stomach. This was found and 
also closed in the same way. The further course of the bullet could not be discovered, 
although careful search was made. The abdominal wound was closed without drainage. 
No injury to the intestines or other abdominal organs was discovered. </P>
<P>&quot;The patient stood the operation well, pulse of good quality, rate of 130, and his 
condition at the conclusion of operation was gratifying. The result cannot be foretold. 
His condition at present justifies hope of recovery.&quot;
</P><P>
Leon Czolgosz, the assassin, has signed a confession, covering six pages of foolscap in 
which he states that he is an Anarchist and that he became an enthusiastic member of that 
body through the influence of Emma Goldman, whose writings he had read and whose 
lectures he had listened to. He denies having any confederate, and says he decided on the 
act three days ago and bought the revolver with which the act was committed in Buffalo.
</P><P>
He has seven brothers and sisters in Cleveland, and the Cleveland Directory has the 
names of about that number living in Hosmer Street and Ackland Avenue, which adjoin. 
Some of them are butchers and others are in other trades.</P>
<P>Czolgosz is now detained at Police Headquarters, pending the result of the President's 
injuries. He does not appear in the least degree uneasy or penitent for his action. He says 
he was induced by his attention to Emma Goldman's lectures and writings to decide that 
the present form of government in this country was all wrong, and he thought the best 
way to end it was by the killing of the President. He shows no signs of insanity, but is 
very reticent about much of his career.
</P><P>
While acknowledging himself an Anarchist, he does not state to what branch of the 
organization he belongs.

<B>How The Deed Was Done</B>
</P><P>
<B>Assassin Came with the Crowd to Greet the President and Shot When Two Feet from 
Him</B>
</P><P>
Buffalo, Sept. 6.--Czolgosz's attempt on the life of the President was made at about 4 
o'clock in the Temple of Music, where Mr. McKinley had gone to hold a reception at that 
hour. He had spent the day at Niagara with about 100 invited guests, and arrived at the 
exposition ground at 8:30. Mrs. McKinley proceeded to the Mission Building and the 
President went directly to the Temple of Music.
</P><P>
A vast crowd had assembled long before the arrival of Mr. McKinley. The daily organ 
recital was nearing its end as the President entered and went to the slightly raised dais at 
one end of the hall.
</P><P>
The President, though well guarded by United States Secret Service detectives, was fully 
exposed to such an attack as occurred. He stood at the edge of the raised dais, and 
throngs of people crowded in at the various entrances to see their Chief Executive, 
perchance to clasp his hand, and then fight their way out in the good-natured mob that 
every minute swelled and multiplied at the points of ingress and egress to the building.
</P><P>
The President was in a cheerful mood and was enjoying the hearty evidences of good-will 
which everywhere met his gaze. Upon his right stood John G. Milburn of Buffalo, 
President of the Pan-American Exposition, chatting with the President, and introducing to 
him persons of note who approached. Upon the President's left stood Mr. Cortelyou.
</P><P>
<B>The Assassin Appears</B>
</P><P>
It was shortly after 4 o'clock when one of the throng which surrounded the Presidential 
party, a medium-sized man of ordinary appearance and plainly dressed in black, 
approached as if to greet the President. Both Secretary Cortelyou and President Milburn 
noticed that the man's hand was swathed in a bandage or handkerchief. Reports of 
bystanders differ as to which hand. He worked his way with the stream of people up to 
the edge of the dais, until he was within two feet of the President.
</P><P>
President McKinley smiled, bowed, and extended his hand in that spirit of geniality the 
American people so well know, when suddenly the man raised his hand and two sharp 
reports of a revolver rang out loud and clear above the hum of voices and the shuffling of 
myriad feet. The assassin had fired through the handkerchief which concealed the 
revolver.
</P><P>
There was an instant of almost complete silence, like the hush that follows a clap of 
thunder. The President stood stock still, a look of hesitancy, almost of bewilderment, on 
his face. Then he retreated a step while a pallor began to steal over his features. The 
multitude seemed only partially aware that something serious had happened.
</P><P>
Then came a commotion. With the leap of a tiger three men threw themselves forward as 
with one impulse and sprang toward the would-be assassin. Two of them were United 
States Secret Service men, who were on the lookout and whose duty it was to guard 
against just such a calamity as had here befallen the President and the Nation. The third 
was a bystander, a negro, who had only an instant before grasped the hand of the 
President. In a twinkling, the assassin was borne to the ground, his weapon was wrested 
from his grasp, and strong arms pinioned him down.
</P><P>
Then the vast multitude which thronged the edifice began to come to a realizing sense of 
the awfulness of the scene of which they had been witnesses. A murmur arose, spread, 
and swelled to a hum of confusion, then grew to a babel of sounds, and later to a 
pandemonium of noises.
</P><P>
The crowds that a moment before had stood mute and motionless in bewildered 
ignorance of the enormity of the deed, now with a single impulse surged forward, while a 
hoarse cry welled up from a thousand throats, and a thousand men charged forward to lay 
hands upon the perpetrator of the dastardly crime.
</P><P>
<B>Confusion Reigns</B>
</P><P>
For a moment the confusion was terrible. The crowd surged forward regardless of 
consequences. Men shouted and fought, women screamed and children cried. Some of 
those nearest the doors fled from the edifice in fear of a stampede, while hundreds of 
others from the outside struggled blindly forward in the effort to enter the crowded 
building and solve the mystery of excitement and panic which every moment grew and 
swelled within the congested interior of the palatial edifice.
</P><P>
Inside on the slightly raised dais was enacted within those few feverish moments a 
tragedy, so dramatic in character, so thrilling in its intensity, that few who looked on will 
ever be able to give a succinct account of what really did transpire. Even the actors who 
were playing the principal roles came out of it with blanched faces, trembling limbs, and 
beating hearts, while their brains throbbed with a tumult of conflicting emotions which 
left behind only a chaotic jumble of impressions which could not be clarified into a lucid 
narrative of the events as they really transpired.
</P><P>
But of the multitude which witnessed or bore a part in the scene there was but one mind 
which seemed to retain its equilibrium, one hand which remained steady, one eye which 
gazed with unflinching calmness, and one voice which retained its even tenor and faltered 
not at the most critical juncture.
</P><P>
They were the mind and the hand and the eye and the voice of President McKinley.
</P><P>
After the first shock of the assassin's shots, he retreated a step, then, as the detectives 
leaped upon his assailant, he turned, walked steadily to a chair and seated himself, at the 
same time removing his hat and bowing his head in his hands.
</P><P>
In an instant Secretary Cortelyou and President Milburn were at his side. His waistcoat 
was hurriedly opened, the President meanwhile admonishing those about him to remain 
calm and telling them not to be alarmed.
</P><P>
&quot;But you are wounded,&quot; cried his secretary; &quot;let me examine.&quot;
</P><P>
&quot;No, I think not,&quot; answered the President. &quot;I am not badly hurt, I assure you.&quot;
</P><P>
Nevertheless his outer garments were hastily loosened, and when a trickling stream of 
crimson was seen to wind its way down his breast spreading its stain over the white 
surface of the linen their worst fears were confirmed.
</P><P>
A force of Exposition guards were on the scene by this time, and an effort was made to 
clear the building. The crush was terrific. Spectators crowded down the stairways from 
the galleries, the crowd on the floor surged forward toward the rostrum, while despite the 
strenuous efforts of police and guards the throng without struggled madly to obtain 
admission.
</P><P>
<B>In The Hospital</B>
</P><P>
The President's assailant in the meantime had been hustled to the rear of the building by 
Exposition Guards McCauley and James, where he was held while the building was 
cleared, and later turned over to Superintendent Bull of the Buffalo Police Department, 
who took the prisoner to No. 13 Police Station, and later to Police Headquarters.
</P><P>
As soon as the crowd in the Temple of Music had been dispersed sufficiently the 
President was removed in the automobile ambulance and taken to the Exposition 
Hospital, where an examination was made.
</P><P>
The best medical skill was summoned and within a brief period several of Buffalo's best-
known practitioners were at the patient's side. The President retained the full exercise of 
his facilities until placed on the operating table and subjected to an anesthetic.
</P><P>
Upon the first examination it was ascertained that one bullet had taken effect in the right 
breast just below the nipple, causing a comparatively harmless wound. The other took 
effect in the abdomen, about five inches below the left nipple, two inches to the left of the 
navel, and about on a level with it.
</P><P>
Upon arriving at the Exposition Hospital the second bullet was probed for. The walls of 
the abdomen were opened, but the ball was not located. The incision was hastily closed 
and after a hasty consultation it was decided to remove the patient to the home of 
President Milburn. This was done, the automobile-ambulance being used for the 
purpose.
</P><P>
Arrived at the Milburn residence, all persons outside the medical attendants, nurses, and 
the officials immediately concerned were excluded and the task of probing for the bullet, 
which had lodged in the abdomen, was begun by Dr. Boswell Park.
</P><P>
When it was decided to remove the President from the Exposition Hospital to the Milburn 
residence, the news was broken to Mrs. McKinley as gently as might be by the members 
of the Milburn family. She bore the shock remarkably well, and displayed the utmost 
fortitude.
</P><P>
<B>Crowd Ready to Lynch</B>
</P><P>
While the wounded President was being borne from the Exposition to the Milburn 
residence between rows of onlookers with bared heads, a far different spectacle was 
being witnessed along the route of his assailant's journey from the scene of his crime to 
Police Headquarters. The trip was made so quickly that the prisoner was safely landed 
within the wide portals of the police station and the doors closed before any one was 
aware of his presence.
</P><P>
The news of the attempted assassination had in the meanwhile been spread broadcast by 
the newspapers. Like wildfire it spread from mouth to mouth. Then bulletins began to 
appear on the boards along &quot;Newspaper Row,&quot; and when the announcement was made 
that the prisoner had been taken to Police Headquarters, only two blocks distant from the 
newspaper section, the crowds surged down toward the terrace, eager for a glimpse of the 
prisoner. At Police Headquarters they were met by a strong cordon of police, drawn up 
across the pavement on Pearl Street, who denied admittance to any but officials 
authorized to take part in the examination of the prisoner.
</P><P>
In a few minutes the crowd had grown from tens to hundreds, and these in turn quickly 
swelled to thousands, until the street was completely blocked by a surging mass of eager 
humanity. It was at this juncture that some one raised the cry of &quot;Lynch him!&quot; Like a 
flash the cry was taken up, and the whole crowd re-echoed the cry, &quot;Lynch him!&quot; &quot;Hang 
him!&quot; Closer the crowd surged forward.
</P><P>
Denser the throng became as new arrivals each moment swelled the swaying multitude. 
The situation was becoming critical when suddenly the big doors were flung open and a 
squad of reserves advanced with solid front, drove the crowd back from the curb, then 
across the street, and gradually succeeded in dispersing them from about the entrance to 
the station.
</P><P>
By this time there were probably 30,000 people assembled in the vicinity of Pearl, 
Seneca, Erie Streets, and the Terrace. The crowd was so great that it became necessary to 
rope off the entire street in front of Police Headquarters, and at a late hour to-night the 
police were still patrolling in the streets in the neighborhood, in squads of three or four. 
Inside the station house were assembled District Attorney Penny, Superintendent of 
Police Bull, Capt. Reagan of the First Precinct, and other officials.
</P><P>
The prisoner at first proved quite communicative, so much so in fact, that little 
dependence could be placed on what he said. He first gave his name as Fred Nieman, 
said his home was in Detroit, and that he had been in Buffalo about a week. He said he 
had been boarding at a place in Broadway. Later this place was located as John Nowak's 
saloon, a Raineslaw hotel, 1,078 Broadway. Here the prisoner occupied Room 8.
</P><P>
<B>The Prisoner's Story</B>
</P><P>
Nowak, the proprietor, said he knew very little about his guest. He came there, he 
declared, last Saturday, saying he had come to see the Pan-American and that his home 
was in Toledo. He had been alone at all times about Nowak's place, and had had no 
visitors. In his room was found a small traveling bag of cheap make. It contained an 
empty cartridge box and a few articles of clothing.
</P><P>
With these facts in hand the police went at the prisoner with renewed vigor in the effort 
to obtain either a full confession or a straight account of his identify and movements prior 
to his arrival in Buffalo. He at first admitted that he was an Anarchist in sympathy at 
least, but denied strenuously that the attempt on the life of the President was a result of a 
preconcerted plot on the part of any Anarchist society.
</P><P>
At times he was defiant and again indifferent. But at no time did he betray the remotest 
sign of remorse. He declared the deed was not premeditated, but in the same breath 
refused to say why he perpetrated it. When charged by District Attorney Penny with 
being the instrument of an organized band of conspirators, he protested vehemently that 
he never even thought of perpetrating the crime until this morning.
</P><P>
After long and persistent questioning it was announced at Police Headquarters that the 
prisoner had made a confession, which he signed.</P><p></p><br><font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to the top of this page.</a></font><br><a href="/web/20160401171616/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/index.html"><font size="2">Back to today's page.</font></a><br><a href="/web/20160401171616/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/archive.html"><font size="2">Go to another day.</font></a><br><a href="/web/20160401171616/http://www.umi.com/"><h5>Front Page Image Provided by UMI</h5></a></td></tr></table></td><td width="184" valign="top" align="center"><img src="/web/20160401171616im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/misc/spacer.gif" width="184" height="1" border="0" alt=""><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td width="104"><img src="/web/20160401171616im_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/misc/spacer.gif" border="0" width="104" height="1" alt=""></td><td width="468"><NYT_COPYRIGHT version="1.0" type="learning"><table width="468" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><hr size="1" width="468"></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"><A HREF="/web/20160401171616/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/copyright.html"><H5>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company</H5></A><A HREF="/web/20160401171616/http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/privacy.html#KidsPrivacy"><H5>Children's Privacy Notice</H5></A></td></tr></table></NYT_COPYRIGHT></td></tr></table>

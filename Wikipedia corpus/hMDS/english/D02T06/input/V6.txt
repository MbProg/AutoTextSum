At 5:55 p.m. on December 24, 1964, Viet Cong terrorists exploded a bomb in the garage area underneath the Brinks Hotel in Saigon, South Vietnam.
The hotel, housing 125 military and civilian guests, was being used as officers' billets for U.S. Armed Forces in the Republic of Vietnam.
Two Americans were killed, and 107 Americans, Vietnamese, and Australians were injured.
Small buildings at the rear of the Brinks Hotel were completely destroyed by the force of the blast

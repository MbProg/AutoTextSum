Fatalities on each of the North and South Vietnamese sides in the war are estimated at close to a million, including 58,303 U.S. military personnel. <sup>(1)</sup>  But everyday life also had to go on, and this page is devoted to pictures of Vietnamese street scenes where the only sign of war is the occasional military vehicle, usually a high-hood Jeep.<h2>Saigon</h2><p>South Vietnam's capital of Saigon was considered fairly safe from Viet Cong insurgents in the early 60's, but on Christmas Eve 1964 two Viet Cong operatives detonated a car bomb underneath the Brink Hotel, which was being used to billet junior American officers in the country in an advisory and support capacity. The explosion killed two Americans and injured approximately 60 people. That bombing, and the first penetration of the regular North Vietnamese Army into South Vietnam, were two events that made December 1964 a turning point in the war, and led to the arrival of U.S. combat troops.  <sup>(2)</sup> <p>The Brink Hotel, also known as Brink's BOQ (Bachelor Officers' Quarters) was repaired following the bombing, and American officers continued to stay there until the fall of Saigon in April 1975. <sup>(3)</sup> <p><a href="/web/20160316113708/http://cj3b.info/Photos/Military/Vietnam/Streets/SaigonRitzHotelGeorgeLane.jpg"><img src="/web/20160316113708im_/http://cj3b.info/Photos/Military/Vietnam/Streets/SaigonRitzHotelGeorgeLane600.jpg" alt="Ritz Hotel, Saigon" width="600" height="400" hspace="10" border="0" align="left"></a>This <a href="/web/20160316113708/http://cj3b.info/Photos/Military/Vietnam/Streets/SaigonRitzHotelGeorgeLane.jpg">detailed photo</a> (400K JPEG) was taken from the Brink's BOQ rooftop restaurant by George Lane in 1969. <sup>(4)</sup>  Probably many of the vehicles in the parking lot belong to Americans; mainly small European cars, although near the left side is what looks like a brand new 1969 white Impala.  <p>There are six Jeeps visible, including a MUTT and an M-38A1; chances are good that the rest are CJ-3B's, but it's hard to see for sure.

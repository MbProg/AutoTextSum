A Critical Study of the Fundamental Duties under the Constitution of India as Legally Enforceable Duties under Different Statutes
Constitution is the supreme law of India. It is the longest written constitution  of any sovereign country in the world, containing 448 articles in 25 parts, 12  schedules and 97 amendments. Besides the English version, there is an official  Hindi translation. B. R. Ambedkar is the Chief Architect of Indian Constitution . Constitution was enacted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949, and  came into effect on 26 January 1950. Date 26 January was chosen to commemorate  the Purna Swaraj declaration of independence of 1930.
It declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic,  assuring its citizens of justice, equality, and liberty, and endeavours to  promote fraternity among them. Constitution was formed on the 26th of November  in 1949 by the Constituent Assembly and came into force on the 26th of January  1950. Fundamental Duties of the citizens of India mentioned in Article 51A of  the Indian Constitution . By the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution , adopted in  1976, Fundamental Duties of the citizens have also been enumerated.
The Fundamental duties have been incorporated in the constitution to remind  every citizen that they should not only be conscious of their rights but also of  their duties. The concept of Fundamental Duties was taken from the constitution  of USSR along with the concept of Five Year Plan.
The Fundamental Rights in Part III, the Directive Principles of State Policy in  Part IV and the Fundamental Duties in Part IVA forms a compendium and have to be  read together. It is true that there is no legal sanction provided for violation  or non-performance of Fundamental Duties. There is neither specific provision  for enforceability nor any specific prohibition. However, Fundamental Duties  have an inherent element of compulsion regarding compliance. Out of the ten  clauses in article 51A, five are positive duties and the other five are negative  duties. Clauses (b), (d), (f), (h) and (j) require the citizens to perform these  Fundamental Duties actively. It is said that by their nature, it is not  practicable to enforce the Fundamental Duties and they must be left to the will  and aspiration of the citizens. However, in the case of citizens holding public  office, each and all Fundamental Duties can be enforced by suitable legislation  and departmental rules of conduct. Appropriate sanctions can be provided for  lapse in respect of each Fundamental Duty and it is quite practicable to enforce  the sanction against every citizen holding a public office; for instance,  departmental promotions can be deferred, increments can be withheld, etc. If an  officer takes part in a strike or stalls the proceedings of his institution, he  can be made to forgo the salary for that day.
For the proper enforcement of duties, it is necessary that it should be known to  all. This should be done by a systematic and intensive education of people that  is by publicity or by making it a part of education. The Law minister has  himself suggested it.
In M.C. Mehta (2) v. Union of India, the Supreme Court has held that under Art.  51-A (g) it is the duty of the Central Government to introduce compulsory  teaching of lessons at least for one hour in a week on protection and  improvement of natural environment in all the educational institution of the  country.
In AIIMS Students Union v. AIIMS, speaking about the importance of Fundamental  Duties enriched in Article 51-A while striking down the institutional  reservation of 33% in AIIMS coupled with 50% reservation discipline wise as  violative of Article 14 of the Constitution , the Supreme Court said that they  are equally important like fundamental rights.
2. Inception of the Indian Constitution
The Constitution of India came into force on 26 January 1950. Since then, the  day is celebrated as Republic Day. However, before 1950, 26 January was called  Independence Day. Since 26 January 1930, it was the day on which thousands of  people, in villages, in mohallas, in towns, in small and big groups would take  the independence pledge, committing them to the complete independence of India  from British rule. It was only fitting that the new republic should come into  being on that day, marking from its very inception the continuity between the  struggle for independence and the adoption of the Constitution that made India a  Republic.
The process of the evolution of the Constitution began many decades before 26  January 1950 and has continued unabated since. Its origins lie deeply embedded  in the struggle for independence from Britain and in the movements for  responsible and constitutional government in the princely states. Constitution is the supreme law of India. It is the longest written constitution of any  sovereign country in the world, containing 448 articles in 25 parts, 12  schedules and 97 amendments. Besides the English version, there is an official  Hindi translation. B. R. Ambedkar is the Chief Architect of Indian Constitution . Constitution was enacted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949, and  came into effect on 26 January 1950.[5]
It declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic,  assuring its citizens of justice, equality, and liberty, and endeavours to  promote fraternity among them. Constitution was formed on the 26th of November  in 1949 by the Constituent Assembly and came into force on the 26th of January  1950. Fundamental Duties of the citizens of India mentioned in Article 51A of  the Indian Constitution . By the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution , adopted in  1976, Fundamental Duties of the citizens have also been enumerated.
In 1946, the British decided to examine the possibility of granting independence  to India. As a result, a British cabinet mission was despatched to India to hold  discussions with the representatives of British India and the Indian States in  order to agree on the framework for writing a constitution, and, to set up a  constituent body and an executive council. Following this mission and the  ensuing negotiations, a Constituent Assembly was indirectly elected by the  provincial legislatures comprising 278 representatives and 15 women. Parties  represented in the CA were the Congress Party which had a majority, Muslim  League, Scheduled Caste Federation, the Indian Communist Party and the Union  Party. The CA met for the first time in December 1946 and by November 1949 the  draft constitution was approved. The constitution went into effect in January  1950 and the CA was transformed into a Provisional Parliament.
The Constitution which is still in force has been amended over 90 times making  it one of the most frequently amended constitutions in the world. It is also  known to be one of the longest and most detailed in the world with 395 articles  and 10 appendixes called schedules.

3. Fundamental Duties
Fundamental Duties of the citizens of India mentioned in Article 51A of the  Indian Constitution . By the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution , adopted in 1976,  Fundamental Duties of the citizens have also been enumerated.
Following are the Fundamental Duties under the Constitution of India which is  given in Part IV-A of the Constitution of India which was inserted by the (42nd  Amendment) Act, 1976.
It shall be the duty of every citizens of India-
a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the  National Flag and the National Anthem;
b) to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle  for freedom;
c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;
d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so;
e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the  people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional  diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women;
f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;
g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes,  rivers and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures;
h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and  reform;
i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence;
j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective  activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and  achievement.]
[(k) who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his  child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.]
The Fundamental duties have been incorporated in the constitution to remind  every citizen that they should not only be conscious of their rights but also of  their duties. The concept of Fundamental Duties was taken from the constitution  of USSR along with the concept of Five Year Plan.
Part IV-A of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, in accordance  with the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee in order to bring out Constitution in line with Article 29 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights, 1948 and the Constitution s of countries like Japan, China, U.S.S.R. etc.
Article 29 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human rights, 1948, states:
“Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full  development of his personality is possible.”
It is the basic principle of jurisprudence that every right has a correlative  duty and every duty has a correlative Right. But the rule is not absolute. It is  subject to certain exceptions in the sense that a person may have a right, but  there may not be a correlative duty.
In Chandra Bhawan Boarding v. State of Mysore, the Supreme court made the  following observation prior to the insertion of Article 51-A:
“It is a fallacy to think that our Constitution , there are only rights and no  duties. The provisions in Part IV enables the legislature to build a welfare  society and that object may be achieved to the extent the Directive Principles  are implemented by legislation.”
The Supreme Court has referred to these duties in the context of clause  (g)--pollution matters and Clause (j)--excellence in the civil service.
In A.I.I.M.S. Student’s Union v. A.I.I.M.S., a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme  Court made it clear that fundamental duties, though not enforceable by a writ of  the court, yet provide valuable guidance and aid to interpretation and  resolution of constitutional and legal issues. In case of doubt, peoples’ wish  as expressed through Article 51-A can serve as a guide not only for resolving  the issue but also for constructing or moulding the relief to be given by the  courts. The fundamental duties must be given their full meaning as expected by  the enactment of the Forty-second Amendment.
In Mohan Kumar Singhania v. Union of India, a governmental decision to give  utmost importance to the training programme of the indian Administrative Service  selectees was upheld by deriving support from Article 51-A (i) of the Constitution , holding that the governmental decision was in consonance with one  of the fundamental duties.
In Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra v. State of Uttar Pradesh, a complete  ban and closing of mining operation carried on in Mussoorie hills was held to be  sustainable by deriving support from the fundamental duty as enshrined in Article 51-A (g) of the Constitution . The court held that preservation of the  environment and keeping the ecological balance unaffected in a task which not  only government but also every citizen must undertake. It is a social obligation  of the state as well as of the individuals.
4. Enforceability of Fundamental Duties
The fundamental duties enjoined on citizen under Article 51-A should also guide  the legislative and executive actions of elected or non-elected institutions and  organisations of the citizens including the municipal bodies.
Duties are observed by individuals as a result of dictates of the social system  the environment in which one lives, under the influence of role models, or on  account of punitive provisions of law. It may be necessary to enact suitable  legislation wherever necessary to require obedience of obligations by the  citizens. If the existing laws are inadequate to enforce the needed discipline,  the legislative vacuum needs to be filled. If legislation and judicial  directions are available and still there are violations of duties by the  citizens, this would call for other strategies for making them operational.
The legal utility of fundamental duties is similar to that of the directives;  while the Directives are addressed to the state, so are the duties addressed to  the citizens, without any legal sanction for their violation. The citizen, it is  expected, should be his own monitor while exercising and enforcing his  Fundamental rights. He should keep in mind that he owes the duties specified in Article 51-A to the State and if he does not care for the duties, he does not  deserve the rights.
of course, the duties as such are not legally enforceable in the Courts of law,  but if a law has been made to prohibit any act or conduct in violation of the  duties, it would be reasonable restriction on the relevant Fundamental Rights.
However, the fundamental Duties are not enforceable by mandamus or any other  legal remedy
Directions to State/Central Government.—Since the Fundamental Duties are not  addressed to the State, a citizen cannot claim that he must be properly equipped  by the state so that he may perform his duties under Article 51-A. However, the  Supreme Court has issued directions to the States, having regard to Article 51-A  (g).
Protection of environmental—Duty of.—In view of the duty to protect and improve  the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild-life and to  have compassion for living creatures imposed on the citizens under Article 51-A  (g) of the Constitution , the Supreme Court has held that it is a duty of the  Central Government to take a number of steps in order to make this provision  effective, and issued the following directions to the Central Government—
a) To direct all educational institutions throughout India to give weekly  lessons in the first ten classes, relating to the protection and improvement of  the natural environment including forest, lake, rivers and wild life.
b) To get text books written for the said purpose and to distribute them free of  cost.
c) To introduce short term courses for training of teachers who teach this  subject.
d) Not only the Central Government but also the State Government and local  authorities are to introduce cleanliness weeks when all citizens including  member of Executive, the Legislature and the judiciary should render free  personal service to keep their local areas free from pollution of land, water  and air.
5. Conclusion
The Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties are sections of  the Constitution of India that prescribe the fundamental obligations of the  State to its citizens and the duties of the citizens to the State. The  Fundamental Duties are defined as the moral obligations of all citizens to help  promote a spirit of patriotism and to uphold the unity of India. These duties,  set out in Part IV–A of the Constitution concern individuals and the nation.  Citizens are morally obligated by the Constitution to perform these duties. The  Fundamental Duties are however, not legally enforceable, i.e. without any legal  sanction in case of their violation or non-compliance.
There is a need for these duties to be obligatory for all citizens, subject to  the State enforcing the same by means of a valid law, or else the law stands in  a very disadvantageous position. The Supreme Court has finally, issued  directions to the State in this regard, with a view towards making the  provisions effective and enabling a citizens to properly perform their duties  properly. This project was an attempt to check the enforceability of the  fundamental duties under the different statutes, which have been references to  the Indian Constitution .

                  <p>Ms Shobhaa De,  eminent writer and columnist, delivered a talk at Kalinga Institute of Social  Sciences (KISS) on 27th February 2010. The talk constitutes a part of sixty-day  Lecture Series under International Seminar on 'We and Our Tribes', organised by  KISS and inaugurated by Shri Kantilal Bhuria, Hon'ble Union Minister of Tribal  Affairs on 10th February 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>Touching upon the  subject, Ms De said that the tribal culture still in archaic mode in India.  While everyone is moving forward in today's rapidly modernising world, this has  failed to cast its influence on the tribal culture, she observed. However, it  is important to respect and preserve their culture, she stressed. Ms. De was  accompanied by her husband Mr. Dilip De on her visit to KISS, the largest  residential institute for tribals in Asia. This is her second time visit to  this institute.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>Showering lavish  praises on Dr. A. Samanta, Founder, KIIT &amp; KISS, she said that that only  ten more visionaries like Dr. Samanta are enough to ensure rapid development of  the country. KISS should transfer his vision all over the world, she stated,  while appreciating the achievements of KISS students in rugby, hockey, etc. The  optimism seen on the faces of KISS students reflects Dr. Samanta&rsquo;s dedication and  tireless efforts, she said, adding that it is a matter of privilege to be here. </p>
                <p>Expressing gratitude  to literary genius Ms. Shobhaa De and Mr. Dilip De for visiting KISS, Dr.  Samanta said that it is a golden moment to be in inspiring company of personalities  like them. </p></td>

                  A team of doctors from Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) of KIIT University have performed a rare total hip replacement surgery. Left hip joint of Bansidhar Jena (61), a resident of Kalyanpur village of Khurda District and employed as Section Officer in Bhubaneswar Regional Research Centre, was damaged after he met with a road accident.<br>
                  <br>
                  The patient was operated and a plate was placed at the affected part at S.C.B Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack in 1995. Doctors advised him to change this plate after three years. However, due to some problems the patient did not follow the advice. So his condition continued to deteriorate resulting in pain and suffering. He was disappointed even after treatment by several doctors of Hyderabad, including in Apollo. <br>
                  <br>
                Upon suggestions of his relatives, he was admitted at KIMS under the guidance of Dr. Basanta Kumar Behera. On 15th February, Dr. Behera and his team of doctors successfully performed a rare surgery and fixed a machine. Now his health condition is good and he can move. Mr. Bansidhar Jena and his family members thanked Dr. Behera and his surgical team. </td>

                  </strong><br>
                  KIIT  University has an incredible placement record from its inception. Almost all  the students get placed even before they complete their course in this  University. It is so because of its quality academics, industry exposure and  rigorous placement training by the experts from various industries. The  University has achieved excellent placement in all streams for its graduates  passing out in 2010. This is a repeat of performance from last many years  showing that KIIT students enjoy special preference of recruiters. </p>
                  <p>Nearly  1250 students will graduate from  B. Tech., MCA, MBA, MBA in Rural Management and Biotechnology courses of KIIT  University in 2010 May/June. It is  incredible that KIIT is set to place almost all its graduates comfortably and  gainfully through campus placement at a time when global recession has dampened  the job prospect across most campuses in India and globe. <br>
                      <br>
                    The technology streams have recorded  60% placement, with 253 students bagging offer letters from TCS alone.  Technology streams traditionally enjoy the best placement among all  streams of KIIT University. This time more than 20 companies, including TCS,  Infosys,&nbsp; HCL Technologies, Vedanta,  Grasim Cement, Adani Power, Tata Power, IOTL, Essar Group and ACC visited the  campus. The highest pay of Rs. 6.5 lac  p.a. was offered by Tata Steel, while the average salary was Rs. 4.2 lac p.a. <br>
  <br>
                    As many as 18 companies have so far visited the KIIT School of Management for  placement. These include HDFC Bank, SBI Life, OCL, Airtel, Aegon Religare,  Fenesta, Mother Dairy, Grasim Cement, Helix Technology, Mahindra Finance, Asian  Paints, BP Ergo and SREI Finance. <br>
  <br>
                    School of Biotechnology and School of Rural Management, two new schools founded  in 2007, surprised the academicians with the overwhelming response of companies  for its 2nd Batch of students. Despite  the fact that campus placement of Biotechnology graduates in the country does  not take place in a big way, the School of Biotechnology of KIIT University  attracted reputed names such as Excel Life Sciences, KPS Clinical  Services, JN Mitra and APTI Craft, to name a few.</p>
                  <p>Similarly,  companies visiting KIIT School of Rural  Management include GCMM (Amul), International Rice Research Institute  (Manila), Indian Oil Company (JV), Jaipur Rug Company, MIMI Finance and  Spandana. </p>
                  <p>KIIT&rsquo;s unique focus on overall development of its  students and brand building helped its students to beat recession, said Dr. A.  Samanta, Founder of KIIT Group of Institutions.<br>
                      <br>
                Even as the economy is emerging out of the recession, academicians have  expressed hope that students of KIIT will not have problem in getting placed  due to the excellent inputs and brand name of the institute. By end of March  more than 40 companies have confirmed their visit to the University for  placement. Rest of the students are expected to be placed within these two  months.</p></td>

                  <br>
                  Contributions and services of Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS) in the field of tribal empowerment without any Government aid has surprised the Central Government. This sentiment was expressed by Shri Kantilal Bhuria, Hon&rsquo;ble Minister for Tribal Affairs, Govt. of India, who returned back to Delhi after one-day visit to KISS on 10th February 2010. Taking a note of the worldwide reputation of this unique institution for tribals, Shri Bhuria lauded its activities terming it as an example to be emulated by all. <br>
                  <br>
                  Facilities and care provided to 10,000 tribal children are no way less than any public school, he observed, while expressing surprise that KISS has come to this level without any Government aid. On the contrary, various projects similar to KISS have not had much success despite huge Government expenditure on them, he noted. Stating that experiences of KISS are a source of learning for the Ministry, the Hon'ble Minister requested Dr. A. Samanta, Founder of KISS &amp; KIIT to help establish institutions on the patterns of KISS in every state of the country. Shri Bhuria assured all assistance to him in this direction. <br>
                  <br>
                  The Minister was surprised to learn from Dr. Samanta about generous financial provision for KISS and its excellent management, despite a loan burden of 250 crore on KIIT. Students are insulated from any adverse impact from this. He assured all possible help to the institution from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs for its further development. Prior to visiting KISS, Shri Bhuria had gathered detailed information on the institution. <br>
                  <br>
                &quot;It is a noble initiative by Dr. Samanta, a man who has spent his childhood in poverty&quot;, the minister remarked, terming it one of its kind in the world. KISS was established in 1993 in a rented house with 125 tribal students. At present it has 10000 students.</td>

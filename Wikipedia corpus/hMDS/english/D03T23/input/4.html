      <h3><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Introduction</b></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Part III of the Indian Constitution 
        guarantees &#147;fundamental rights&#148; to all citizens, and some of 
        these, like the right to life (art. 21) and the right to equality (art.14), 
        to all persons.  The fun­damental rights are enforceable in the High Courts 
        and the Supreme Court.  In writ petitions before these courts, a person 
        or a citizen can seek enforcement of  fundamental rights and redress for 
        their breach.  Judicial review of executive action as well as of legislation 
        and judicial and quasi-judicial orders is recognized as part of the &#147;basic 
        structure&#148; of the Constitution which cannot be taken away even by 
        an amendment to the Constitution.<sup><a href="#1b">1</a><a name="1t"></a></sup> 
        The Supreme Court has the final word on the interpretation of the Constitution, 
        and its orders, being law, are binding and enforceable by all authorities&#151;executive, 
        legislative and judicial.<sup><a href="#2b">2</a><a name="2t"></a></sup> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Directive Principles of 
        State Policy (DPSP) are contained in part IV, articles 36 to 50, of the 
        Indian Constitution.  Many of the provisions correspond to the provisions 
        of the ICESCR.  For instance, article 43 provides that the state shall 
        endeavor to secure, by suitable legislation or economic organization or 
        in any other way, to all workers, agricultural, industrial or otherwise, 
        work, a living wage, conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of 
        life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities, 
        and in particular the state shall endeavor to promote cottage industries 
        on an individual or cooperative basis in rural areas.  This corresponds 
        more or less to articles 11 and 15 of the ICESCR.  However, some of the 
        ICESCR rights, for instance, the right to health (art. 12), have been 
        interpreted by the Indian Supreme Court to form part of the right to life 
        under article 21 of the Constitution, thus making it directly enforceable 
        and justiciable.<sup><a href="#3b">3</a><a name="3t"></a></sup>  As a 
        party to the ICESCR, the Indian legis­lature has enacted laws giving effect 
        to some of its treaty obligations and these laws are in turn enforceable 
        in and by the courts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Article 37 of the Constitution 
        declares that the DPSP &#147;shall not be enforceable by any court, but 
        the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance 
        of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to apply these principles 
        in making laws.&#148;  It is not a mere coincidence that the apparent 
        distinction that is drawn by scholars between the ICCPR rights and ESC 
        rights holds good for the distinction that is drawn in the Indian con­text 
        between fundamental rights and DPSP.<sup><a href="#4b">4</a><a name="4t"></a></sup> 
        Thus the bar to justiciability of the DPSP is spelled out in some sense 
        in the Constitution itself.   </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">However, the Indian judiciary 
        has overcome this apparent limitation by a creative and inter­pretative 
        exercise.  In what context that happened and how is what is proposed to 
        be exam­ined in this case study.  After briefly tracing the development 
        of this interpretative exercise through case law in the first three decades 
        of the working of the Constitution, I propose to examine the response 
        of the judiciary in the context of justiciability and enforceability of 
        specific ESC rights.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Fundamental Rights versus 
        DPSP</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When the tussle for primacy 
        between fundamental rights and DPSP came up before the Supreme Court first, 
        the court said, &#147;The directive principles have to conform to and 
        run sub­sidiary to the chapter on fundamental rights.&#148;<sup><a href="#5b">5</a><a name="5t"></a></sup> 
        Later, in the Fundamental Rights Case (referred to above), the majority 
        opinions reflected the view that what is fundamental in the governance 
        of the country cannot be less significant than what is significant in 
        the life of the individual.  Another judge constituting the majority in 
        that case said: &#147;In building up a just social order it is sometimes 
        imperative that the fundamental rights should be subordinated to directive 
        prin­ciples.&#148;<sup><a href="#6b">6</a><a name="6t"></a></sup> This 
        view, that the fundamental rights and DPSP are complementary, &#147;neither 
        part being superior to the other,&#148; has held the field since.<sup><a href="#7b">7</a><a name="7t"></a></sup> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The DPSP have, through important 
        constitutional amendments, become the benchmark to insulate legislation 
        enacted to achieve social objectives, as enumerated in some of the DPSP, 
        from attacks of invalidation by courts.  This way, legislation for achieving 
        agrarian reforms, and specifically for achieving the objectives of articles 
        39(b) and (c) of the Constitution, has been immunized from challenge as 
        to its violation of the right to equality (art. 14) and freedoms of speech, 
        expression, etc. (art. 19).<sup><a href="#8b">8</a><a name="8t"></a></sup> 
        However, even here the court has retained its power of judicial review 
        to examine if, in fact, the legislation is intended to achieve the objective 
        of articles 39(b) and (c), and where the legislation is an amend­ment 
        to the Constitution, whether it violates the basic structure of the constitution.<sup><a href="#9b">9</a><a name="9t"></a></sup> 
        Likewise, courts have used DPSP to uphold the constitutional validity 
        of statutes that apparently impose restrictions on the fundamental rights 
        under article 19 (freedoms of speech, expression, asso­ciation, residence, 
        travel and to carry on a business, trade or profession), as long as they 
        are stated to achieve the objective of the DPSP.<sup><a href="#10b">10</a><a name="10t"></a></sup></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The DPSP are seen as aids 
        to interpret the Constitution, and more specifically to provide the basis, 
        scope and extent of the content of a fundamental right.  To quote again 
        from the  Fundamen­tal Rights case: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Fundamental rights have 
          themselves no fixed content; most of them are empty vessels into which 
          each generation must pour its content in the light of its experience.   
          Restrictions, abridgement, curtailment and even abrogation of these 
          rights in circum­stances not visualised by the constitution makers might 
          become necessary; their claim to supremacy or priority is liable to 
          be overborne at particular stages in the history of the nation by the 
          moral claims embodied in Part IV.<sup><a href="#11b">11</a><a name="11t"></a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Judicial Activism and Public 
        Interest Litigation</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The internal emergency that 
        was in force between 1975 and 1977 and its aftermath contrib­uted significantly 
        to the change in the judiciary&#146;s perception of its role in the working 
        of the Constitution.  The period of the emergency witnessed large-scale 
        violations of basic rights of life and liberty.  There were also blatant 
        violations of the right to freedom of speech and expression.  The end 
        of the emergency saw the emergence of a realignment of political forces.  
        Nevertheless, the popularly elected government was weak and in trying 
        to find its feet, it did not last very long.  It was already collapsing 
        by 1978/1979, which was when the judiciary initiated the public-interest 
        litigation (PIL) movement.  The development of the jurisprudence of ESC 
        rights is also inextricably linked to this significant development.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The lifting of the emergency 
        and the realignment of political forces had not resulted in any dramatic 
        change in the social imbalances or executive excesses that had by then 
        become en­demic.  The postemergency period then provided the right environment 
        for the judiciary to redeem itself as a protector and enforcer of the 
        rule of law.  Judges woke up to this need and PIL was the tool the judiciary 
        shaped to achieve this end.  PIL was entirely a judge-led and judge-dominated 
        movement.<sup><a href="#12b">12</a><a name="12t"></a></sup> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What made PIL unique was that 
        it acknowledged that a majority of the population, on account of their 
        social, economic and other disabilities, was unable to access the justice 
        sys­tem.  The insurmountable walls of procedure were dismantled and suddenly 
        the doors of the Supreme Court were open to people and issues that had 
        never reached there before.  By relaxing the rules of standing and procedure 
        to the point where even a postcard could be treated as a writ petition, 
        the judiciary ushered in a new phase of activism where litigants were 
        freed from the stranglehold of formal law and lawyering.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>The<i> Maneka Gandhi</i> 
        Case and Thereafter</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Simultaneously, the judiciary 
        took upon itself the task of infusing into the constitutional pro­visions 
        the spirit of social justice.  This it did in a series of cases of which 
        <i>Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India</i> was a landmark.<sup><a href="#13b">13</a></sup><a href="#13b"> </a><a name="13t"></a> 
        The case involved the refusal by the government to grant a passport to 
        the petitioner, which thus restrained her liberty to travel.  In answering 
        the question whether this denial could be sustained without a predecisional 
        hearing, the court proceeded to explain the scope and content of the right 
        to life and liberty.  In a departure from the earlier view,<sup><a href="#14b">14</a><a name="14t"></a></sup> 
        the court asserted the doctrine of substantive due process as integral 
        to the chapter on fundamental rights and emanating from a collective understanding 
        of the scheme underlying articles 14 (the right to equality), 19 (the 
        freedoms) and 21 (the right to life).  The power the court has to strike 
        down legislation was thus broadened to include critical examination of 
        the substantive due process element in statutes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Once the court took a broader 
        view of the scope and content of the fundamental right to life and liberty, 
        there was no looking back.  Article 21 was interpreted to include a bundle 
        of other incidental and integral rights, many of them in the nature of 
        ESC rights.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In<i> Francis Coralie Mullin</i> 
        the court declared:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#147;The right to life 
          includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes with 
          it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, 
          clothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and expressing 
          oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and comingling 
          with fellow human beings.  The magnitude and components of this right 
          would depend upon the extent of economic develop­ment of the country, 
          but it must, in any view of the matter, include the bare necessi­ties 
          of life and also the right to carry on such functions and activities 
          as constitute the bare minimum expression of the human self.&#148;<sup><a href="#15b">15</a><a name="15t"></a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The combined effect of the 
        expanded interpretation of the right to life and the use of PIL as a tool 
        led the court into areas where there was a crying need for social justice.  
        These were areas where there was a direct interaction between law and 
        poverty, as in the case of bonded labor and child labor, and crime and 
        poverty, as in the case of undertrials in jails.  In reading several of 
        these concomitant rights of dignity, living conditions, health into the 
        ambit of the right to life, the court overcame the difficulty of justiciability 
        of these as economic and social rights, which were hitherto, in their 
        manifestation as DPSP, considered nonenforceable.  A brief look at how 
        some of these ESC rights were dealt with by the court in four specific 
        contexts will help understand the development of the law in this area.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Right to Work </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Article 41 of the Constitution 
        provides that &#147;the State shall within the limits of its economic 
        capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right 
        to work, to educa­tion and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, 
        old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want.&#148;<sup><a href="#16b">16</a><a name="16t"></a></sup> 
        Article 38 states that the state shall strive to pro­mote the welfare 
        of the people and article 43 states it shall endeavor to secure a living 
        wage and a decent standard of life to all workers.  One of the contexts 
        in which the problem of enforceability of such a right was posed before 
        the Supreme Court was of large-scale aboli­tion of posts of village officers 
        in the State of Tamil Nadu in India.  In negating the conten­tion that 
        such an abolition of posts would fall foul of the DPSP, the court said:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is no doubt true that 
          Article 38 and Article 43 of the Constitution insist that the State 
          should endeavour to find sufficient work for the people so that they 
          may put their capacity to work into economic use and earn a fairly good 
          living.  But these articles do not mean that everybody should be provided 
          with a job in the civil service of the State and if a person is provided 
          with one he should not be asked to leave it even for a just cause.  
          If it were not so, there would be justification for a small per­centage 
          of the population being in Government service and in receipt of regular 
          income and a large majority of them remaining outside with no guaranteed 
          means of living.  It would certainly be an ideal state of affairs if 
          work could be found for all the able-bodied men and women and everybody 
          is guaranteed the right to participate in the production of national 
          wealth and to enjoy the fruits thereof.  But we are today far away from 
          that goal.  The question whether a person who ceases to be a government 
          servant according to law should be rehabilitated by being given an alternative 
          employment is, as the law stands today, a matter of policy on which 
          the court has no voice.<sup><a href="#17b">17</a><a name="17t"></a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But the court has since then 
        felt freer to interfere even in areas which would have been con­sidered 
        to be in the domain of the policy of the executive.  Where the issue was 
        of regulariz­ing the services of a large number of casual (nonpermanent) 
        workers in the posts and tele­graphs department of the government, the 
        court has not hesitated to invoke the DPSP to direct such regularization.  
        The explanation was:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even though the above directive 
          principle may not be enforceable as such by virtue of Article 37 of 
          the Constitution of India, it may be relied upon by the petitioners 
          to show that in the instant case they have been subjected to hostile 
          discrimination.  It is urged that the State cannot deny at least the 
          minimum pay in the pay scales of regu­larly employed workmen even though 
          the Government may not be compelled to extend all the benefits enjoyed 
          by regularly recruited employees.  We are of the view that such denial 
          amounts to exploitation of labour.   The Government cannot take ad­vantage 
          of its dominant position, and compel any worker to work even as a casual 
          labourer on starvation wages.  It may be that the casual labourer has 
          agreed to work on such low wages.  That he has done because he has no 
          other choice.  It is poverty that has driven him to that state.  The 
          Government should be a model employer.  We are of the view that on the 
          facts and in the circumstances of this case the classifica­tion of employees 
          into regularly recruited employees and casual employees for the purpose 
          of paying less than the minimum pay payable to employees in the corre­sponding 
          regular cadres particularly in the lowest rungs of the department where 
          the pay scales are the lowest is not tenable . . . It is true that all 
          these rights cannot be extended simultaneously.  But they do indicate 
          the socialist goal.  The degree of achievement in this direction depends 
          upon the economic resources, willingness of the people to produce and 
          more than all the existence of industrial peace throughout the country.  
          Of those rights the question of security of work is of utmost importance.<sup><a href="#18b">18</a></sup><a name="18t"></a>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In <i>Bandhua Mukti Morcha

        a PIL by an NGO highlighted the deplorable condition of bonded laborers 
        in a quarry in Haryana, not very far from the Supreme Court.    A host 
        of protective and welfare-oriented labor legislation, including the Bonded 
        Labour (Abolition) Act and the Minimum Wages Act, were being observed 
        in the breach.  In giving extensive directions to the state government 
        to enable it to discharge its constitutional obligation towards the bonded 
        laborers, the court said:<sup><a href="#20b">20</a><a name="20t"></a></sup></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The right to live with human 
          dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive 
          Principles of State Policy and particularly clauses (e) and (f) of Article 
          39 and Article 41 and 42 and at the least, therefore, it must include 
          protection of the health and strength of workers, men and women, and 
          of the tender age of chil­dren against abuse, opportunities and facilities 
          for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom 
          and dignity, educational facilities, just and humane conditions of work 
          and maternity relief.  These are the minimum require­ments which must 
          exist in order to enable a person to live with human dignity and no 
          State has the right to take any action which will deprive a person of 
          the enjoyment of these basic essentials.  Since the Directive Principles 
          of State Policy contained in clauses (e) and (f) of Article 39, Articles 
          41 and 42 are not enforceable in a court of law, it may not be possible 
          to compel the State through the judicial process to make provision by 
          statutory enactment or executive fiat for ensuring these basic essentials 
          which go to make up a life of human dignity, but where legislation is 
          already enacted by the State providing these basic requirements to the 
          workmen and thus investing their right to live with basic human dignity, 
          with concrete reality and content, the State can certainly be obligated 
          to ensure observance of such legislation, for inaction on the part of 
          the State in securing implementation of such legislation would amount 
          to denial of the right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article 
          21, more so in the context of Article 256 which provides that the executive 
          power of every State shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with 
          the laws made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that 
          State.<sup><a href="#21b">21</a><a name="21t"></a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus the court converted what 
        seemed a non-justiciable issue into a justiciable one by in­voking the 
        wide sweep of the enforceable article 21.  More recently, the court performed 
        a similar exercise when, in the context of articles 21 and 42, it evolved 
        legally binding guide­lines to deal with the problems of sexual harassment 
        of women at the work place.<sup><a href="#22b">22</a><a name="22t"></a></sup></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The right of workmen to be 
        heard at the stage of winding up of a company was a contentious issue.  
        In a bench of five judges that heard the case the judges that constituted 
        the majority that upheld the right were three.  The justification for 
        the right was traced to the newly inserted article 43-A, which asked the 
        state to take suitable steps to secure participation of workers in management.   
        The court observed: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is therefore idle to 
          contend 32 years after coming into force of the Constitution and particularly 
          after the introduction of article 43-A in the Constitution that the 
          workers should have no voice in the determination of the question whether 
          the enterprises should continue to run or be shut down under an order 
          of the court.   It would indeed be strange that the workers who have 
          contributed to the building of the enterprise as a centre of economic 
          power should have no right to be heard when it is sought to demolish 
          that centre of economic power.<sup><a href="#23b">23</a><a name="23t"></a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Right to Shelter</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Unlike certain other ESC rights, 
        the right to shelter, which forms part of the right to an ade­quate standard 
        of living under article 11 of the ICESCR, finds no corresponding expression 
        in the DPSP.  This right has been seen as forming part of article 21 itself.  
        The court has gone as far as to say, &#147;The right to life . . . would 
        take within its sweep the right to food . . . and a reasonable accommodation 
        to live in.&#148;<sup><a href="#24b">24</a><a name="24t"></a></sup> However, 
        given that these observations were not made in a petition by a homeless 
        person seeking shelter, it is doubtful that this declaration would be 
        in the nature of a positive right that could be said to be enforceable.  
        On the other hand, in certain other contexts with regard to housing for 
        the poor, the court has actually refused to recognize any such absolute 
        right.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In <i>Olga Tellis v. Bombay 
        Municipal Corporation</i>,<sup><a href="#25b">25</a><a name="25t"></a></sup> 
        the court held that the right to life included the right to livelihood.  
        The petitioners contended that since they would be deprived of their livelihood 
        if they were evicted from their slum and pavement dwellings, their evic­tion 
        would be tantamount to deprivation of their life and hence be unconstitutional.   
        The court, however, was not prepared to go that far.  It denied that contention, 
        saying:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">No one has the right to 
          make use of a public property for a private purpose without requisite 
          authorisation and, therefore, it is erroneous to contend that pavement 
          dwellers have the right to encroach upon pavements by constructing dwellings 
          thereon . . . If a person puts up a dwelling on the pavement, whatever 
          may be the economic compulsions behind such an act, his use of the pavement 
          would become unauthorised.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Later benches of the Supreme 
        Court have followed the <i>Olga Tellis</i> dictum with approval.  In <i>Municipal 
        Corporation of Delhi v. Gurnam Kaur</i>,<sup><a href="#26b">26</a><a name="26t"></a></sup> 
        the court held that the Municipal  Corpo­ration of Delhi had no legal 
        obligation to provide pavement squatters alternative shops for rehabilitation 
        as the squatters had no legal enforceable right.  In <i>Sodan Singh v. 
        NDMC</i><sup><a href="#27b">27</a><a name="27t"></a></sup> a constitution 
        bench of the Supreme Court reiterated that the question whether there 
        can at all be a fundamental right of a citizen to occupy a particular 
        place on the pavement where he can squat and engage in trade must be answered 
        in the negative.  These cases fail to account for socioeconomic compulsions 
        that give rise to pavement dwelling and restrict their examina­tion of 
        the problem from a purely statutory point of view rather than the human 
        rights perspective.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Fortunately, a different note 
        has been struck in a recent decision of the court.  In <i>Ahmedabad Municipal 
        Corporation v. Nawab Khan Gulab Khan</i>,<sup><a href="#28b">28</a><a name="28t"></a></sup> 
        in the context of eviction of encroach­ers in a busy locality of Ahmedabad 
        city, the court said:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Due to want of facilities 
          and opportunities, the right to residence and settlement is an illusion 
          to the rural and urban poor.  Articles 38, 39 and 46 mandate the State, 
          as its economic policy, to provide socio-economic justice to minimise 
          inequalities in income and in opportunities and status.  It positively 
          charges the State to distribute its largesse to the weaker sections 
          of the society envisaged in Article 46 to make socio-economic justice 
          a reality, meaningful and fruitful so as to make life worth living with 
          dignity of person and equality of status and to constantly improve excellence.  
          Though no person has a right to encroach and erect structures or otherwise 
          on foot­paths, pavements or public streets or any other place reserved 
          or earmarked for a public purpose, the State has the constitutional 
          duty to provide adequate facilities and opportunities by distributing 
          its wealth and resources for settlement of life and erection of shelter 
          over their heads to make the right to life meaningful.<sup><a href="#29b">29</a><a name="29t"></a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Right to Health</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The right to health has been 
        perhaps the least difficult area for the court in terms of justiciability, 
        but not in terms of enforceability.  Article 47 of DPSP provides for the 
        duty of the state to improve public health.  However, the court has always 
        recognized the right to health as being an inte­gral part of the right 
        to life.<sup><a href="#30b">30</a><a name="30t"></a> </sup>The principle 
        got tested in the case of an agricultural laborer whose condition, after 
        a fall from a running train, worsened considerably when as many as seven 
        government hospitals in Calcutta refused to admit him as they did not 
        have beds vacant.  The Supreme Court did not stop at declaring the right 
        to health to be a fundamental right and at enforcing that right of the 
        laborer by asking the Government of West Bengal to pay him compensation 
        for the loss suffered.  It directed the government to formulate a blue 
        print for primary health care with particular reference to treatment of 
        patients during an emergency.<sup><a href="#31b">31</a><a name="31t"></a></sup></font></p>

        Research Centre v. Union of India</i><sup><a href="#32b">32</a><a name="32t"></a></sup> 
        the court, in a PIL, tackled the problem of the health of workers in the 
        asbestos industry.  Noticing that long years of expo­sure to the harmful 
        chemical could result in debilitating asbestosis, the court mandated com­pulsory 
        health insurance for every worker as enforcement of the worker&#146;s 
        fundamental right to health.  It is again in PIL that the court has had 
        occasion to examine the quality of drugs and medicines being marketed 
        in the country and even ask that some of them be banned.<sup><a href="#33b">33</a><a name="33t"></a></sup></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A note of caution was struck 
        when government employees protested against the reduction of their entitlements 
        to medical care.  The court said:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">No State or country can 
          have unlimited resources to spend on any of its projects.  That is why 
          it only approves its projects to the extent it is feasible.  The same 
          holds good for providing medical facilities to its citizens including 
          its employees.  Provi­sion on facilities cannot be unlimited.  It has 
          to be to the extent finances permit.  If no scale or rate is fixed then 
          in case private clinics or hospitals increase their rate to exorbitant 
          scales, the State would be bound to reimburse the same.  The principle 
          of fixation of rate and scale under the new policy is justified and 
          cannot be held to be violative of article 21 or article 47 of the Constitution.<sup><a href="#34b">34</a><a name="34t"></a></sup>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Right to Education</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Article 45 of the DPSP, which 
        corresponds to article 13(1) of the ICESCR, states, &#147;The State shall 
        endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from the commencement 
        of this Con­stitution, for free and compulsory education for all children 
        until they complete the age of fourteen years.&#148;  Thus, while the 
        right of a child not to be employed in hazardous industries was, by virtue

        a period of ten years.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The question whether the right

        colleges, to state legislation regulating the charging of &#147;capitation&#148; 
        fees from students seeking admission.  The college management was seeking 
        enforcement of their right to business.  The court expressly denied this 
        claim and proceeded to examine the nature of the right to education.  
        The court refused to accept the nonenforceablity of the DPSP.  It asked: 
        </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is noteworthy that among 
          the several articles in Part IV, only Article 45 speaks of a time-limit; 
          no other article does.  Has it no significance?  Is it a mere pious 
          wish, even after 44 years of the Constitution?  Can the State flout 
          the said direction even after 44 years on the ground that the article 
          merely calls upon it to endeavour to pro­vide the same and on the further 
          ground that the said article is not enforceable by virtue of the declaration 
          in Article 37.  Does not the passage of 44 years&#151;more than four 
          times the period stipulated in Article 45&#151;convert the obligation 
          created by the article into an enforceable right?  In this context, 
          we feel constrained to say that allo­cation of available funds to different 
          sectors of education in India discloses an inver­sion of priorities 
          indicated by the Constitution.  The Constitution contemplated a crash 
          programme being undertaken by the State to achieve the goal set out 
          in Article 45.  It is relevant to notice that Article 45 does not speak 
          of the &#147;limits of its economic capacity and development&#148; as 
          does Article 41, which inter alia speaks of right to education.  What 
          has actually happened is more money is spent and more attention is directed 
          to higher education than to&#151;and at the cost of&#151;primary educa­tion.  
          (By primary education, we mean the education which a normal child receives 
          by the time he completes 14 years of age.)  Neglected more so are the 
          rural sectors, and the weaker sections of the society referred to in 
          Article 46.  We clarify, we are not seeking to lay down the priorities 
          for the Government&#151;we are only emphasising the constitutional policy 
          as disclosed by Articles 45, 46 and 41.  Surely the wisdom of these 
          constitutional provisions is beyond question.<sup> <a href="#37b">37</a><a name="37t"></a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The court then proceeded to 
        examine how this right would be enforceable and to what extent.  It clarified 
        the issue thus:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The right to education further 
          means that a citizen has a right to call upon the State to provide educational 
          facilities to him within the limits of its economic capacity and development.  
          By saying so, we are not transferring Article 41 from Part IV to Part 
          III&#151;we are merely relying upon Article 41 to illustrate the content 
          of the right to education flowing from Article 21.  We cannot believe 
          that any State would say that it need not provide education to its people 
          even within the limits of its economic capacity and development.  It 
          goes without saying that the limits of economic capac­ity are, ordinarily 
          speaking, matters within the subjective satisfaction of the State.<sup> 
          <a href="#38b">38</a><a name="38t"></a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">More caution followed.  The 
        court&#146;s apprehension clearly was that recognition of such a right 
        might open the flood gates for other claims.  It clarified:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We must hasten to add that 
          just because we have relied upon some of the directive principles to 
          locate the parameters of the right to education implicit in Article 
          21, it does not follow automatically that each and every obligation 
          referred to in Part IV gets automatically included within the purview 
          of Article 21.  We have held the right to education to be implicit in 
          the right to life because of its inherent fundamental importance.  As 
          a matter of fact, we have referred to Articles 41, 45 and 46 merely 
          to determine the parameters of the said right.<sup> <a href="#39b">39</a><a name="39t"></a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In fact, the court had broken 
        new ground in the matter of justiciability and enforceability of the DPSP.  
        The decision in <i>Unnikrishnan</i> has been applied by the court in formulating 
        broad parameters for compliance by the government in the matter of eradication 
        of child labor.  This it did in a PIL where it said:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Now, strictly speaking a 
          strong case exists to invoke the aid of Article 41 of the Con­stitution 
          regarding the right to work and to give meaning to what has been provided 
          in Article 47 relating to raising of standard of living of the population, 
          and Articles 39 (e) and (f) as to non-abuse of tender age of children 
          and giving opportunities and facilities to them to develop in a healthy 
          manner, for asking the State to see that an adult member of the family, 
          whose child is in employment in a factory or a mine or in other hazardous 
          work, gets a job anywhere, in lieu of the child.  This would also see 
          the fulfilment of the wish contained in Article 41 after about half 
          a century of its being in the paramount parchment, like primary education 
          desired by Article 45, having been given the status of fundamental right 
          by the decision in <i>Unnikrishnan</i>.  We are, however, not asking 
          the State at this stage to ensure alternative employment in every case 
          covered by Article 24, as Article 41 speaks about right to work &#147;within 
          the limits of the economic capacity and development of the State&#148;.  
          The very large number of child labour in the aforesaid occupations would 
          require giving of job to a very large number of adults, if we were to 
          ask the appropriate Government to assure alternative employment in every 
          case, which would strain the resources of the State, in case it would 
          not have been able to secure job for an adult in a private sector es­tablishment 
          or, for that matter, in a public sector organisation.  We are not issuing 
          any direction to do so presently.  Instead, we leave the matter to be 
          sorted out by the appropriate Government.  In those cases where it would 
          not be possible to provide job as above mentioned, the appropriate Government 
          would, as its contribution/grant, deposit in the aforesaid Fund a sum 
          of Rs.5000/- for each child employed in a factory or mine or in any 
          other hazardous employment.<sup><a href="#40b">40</a><a name="40t"></a></sup> 
          </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The court, while recognizing 
        the importance of declaring the child&#146;s negative right against exploitation 
        and positive right to education, chose a pragmatic approach when it came 
        to en­forceability.  Earlier the court would have shrugged off the whole 
        issue as not being within its domain.  That has now changed as is clear 
        from the recent trend of cases.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This much is clear from the 
        above narration&#151;that ESC rights are no less important than fun­damental 
        rights in the constitutional scheme.  They are enforceable when they are 
        projected as supplying the content of a fundamental right,<sup><a href="#41b">41</a><a name="41t"></a></sup> 
        but not just by themselves.<sup><a href="#42b">42</a><a name="42t"></a></sup></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The judiciary will not be 
        fettered by any apparent injunction in the Constitution against non-enforceability 
        of the DPSP.  It will, on the other hand, pin the state to its obligations 
        towards the citizens by referring to the DPSP.  Such obligation, the court 
        has explained in the context of right to environment, can confer corresponding 
        rights on the citizen:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It need hardly be added 
          that the duty cast on the State under Articles 47 and 48-A in particular 
          of Part IV of the Constitution is to be read as conferring a corresponding 
          right on the citizens and, therefore, the right under Article 21 at 
          least must be read to include the same within its ambit.  At this point 
          of time, the effect of the quality of the environment on the life of 
          the inhabitants is much too obvious to require any emphasis or elaboration.<sup><a href="#43b">43</a><a name="43t"></a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The ESC rights that the DPSP 
        symbolize can demonstrably be read as forming part of an enforceable regime 
        of fundamental rights.  What then is crucial is the will of the state 
        to im­plement this constitutional mandate.  The agenda of the state can 
        be shaped to a considerable extent by a creative and activist judiciary.  
        The state has to be constantly reminded of its ob­ligations and duties.  
        The actual realization of ESC rights may be a long-drawn affair, but keeping 
        it on the agenda is more than half that effort.  The Indian judiciary 
        has through a combination of strategies done just that.  That is the Indian 
        experience.</font></p>

      <p><strong>Relation Between Part III And Part IV Of <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/constitution/const_home.htm" title="Constitutional laws in India" target=_blank>Constitution</a> Of India-Changing  Trends</strong><br /> <br /> An individual to lead a life requires some rights. Rights have been described as  those claims of an individual that are necessary for the development of his  oneself and recognized by society or state. Some of rights that are recognized  by the state and enshrined in the constitution are called fundamental rights.  Fundamental rights are those rights of an individual that are enforceable  through courts of law.<br /> <br /> During the national struggle our leaders indicated that in the constitutional  set up in the constitutional set up in the free India people would be granted  certain rights. In fact in the various schemes relation to future constitutional  set up, there were references of particular rights that the people of India  should be granted. The common wealth of India bill (1925), the Nehru committee  report, the memorandum of the National trade Union Federation submitted to the  joint committee on Indian constitution reforms (1932&ndash;33), the memorandum  submitted by M. Venkatarangaiah to the Sapru committee and the Sapru committee  proposals provided for various fundamental rights that the people of free India  should get. The fundamental rights that are provided in the constitution can be  divided into six categories are as follows;<br /> <br /> 1. Right to Equality (<a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a>s 14 to)<br /> 2. Right to Freedom (<a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a>s 19-22)<br /> 3. Right against Exploitation (<a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a>s 23-24)<br /> 4. Right to Freedom of Religion (<a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a>s 25-28)<br /> 5. Cultural and Educational Rights (<a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a>s 29-30)<br /> 6. Rights to constitutional remedies.<br /> <br /> Directive principles of state policy are included in part IV of the Indian  constitution. Indian constitution is one among few constitution of the world  that has incorporated such provisions as a part of the main body of the  constitution. The constitution makers were inspired to include directive  principles of state policy in the constitution by the constitution of Ireland.<br /> <br /> One of main objectives of the constitution makers in including such a provision  in the constitution was to lay down certain principles for the guidance of the  governments. While formulating their policies the Governments are expected to  according to these principles.<br /> <br /> During the freedom struggle of India our national leaders had made promises  regarding the fundamental rights that the citizens of free India should get,  these fundamental rights included not only civil &amp; political rights but also  social &amp; economic rights. But when India got Independence the leaders realized  that it would not be possible for them to grant immediately some of the social &amp;  economic tights that they had promised in the past. But at the same time they  did not want to go back on hurdle. They assigned this task to a sub &ndash; committee  of the constituent assembly. The sub-committee suggested that the fundamental  rights should be divided into two categories. Some rights could be granted  immediately and others may be granted in future, if and when the country was in  position to grant them. This was the genesis of the two parts of the  constitution. Part three of the constitution deals with fundamental rights while  part IV relates to directives principles of state policy.<br /> <br /> The Fundamental Rights are defined as the basic human rights of all citizens.  These rights, defined in Part III of the <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/constitution/const_home.htm" title="Constitutional laws in India" target=_blank>Constitution</a>, apply irrespective of  race, place of birth, religion, caste, creed or gender. They are enforceable by  the courts, subject to specific restrictions.<br /> <br /> The Directive Principles of State Policy are guidelines for the framing of laws  by the government. These provisions, set out in Part IV of the <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/constitution/const_home.htm" title="Constitutional laws in India" target=_blank>Constitution</a>, are  not enforceable by the courts, but the principles on which they are based are  fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in  framing and passing laws.<br /> <br /> <strong>Purposes for insertion of Part III and IV in the constitution of India<br /> </strong>The framers of the Indian constitution were aware that there were other  constitutions which had given expression to certain ideals as the goal towards  which the country should strive and which had defined the principles considered  fundamental to the governance of the country. They were aware of the event that  had culminated in the charter of United Nations.<br /> <br /> Universal declaration of Human rights had been adopted by the General Assembly  of the United Nations, for India was a signatory to it. It contained a basic and  fundamental rights appertaining to all men. These rights were born of the  philosophical speculation of the Greek and Roman stoics and nurture by the  jurists of ancient Rome. These rights had found expression in a limited form in  the accords of 1188 entered into between King Alfonso IX and the cortes of leon,  the Magna Carta of 1215 and the guarantees which King Andrew II of Hungary was  forced to give by his Golden bull of 1822. The French National Assembly also  included the &ldquo;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&rdquo;. The first  ten amendments to the constitution of the United States of America contained  certain rights akin to Human rights. <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/constitution/const_home.htm" title="Constitutional laws in India" target=_blank>Constitution</a> of Eire, Japan also contained  similar rights and Directive principles. Section 8 of the article 1 of the U.S  constitution contained a Welfare clause empowering the federal Government to  enact laws for the overall general welfare of the people. U.S.A, the U.K and  Germany had passed social welfare legislation. The framers of the Indian  constitution, therefore, headed the constitution of India with a preamble which  declared India&rsquo;s goal and inserted parts III and IV in the constitution.<br /> <br /> <strong>Concept of Fundamental Rights- Their Origin &amp; Development<br /> </strong>Part III of the constitution of India, titled as &ldquo;fundamental right&rdquo; secures  to the people of India, certain basic, natural and inalienable rights. These  rights have been declared essential rights in order that &ldquo;human liberty may be  preserved, Human personality developed and an effective social and democratic  life promoted&rdquo;.<br /> <br /> Bhagwati. J in the case of Menaka Gandhi v/s Union of India held that these  fundamental rights represent and basic value cherished by the people of this  country since the Vedic times and they are calculated to protect the dignity of  the individual and create conditions in which every human being can develop his  personality to the fullest extent. They weave a &ldquo;pattern of guarantees on the  basic structure of human rights&rdquo;, and impose negative obligations on the state  not to encroach on individual liberty in its various dimensions.<br /> <br /> The aim behind having a declaration of fundamental rights is to make inviolable  certain elementary rights appertaining to the individual and to keep them  unaffected by the shifting majorities in the legislatures. It is to preserve  certain basic human rights against interference the state.<br /> <br /> Justice Jackson of the U.S. Supreme court in <span style="color: #ff0000;">West Virginia  State Board of Education v/s Barnet</span><br /> The very purpose of a bill of rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the  vicissitudes of political controversy to place them beyond the reach of  majorities and official and to establish them as legal principles to be applied  by the courts. One&rsquo;s right to life, liberty and property, to freedom of speech,  a free press, freedom of worship and assembly and other fundamental rights may  not be submitted to vote they depend on the outcome of no elections.<br /> <br /> The inclusion of a chapter on fundamental rights in the constitution is in  accord with the trend of modern democratic thought. These rights are basic to a  democratic polity. The object is not only, to ensure the inviolability of  certain essential rights against political vicissitudes, but also to impress  upon the people the fact of their having reached a new level of national  existence. The guarantee of certain basic human rights is an indispensable  requirement of a free society. The purpose is to preserve, for the benefit of  the people, their fundamental rights against infringement by the institutions  created by the constitution.<br /> <br /> The origin of the concept of fundamental rights may be traced to the 13th  century England. It was in 1215 that the people of England revolted against King  John at Ranneymade and enforced their demand for reiteration of their claims  against the Royal Absolutism. They, for the first time, seceded in extraction  assurances, from the King, for respect of their ancient liberties. The King was  made to acknowledge that there were certain rights of the subject which could  not be violated even by a sovereign in whom all power was legally vested. The  Magna Carta, 1215, which evidenced people&rsquo;s success, was a written document. It  enjoined &ldquo;respect for the law by the king; for bade denial of or delayed  justice; prohibited unlawful detention and excessive fines.<br /> <br /> In 1628, the petition of rights was presented to King Charles I, which was the  first step in the transfer of sovereignty from the King to parliament. It was  passed as the bill of rights, 1689, which dealt with rights and liberties of the  British people.<br /> <br /> In England the concept of &ldquo;Rule of Law&rdquo; forms the very bed-rock of British  constitution, &ldquo;Rule of Law&rdquo; explains that an individual in England has the right  and freedom to take whatever action he likes, so long as he does not violate any  rule of the ordinary law of the land. The rights of the individual are secured  by the ordinary law there. The proclamations of certain rights of the people,  made from time to time, in the form of charters such as Magna Carta 1215, and  the Bill of rights, 1689 are therefore, merely declaratory. These charters are  binding on the executive but impose no limitation on the power of parliament.  The protection of the rights and freedoms of the individual in England  therefore, rests not on constitutional guarantees, but on public opinion good  sense of the people, strong common law traditions and the sagacity of parliament  itself.<br /> <br /> The American adopted the constitution making for securing their bill of rights.  The original constitution framed in 1787 and brought into force in 1789, did not  contain any fundamental rights for Americans. It was met with serious  condemnation. Consequently, the first ten amendments were enacted in 1791,  incorporating the fundamental rights. These amendments have been described as  the American &ldquo;Bill of Rights&rdquo; the rights are binding on the executive as well as  the legislature. The courts of America therefore are competent to declare, an  act of the congress as unconstitutional, on the ground of violation of any  provision of their bill of rights.<br /> <br /> <span style="color: #006666;"><strong>Fundamental rights in India<br /> </strong></span>The framers of the Indian constitution followed the American model in  adopting and incorporating the fundaments rights for the people of India. The  constitution, not only secures the fundamental rights, but also, provides a  speedy and effective remedy for their enforcement.<br /> <br /> In the preamble to the constitution, wherein the people of India solemnly  resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic,  Republic and to secure to themselves justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.  They have been said to be the very foundation and the corner-stone of the  democratic way of life ushered in this country by the constitution. These rights  have been declared as sacrosanct, inalienable and inviolable. The minorities  regard these rights as the bedrock of their political existence, while the  majorities consider them as guarantee for their way of life. A significant  feature of the Indian Bill of Rights is that the remedy for the enforcement of  the fundamental rights is itself declared a fundamental right and is included in  the very chapter on fundamental rights. An act of the state whether legislative  or executive, if inconsistent with a fundamental rights is declared to be null  and void the nullity of such an act does not rest upon judicial pronouncement  but upon the express provision contained in <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a> 13.<br /> <br /> <span style="color: #006666;"><strong>Why guaranteed rights?<br /> </strong></span>The very purpose to withdraw certain subjects from the changing  pattern of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of a majority  in a legislature and officials in the government and to establish them as legal  principles to be applied by the courts. For, if the danger of personal rule by  despotic rulers has more or less disappeared as a result of representative  institutions coming into their own, that from legislative interference has  correspondingly increased because of the high handed manner in which majorities  might manage affairs in legislature. A dominant group of legislators could pass  any discriminatory or unjust legislation and prejudice the interests of  considerable section of the people. This meant in reality the substitution of  one kind of tyranny by another replacement of personal rule of the monarch by  the tyranny; of the legislative majority. One&rsquo;s right to life, liberty and  property, to free speech and free expression, freedom of worship and assembly  and other fundamental rights are not subjects to be submitted to vote. They  should not depend on the outcome of elections.<br /> <br /> When legislatures were prohibited form encroaching upon certain rights through  constitutional safeguards, the protection of these rights was achieved against  the arbitrary conduct of both the executive and the legislature. When and  independent judiciary was made the guardian of these rights was completely and  enjoyment of these rights by all irrespective of wealth or social status, race  or religious belief, was fully ensured. Herein lays the importance of  fundamental rights. The United States has led many countries in this respect.  Today, the idea of a list of a list of written rights as an integral part of new  constitution has been generally adopted. Even the British do not seriously  contest the wisdom of this arrangement and are prepared to concede is value at  least to a limited extent.<br /> <br /> <span style="color: #006666;"><strong>Directive principles of state policy<br /> </strong></span>Part IV article 36-51 of the India constitution says about directive  principles of state policy. It sets forth the ideals and objectives to be  achieved by the state for setting up in India a social welfare state, as  distinguished from a mere police state, which aims at social welfare state, as  distinguished from the common good and the secure to al its citizens, justice  socio and economic. The inspiration to include directive principles of state  policy is drawn from the constitution of Ireland. The basic aim of the welfare  state is the attainment of the substantial degree of social, economic and  political equalities the assumption by community acting through the state, as  its responsibility to provide the means, whereby all members can reach minimum  standard of economic security, civilized living capacity to secure social status  and culture to keep good health.<br /> <br /> <span style="color: #006666;"><strong>Object and purpose behind the directive principles<br /> </strong></span>The founding fathers were aware of the drawbacks; the country had  been suffering from such as poverty unemployment, lack of education, social,  economic, and political backwardness. They in order to eradicate these evils,  set forth in the very preamble, the ideals and objectives to be achieved. The  intention of the constitution framers was to establish in India a democracy  political, economic and social.<br /> <br /> To achieve this cherished goal, the framers were unanimous to secure to the  people practically all the prevailing political social and economic rights.  These rights were broadly speaking divided into two categories.<br /> <em>Political and Civil Rights<br /> Social and Economic Rights<br /> </em><br /> The political and Civil rights which were in opinion, with the reach of the  individual were provisional as fundamental rights and the latter being  considered beyond individual&rsquo;s reach under the prevailing circumstances, were  titled as Directive Principles of State Policy.<br /> <br /> <strong>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar while explaining the object underlying the Directive  principles of State Policy observed<br /> </strong>While we have established political democracy, it is also the desire that we  should law down as our ideal, economic democracy. We do not want merely to lay  down a mechanism to enable people to come and capture power. The constitution  also wishes to lay down an ideal before those who would be forming the  Government. That is ideal is economic democracy, whereby, so far as I am  concerned, I understand to mean one man one vote. By this it is clear that the  main object behind the Directive Principle sis to achieve the ideal of Economic  democracy.<br /> <br /> <span style="color: #006666;"><strong>Nature of Directive Principles<br /> </strong></span>In view of the non-enforceability, the directive principles have been  described by some critics as &ldquo;pious expressions&rdquo; or &ldquo;resolution made by the new  years day&rdquo;. To other they appear as an &ldquo;instrument of instructions&rdquo;. These  expressions however, betray the ignorance of the critics about the legal utility  of the Directives. Though they are non-enforceable, the directives are the  fundamental principles of governance and all the branches of government. The  executive, the legislature and the judiciary, have to take cognizance of them.  In fact, the judiciary has followed the principle of the harmonious construction  between the fundamental rights and the Directive principles of State policy.  Judiciary has also taken the help of the Directives while interpreting the  various provisions of the constitution. While dealing with relationship between  the fundamental rights and the directive principles, Chandrachud, chief Justice  of India then, stated in Minerva Mill&rsquo;s case, &ldquo;the Indian constitution is  founded on the bedrock of the balance between Parts III and IV to give absolute  primacy to one over the other is to disturb the harmony of the constitution.  This harmony and balance between fundamental rights and Directive principles is  an essential feature of the basic structure of the constitution.<br /> <br /> The executive has also resorted to them while justifying its (executive)  actions. For instance, in the case of Champakam Doriarajan v/s State of Madras,  while defending the communal order, of the Madras government, the plea was taken  that it was done to promote the interest of the weaker sections of the society  as per Directive Principle of the State Policy provided in <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a> 46 of the  constitution of India.<br /> <br /> The parliament also referred them while justifying its legislative measure. For  instance, in cases of Shankari Prasad and Golaknath, the government of India  pleaded before the Supreme Court while defending the constitution (First  Amendment Act, 1957) and the constitution (Fourth Amendment Act, 1955 respective  that they were enacted to five effects to the directive principles of the state  policy. Now directive principles of the state policy are related to political  policies, economic policies educational and cultural policies and health  policies.<br /> <br /> <span style="color: #006666;"><strong>Enforcement of Directive Principles &ndash; Role of Judiciary<br /> </strong></span>The Directive principles, as has been earlier seen, impose positive  delegation on the state. These directives are address to the state. The term  state has been defined by article 36 to have the same meaning as is given to  this term in part III of the constitution relating to the fundamental rights. It  thus means that the term State not only includes the legislature and the  executive organs of the government, but it also include its agencies and  instrumentalities.<br /> <br /> It follows that the directive principles can be implemented by executive action,  so long as these do not contravene any law. For the same reason, the local  authorities or the state instrumentalities shall have a moral obligation to  follow these directives and to act in consonance with these directives. Since  the term, state includes judiciary also; the courts or the statutory tribunals  would be equally under a duty to give effect to the directives.<br /> <br /> <span style="color: #006666;"><strong>Relation between part III and part IV of the Indian  constitution</strong></span><br /> The genesis and objectives underlying part III and part IV have common  desideratum in responding to the social consciousness rest with the constitution  making force. Which fundamental rights focus on interests of personality, the  Directives principles look on to the welfare of society. Judicial remedies for  fundamental rights and non justice able of directive principles are the  deliberate strategies of the constitution. The dichotomy between part III and  part IV and the supremacy of former over the latter a theory based on  formalistic and too textual an interpretation in Champakam Dorairajan did not  last for long time.<br /> <br /> A government order of the Madras government divided seats in colleges on the  basis of religion and caste. This was repugnant to article 29(2). But it was  argued that the government order could be supported on the basis of article 46  of the constitution which makes the state responsible for promoting the  education interests of the weaker sections of people. The Supreme Court held  that the fundamental rights under <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a> 29(2) over the Directive principle  under article 46. So the government order was struck down. It was held that in  case of any conflict between part III and part IV, the part III would prevail.  These observations of the court were based on the literal interpretation of the  provision of article 37 which declares the directive principle not justifiable.<br /> <br /> A remarkable change had come over in the judicial attitude on the question of  inter relationship.<br /> <br /> In<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Inre Kerala Education bill</span><br /> The Supreme Court observed &ldquo;though the directive principles can not override the  fundamental rights, nevertheless, in determining the scope and ambit of  fundamental rights the court could not entirely ignore the directive principle  but should adopt the principle of harmonious construction and should attempt to  give effect to both as much as possible.<br /> <br /> The Supreme Court began to assert that there is &ldquo;no conflict on the whole&rdquo;  between the fundamental rights and the directive principles. They are  complementary and supplementary to each other.<br /> <br /> In <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chandrabhavan and Kesavananda Bharati</span> cases  inaugurated a new era of integrationist approach which could emphasis the under  pinning of interrelated value of part III and part IV, Kesavananda Bharati&rsquo;s  case stood for penetration of the notion of distributive justice under <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a>  39(b) and (c) into the property relations by upholding the constitutionality of  <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a> 31c. the legislative contributions through agrarian and economic  reforms, labor welfare and other social justice statutes have by focusing on  social welfare, ultimately enhanced the worth of fundamental rights. Judicial  review, by removing unreasonable provisions monitored this process. In practice,  the interconnections of rights are more sensitized when the government takes the  directive principles of state policy seriously.<br /> <br /> In <span style="color: #ff0000;">Minerva Mills Limited v/s Union of India</span><br /> The court observed that the constitution was founded on the bed-rock of balance  between part III and part IV. To give absolute primacy to one over the other was  to disturb the harmony of the constitution. This harmony and balance between  fundamental rights and the directive principles is an essential feature of the  basic structure of the constitution. Both the fundamental and directive  principles of the state policy are embodying the philosophy of our constitution,  the philosophy of justice social economic and political. They are the two wheels  of the chariot as an aid to make social and economic democracy a truism.<br /> <br /> In <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bandhua Mukti Morcha v/s Union of India</span><br /> The approach of sticking to strict legalism in the implementation of laws  enforcing directive principles, which in turn promote fundamental rights, has  increased the role of directive principles in the inter-relationship doctrine.<br /> <br /> The integrative approach towards fundamental rights and directive principles or  that the both should be interpreted and read together has now come to hold the  field. It has now become a judicial strategy to read fundamental rights along  with Directive principles with a view to define the scope and the ambit of the  former. Mostly, directive principles have been used to broaden and to give depth  to some fundamental rights and to imply some more rights therein for the people  over and what are expressly stated in the fundamental rights.<br /> <br /> By reading article 21 with the directive principles, the Supreme Court has  expanded the horizon of article 21 and derived there from different rights of  the citizen. Some of them are;<br /> <br /> Right to life includes the right to enjoy pollution free water, air and  environments. The court has derived this right by reading article 21 with  article 48A.<br /> Right to health has been recognized as fundamental rights of the workers under  article 21. <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a> 23 and 24 deal with right against exploitation. Those  articles reflect the principles of article 39c. the directive principles that  the tender age of children and not abused and the children are given  opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of  freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth are protected against  exploitation and against moral and material abandonment are supported by the  post Maneka jurisprudence of rights of children under article 21 and 24. In Asad  and Salal Hydro project cases, the Supreme Court applied article 24 along with  article 21 to prohibit child labor being influence by the above directive  principles.<br /> Right to education under article 21A is to be understood with reference to  directive principles contained in article 41 and 45.<br /> <br /> It is necessary to look into interrelationship between specific directive  principles and fundamental rights in active practice. The central theme of  directive principles is human development with distributive justice, aims at  upward movement of the entire social system by making more people better off  without making others worse off. The interrelationship between the two results  in greater freedom and autonomy to all people, reduction of disparity in access  to resources and opportunities and sustainability of environment. Although  directives principles is a policy, because of its importance to human rights  values, its elevation to principle has taken place through the  inter-relationship, at least in core areas.<br /> <br /> I. Directive Principles of state policy, which are related to distributive  justice, molded the property relations by influencing the inter-relationship  doctrine both directly strive for promoting justice, social, economic and  political, in the social order. According to article 39(b) and (c), the state  shall direct its policy towards equitable distribution of the material resources  of the community, and non-concentration of wealth and means of production to the  common detriment. <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a> 38(2) directs state to minimize inequalities in income  and status amongst individuals and groups of people residing in different areas  or engaged in different vocations. The protection of agrarian reform  legislations under <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a> 31(4) and (6) was a manifestation of achieving these  goals in property relations. The post Kameshwar Singh development of  incorporating articles 31A and 31B into the constitution was for promoting the  policy of distributive justice. This meant the philosophy underlying article 39b  and (c) in the sphere of property relations became established after the  incorporation of article 31c. This provision immunizes the laws providing for  implementation of Directive principles enshrined in <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a> 39(b) and (c) from  any challenges based on articles 14, 19 and 31.<br /> <br /> It was in 1971 that the first step was taken to provide supremacy for directive  principles in the form of article 31c which was added to the constitution by the  constitution twenty fifth amendments Act, 1971<br /> <br /> The effect of the insertion of articles 31c was to provide supremacy for  directive principles contained in articles and 39(c) over fundamental rights  contained in articles 14, 19 and 31. It enhanced the utility of directive  principles which had stood the testimony of the Supreme Court in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kesavananda Bharti v/s State of Kerala</span><br /> <br /> The Court observed: In building up a just and social order it is sometimes  imperative that the fundamental rights shared be subordinated to directive  principles, economic goals have no uncontestable claims for priority over  ideological ones on the ground that excellence comes only after existence. It is  only if men exist that there can be fundamental rights.<br /> <br /> To further widen the scope of the Directive principles, the constitution (42nd  Amendment) Act 1976, amended article 31c for providing supremacy for all the  directive principles. The effect of amendment was to give overriding effect to  directive principles and to make them immune from being declared as violative of  the rights guaranteed by articles 14, 19 &amp; 31.<br /> <br /> However, the change incorporated by 42nd Amendment was struck down by the  Supreme Court in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Minerva Mills Ltd v/s UOI</span><br /> <br /> The Court thus restored <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a> 31c to its original State as inserted by Twenty  fifth amendments, 1971.<br /> <br /> It thus follows that the Directive principles contained articles 39(b) and 39(c)  shall have supremacy on the fundamental rights contained in articles 14 &amp; 19.<br /> II. The inter-relationship doctrine is very much influenced by article 39A  providing for equal justice and free legal aid the justice delivery system.  According to article 39A. The state shall secure that the operation of the legal  system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity and shall in particular  provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way  to ensure that opportunities for securing or other disabilities. The role of  this provision was pivotal in removing the impediment of poverty in one&rsquo;s access  to grievance redressed system<br /> <br /> In <span style="color: #ff0000;">M.H Hoskot Hussainara Khatoon</span> in number of  public interest litigation cases, this provision was relied upon to bring the  principle of equality into effect in the system of access to justice.<br /> <br /> In <span style="color: #ff0000;">M.H. Hoskot</span> the court held that &ldquo;free legal  assistance at state cost is a fundamental right of person accused of an offence  which may involve jeopardy to his life or personally liberty and his fundamental  rights is implicit in the requirement of reasonable fair and just procedure  prescribed by article 21.<br /> <br /> III. The directive principles that the state shall strive to secure its citizens  right to an adequate means of livelihood and make effective provision for  securing rights to work article 41 provided a basis for the supreme court in  olga tellis to locate right to livelihood in right to life under article 21, at  least the circumstance of deprivation of that right. The post Maneka approach of  just a fair and reasonable procedure become a handy instrument in this regard  similarly various positive rights of life like right to food, health,  environment and education were evolved by emphasizing on the relevant directive  principles of state policy. It is important to note that the language of these  provisions hinted the limitation of the scope of the positive rights also. This  enabled a pragmatic approach with regard to positive rights.<br /> <br /> IV. The directive principle that &ldquo;tender age of children are not abused&rdquo; and  article 39(f) could give impetus to and also get supported by the post Maneka  jurisprudence of rights of children under articles 21 and 24. In Asiad  construction and Salal hydro project cases the Supreme Court applied <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a> 24  in collaboration with article 21 to prohibit child labor being partly influenced  by the above directive principles. In Lakshmikanth Pandey a case concerning  transnational adoption to conform to article 14, and 21 The PIL cases relating  to rights of children under custodial detention also reflect similar approach.<br /> <br /> V. The directive principles of &ldquo;Equal pay for equal work&rdquo; and &ldquo;participation of  workers in management&rdquo; were received through right to equality under article 14  into part III in Randhir Singh v/s UOI and national textile workers Union v/s  P.R. Ramakrishna cases, and in turn assisted freedom of occupation under article  19(1) or right to livelihood under <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a> 21. In consumer education and  research centre v/s UOI by reading article 21 with articles 39(c), 41, 43 and  48A K. Ramaswamy J held for the court, &ldquo;The health and strength of the worker is  an integral facet of right to life&rdquo;.<br /> <br /> VI. The directive principles relating to uniform civil code has to potentiality  of using the interrelationship doctrine for its implementation. Application of  articles 14, 19, 21 in examining the constitutionality rights or right to  maintenance has shown the permeability of these noble principles into personal  laws will be compelled to conform to these standards, and hence uniform of  constitutional spirit will persuade for uniform standards. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">John Vallmattam v/s UOI </span>where section 118 of Indian  success Act 1925 which discriminated between religious communities in the matter  of allowing death bed bequests was struck down as violative of articles 14, 15,  16 and 26. The Supreme Court emphasized the need to effectuate the policy of  uniform civil code.<br /> <br /> VII. <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/articles.html" title="law Articles" target=_blank>Article</a>s 46 of DPSP provides a guidance for affirmative actions under  articles 15(4) and 16(4) and a pointer for resonant the tension between formal  and substantive equality by laying emphasis on infusing of strength and ability  to compete, through education and training to the weaker sections.<br /> <br /> VIII. The directives principles that the state shall Endeavour to foster respect  for international law and treaty obligations articles 51 has a great  potentiality of absorbing the international principle relating to guarantee of  human rights , and thus influence the inter-relationship doctrine.<br /> <br /> In Air India statutory Corporation v/s United Labor Union, it has been held that  the directive principles in the constitution are forerunners of the UNO  convention on right to development as inalienable human rights and every person  and all people are entitled to participate in contribute to and enjoy economic,  social, cultural and political development in which all human rights,  fundamental freedoms would be fully realized. These principles are embedded as  integral part of the constitution in the directive principles. Therefore, the  directive principles now stand elevated to inalienable fundamental human rights.<br /> <br /> <strong>Distinction between fundamental rights and directive principles of state  policy</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /> The inter-relationship doctrine between fundamental rights and directive  principles of state policy is not only theoretical but also practical and  rewarding. Fundamental rights provide for political freedoms to the citizens by  protecting them against excessive state action while directive principles are to  securing social and economic freedom by appropriated action both are inspiration  of reform legislation. The fundamental rights should be interpreted in the light  of directive principles to observe the limits set by directive principles in the  scope of the fundamental rights. For example article 39, 39-A can be interpreted  with article 21 of the constitution and article 46 can be interpreted with  article 29 and 30 of the constitution.<br /> <br /> The judicial attitude has undergone transformation where courts are very active  to uphold the fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution thereby  interpreting the provisions of part-IV i.e. Directive Principles of State  Policy. Initially, the courts adopted a strict and literal legal position in  interpreting part-III with part-IV of the constitution which is reflected in  State of Madras V/S Champakam Dorairajan. It was held in case of conflict  between part-III and part &ndash;IV the fundamental rights will prevail. In the course  of time, change came over the judicial attitude as the apex court views the  interplay between part-III and part-IV in different manner from that of  Champakam Dorairajan&rsquo;s case and held that there is good deal of value for  directive principles of state policy from legal point of view and started to  have harmonize between the two parts of constitution. The author has made an  attempt to show core area of interaction part-III and Part-IV in the above  paragraphs of this article.In the recent decisions of the apex and high courts  there has been a changing trend by making a harmonious construction between  part-III and part-IV of the constitution making directive principles of state  policy justifiable and enforceable on par with fundamental rights of the  constitution.<br /> <br /> <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>About Me: </strong></span>&nbsp;I am Jagadish.A.T - Faculty  Of Law, Jss Law College, Kuvempunagar, Mysore<br /> ***************<br /> #&nbsp; <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_Rights,_Directive_Principles_and_Fundamental_Duties_of_India" target="_blank"> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_Rights,_Directive_Principles_and_Fundamental_Duties_of_India</a><br /> # AIR 1978 SC 597.<br /> # (1942) 319 US 624.<br /> # P.D.K.M Samithy V/S State of West Bengal AIR 1996 SC2426<br /> # CAD III 495-495<br /> # AIR 1951 SC 226; 1951 SCR 525<br /> # Granville Austin Indian constitution Cornerstone of Nation<br /> # AIR 1958 SC 956<br /> # Chandrabhuvan boarding and lodging v/s State of Mysore AIR 1970 SC 2042<br /> # AIR 1973 SC<br /> # AIR 1980 SC 1789.<br /> # AIR 1984 SC 802, (1984) 2 SCC 161.<br /> <br /> .# M.P Jain, Indian <a href="/web/20160412203157/http://www.legalserviceindia.com/constitution/const_home.htm" title="Constitutional laws in India" target=_blank>Constitution</a>al Law, Lexis Nexus Butterworths, Wadhwa Nagpur,  6h edition P1370<br /> # AIR 1978 SC597<br /> # Kameshwar Singh V/S State of Bihar AIR 1950 Pat 329.<br /> # AIR 1973 SC 1461<br /> <br /> # AIR 1980 SC 1789<br /> # M.H Hoskot v/s State of Maharashtra AIR 1978 SC 1548<br /> # Hussainara khatoon v/s state of Bihar AIR 1979 SC 1369<br /> <br /> # Olga tellis v.s Bombay Municipal corporation AIR 1986 SC 180<br /> # PUDR v/s UOI AIR 1982 SC 1473<br /> # M.R Balaji v/s State of Mysore AIR 1963 SC 649 at 664<br /> # AIR 1997 SC 645.</p>

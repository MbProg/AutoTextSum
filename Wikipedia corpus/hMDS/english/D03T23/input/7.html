  <strong>Introduction</strong>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">1                     There are many differences between India and Australia.  India is the world's largest constitutional democracy.
 Its population is approximately 1.13 billion people occupying a land area of nearly 3 million square kilometres.  Australians number
about 21.05 million people, occupying a land area of about 7.7 million square kilometres (including offshore islands).  Significant
aspects of the history, culture, demography and geography of each  mark two very different societies.  There are however many things
our two countries have in common. The differences are a challenge to those who would engage in dialogue about comparisons between
their constitutions and legal systems and particularly in relation to freedom of expression and the media.   The things we have in
common provide a framework for a fruitful exchange of views. </P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">2                     Approaches to freedom of expression of individuals and of the media may be affected by cultural traditions and
sensitivities.  They may also be affected by religious and ethnic perspectives which differ in their range, nature and intensity
between societies.  But the challenge posed by these differences is not insurmountable at the level of general principle.    India
has an express constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.   Australia has no such guarantee.  However, the High Court has implied
in Australia's <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> a freedom of communication on political matters.  Importantly both of our countries share, as part of their constitutional foundations,
the heritage of the common law derived from England although altered and adapted to local conditions over the years.  That heritage
imported principles of a constitutional character relating to the rule of law and, in Australia, affects the interpretation of statutes
in a way that is relevant to the preservation of a variety of freedoms, including freedom of expression.  </P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">3                     Whether the scope and limits of freedom of expression are raised in a constitutional or statutory context or
at common law balancing exercises are called for.  The protection of freedom of expression in many constitutional democracies raises
similar issues which require judges to make normative assessments of the boundaries between that freedom and reasonable limits in
a free and democratic society.  The assessments may differ from country to country and within countries from time to time according
to changing circumstances including the composition of constitutional courts.  </P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">4                     It is a great honour on the occasion of the 60<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of India's independence to  have the opportunity to engage in a dialogue about freedom of speech and the media with its
leading constitutional judges.  It is a freedom of great importance to both our countries and recognised globally, since the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, as a fundamental human freedom.  Like many of the freedoms so described, it found its way into
<a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt III</a> of the Indian <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> which was being drafted at the time that the Universal Declaration was made.  Before proceeding to the core of the topic it would
be helpful to look at a little of Australia's constitutional history and the content and nature of its <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.</P>
  <strong>A brief overview of Australian constitutional history</strong>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">5                     One Australian constitutional historian has written that European Australia began as a jail which covered half
the continent. <A title="" href="#_ftn1" name=_ftnref1>[1]</A>  When Britain lost its American colonies, New South Wales was designated, in 1786, as a place to which British convicts might be
transported.<A title="" href="#_ftn2" name=_ftnref2>[2]</A>  On 26 January 1788, Arthur Phillip took possession of the new colony in the name of the British Crown.  This was the same year in
which the American colonies were writing their <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.</P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">6                     New South Wales initially covered all of Australia east of the 135<SUP>th</SUP> meridian together with the adjacent islands.  In 1825 Tasmania was carved out of it as a distinct colony.  In January 1851 the colony
of Victoria was created from its southern portion.  In 1859 the northern portion became the colony of Queensland .  South Australia
came into existence as a province in 1834 by direct Imperial enactment.  Western Australia, which was never part of New South Wales,
was established as a colony by direct Imperial enactment in 1829.  By the end of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century each of the colonies was self-governing.  The legal legitimacy of their constitutions depended directly or indirectly upon
acts of the British Parliament.  They did not have legal personalities capable of recognition at international law.  A leading Australian
constitutional law academic, Professor Leslie Zines, summarised the operation of colonial rule in Australia in the late 19<SUP>th</SUP> century thus: </P>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="Quote">The colonial Parliaments and ministers were to be left to manage matters of purely local concern without interference from the Imperial
authorities.  Generally speaking in all such matters the governor was to act on the advice of his local ministers who in turn were
responsible to the colonial Parliament.  In all matters affecting foreign nations or other parts of the Empire the Imperial government
and Parliament were alone responsible.<A title="" href="#_ftn3" name=_ftnref3>[3]</A></p>

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">7                     A successful movement towards the formation of an Australian federation began in the last decade of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century.  It came from the colonists.  It was driven by their concerns about foreign affairs, immigration, defence, trade and commerce
and industrial relations.  There was also anxiety about the colonising activities of France and Germany in the area.  These concerns
could not be addressed by a system comprising six separate colonial governments.  Importantly the movement did not seek to rid Australia
of British hegemony.  There was no desire to assert against government generally, or the British Government in particular, rights
and freedoms for colonists.  The rights most intensely debated were those of the individual colonies as proposed States against the
proposed Federal Parliament.</P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">8                     Colonial representatives met on several occasions in the 1890s to discuss and formulate an Australian <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.  They adopted a draft in March 1898.  Referendums were held and ultimately a majority of people in a majority of the colonies approved
it.  A <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> Bill was submitted to the United Kingdom Parliament.  The Bill was passed and on 9 July 1900 received the Royal Assent.  A proclamation
establishing the Commonwealth of Australia was signed by Queen Victoria on 17 September 1900 to take effect from 1 January 1901.

<P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">10                  An Australian constitutional scholar, Professor Harrison-Moore, writing at the end of the first decade of federation,

to attract support today.  In a frequently quoted observation made in 1935, one of Australia's great jurists of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, a former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Owen Dixon, described it thus: </P>

    </blockquote>  </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" text-align:="TEXT-ALIGN:" justify="justify" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">Dixon 's characterisation had consequences for constitutional interpretation.  He regarded the organs of government as institutions

Is it still to be regarded as simply a statute deriving its legality from its British ancestry or does it now derive its authority
from popular assent?  A challenge to its characterisation as a British statute was made in the High Court by Murphy J in 1976 when

 The proper operation of the system of representative government requires the same freedoms between elections.  They are also necessary

It is widely accepted that Australia did
not become an independent nation in the full sense of that term upon the creation of the Commonwealth on 1 January 1901.  Rather
it came into existence and entered the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century as a self-governing colony of the United Kingdom.  Indeed the United Kingdom parliament had continued competence to legislate
for Australia.  Australia remained subject to paramount British legislation, if for no other reason, than the specific provisions
of the <I>Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865.</I>  Paradoxically the Imperial statute had been enacted to support the validity of colonial statutes which were being struck down by
the Supreme Court of South Australia as inconsistent with English law.  The paramountcy of statutes extending to the colonies was
a saving provision.<A title="" href="#_ftn10" name=_ftnref10>[10]</A> </P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">14                  Australia lacked executive independence in the conduct of its foreign relations at the time of federation.  These
were carried on through the British government.  Eventually executive independence in the conduct of foreign relations was recognised
for all Dominions at an Imperial conference held in 1926.  The resolutions passed at that conference were sufficient "&hellip; to
secure the independence of Dominion executives, in the conduct of both domestic and foreign affairs".<A title="" href="#_ftn11" name=_ftnref11>[11]</A></P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">15                  Legislative independence from Great Britain did not come to pass until the adoption by the Australian Parliament
in 1942, retrospective to 1939, of the Statute of Westminster 1931 (UK).  That was a British statute which gave effect to the wishes
of Dominions to lift the fetters on their legislative powers imposed by the <I>Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 </I>( UK ).  The statute also affirmed the powers of Dominion parliaments to make laws having extraterritorial effect.  It repealed the
<I>Colonial Laws Validity Act</I> in relation to Dominion laws.  Interestingly, that Act continued to apply to the States of Australia until 1986. </P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">16                  Even after the Statute of Westminster it remained theoretically possible for the United Kingdom parliament to
make laws affecting Australia.  The final severance of the legislative umbilical cord between Australia and the United Kingdom did
not occur until 1986 with the passage of the <I><a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aa1986114/" class="autolink_findacts">Australia</I> <I>Act 1986</a></I> (UK) by the United Kingdom parliament and the corresponding Australia Acts of the Commonwealth and the State parliaments.   It was
then also that the last vestige of judicial dependence disappeared.  For until 1986 a litigant in a State Supreme Court could seek
leave of that Court to appeal to the Privy Council in England.  Although such appeals were not permitted where they involved matters
arising under the <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> or involving its interpretation, there were, for many years, effectively two final appellate courts for Australia, the High Court
and the Privy Council. </P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">17                  The passage of the <I>Australia Acts</I> became important in the decision of the High Court in 1992 which first found an implied freedom of political communication in the

In <I>Australian Capital Television<A title="" href="#_ftn12" name=_ftnref12>[12]</A></I>, Mason CJ said that the <I><a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aa1986114/" class="autolink_findacts">Australia Act</a></I> "marked the end of the legal sovereignty of the Imperial parliament and recognised that ultimate sovereignty resided in the Australian
people".<A title="" href="#_ftn13" name=_ftnref13>[13]</A>  On the other hand Dawson J, in dissent, refused to find the implication and did so on the basis that the legal foundation of the
Australian <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> was the exercise of sovereign power by the Imperial parliament.

But the same might be said of any form of non-arbitrary
government. That proposition of political theory, in his view, did not affect the legal basis of the <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>. </P>

for the extent to which norms of international law and, in particular, fundamental human rights and freedoms recognised at international
law may affect constitutional interpretation.  In Australia, as in India, international treaties and conventions to which Australia
is a party do not have effect in domestic law unless given effect by statute.  They may be taken into account in the interpretation

and fundamental freedoms stated in it.  He cited in support of that proposition the Bangalore Principles on the Domestic Application

Each colony which became a State already had in place a court system.  Those court systems continued
after federation and continue today.  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is vested in the High Court of Australia, such other
Federal Courts as are created by the Parliament and such other courts (eg Courts of the States) as it invests with Federal jurisdiction.
 The High Court is the final appellate court for all Australian jurisdictions.

That original jurisdiction extends to all matters
in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s75.html" class="autolink_findacts">(s 75(v)).</a>  That provision allows any person affected by unlawful action on the part of an officer of the Commonwealth, including Ministers
of the Crown and Commonwealth authorities, to seek a remedy in the High Court.  It is a jurisdiction which cannot be removed by statute.
 It is an important element of the rule of law in Australia.  It has some similarity to Article 32 of the Indian <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> which guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for enforcement of the rights conferred by <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/index.html#p3" class="autolink_findacts">Pt III.</a>  It is a jurisdiction which is also conferred by statute upon the Federal Court so that the High Court is not overburdened with cases

These trace their legal ancestry back
to the pre-federation constitutions of the self-governing colonies.  Those Constitutions derived their legal force from Imperial

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">32                  There are two immediate comments to make about Article 19.  The first is that it applies only to citizens.  As
the Supreme Court of India said in 1959: </P>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="Quote">A non-citizen running a newspaper is not entitled to the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression and, therefore cannot
claim, as his fundamental right, the benefit of the liberty of the Press.<A title="" href="#_ftn18" name=_ftnref18>[18]</A>  </p>
    </blockquote>  </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" text-align:="TEXT-ALIGN:" justify="justify" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">The second point is that the Article makes no separate provision for freedom of the press.  In this respect it stands in contrast
with the First Amendment of the <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> of the United States which makes a distinct provision for press freedom.  When the question was debated in the Constituent Assembly,
which ultimately adopted the proposed Indian <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, Dr Ambedkar, equated "the press" with the individuals or citizens behind it.  He said: </p>
    
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="Quote">The press has no special rights which are not to be given or which are not to be exercised by the citizen in his individual capacity.
 The editor of a press or the manager are all citizens and therefore when they choose to write in newspapers, they are merely exercising
their right of expression and in my judgment therefore no special mention is necessary of the freedom of the press at all.<A title="" href="#_ftn19" name=_ftnref19>[19]</A></p>

the customs of the time were racist and discriminatory.  It is sufficient to say that there was probably a variety of reasons behind

    <strong>Australian debates about constitutional and statutory protection of human rights</strong>
    <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">43                  Debate about the desirability of both constitutional and statutory Bills of Rights has been going on in Australia
for at least 35 years.  Attempts to introduce statutory Bills of Rights as Commonwealth law were made in 1973 and 1985.  The 1973
Bill which included protection for "freedom of expression" was strongly opposed and was not enacted.  It lapsed in 1974 when parliament
was prorogued.  The 1985 Bill was passed by the Lower House but did not find a majority in the Senate.  </P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">44                  In 1985 the Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, established a Constitutional Commission.  That Commission recommended

section 124E specified a number of rights including "(c) freedom of expression".<A title="" href="#_ftn28" name=_ftnref28>[28]</A>  The Commission observed that the Australian <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a> does not place any direct limitation on parliamentary powers to make laws which limit freedom of expression.  Laws restricting freedom
of expression cover a wide range of subjects.  They include defamation, sedition, blasphemy, obscenity, indecency and offensive behaviour,
contempt of court and of parliaments, legislation restricting reporting of certain court proceedings, laws regulating advertising,
laws governing the importation of books, films, videos and so forth, laws regulating the exhibition of films and the sale of certain
types of publications, laws regulating broadcasting and use of postal services and official secrets legislation.<A title="" href="#_ftn29" name=_ftnref29>[29]</A></P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">45                  The Constitutional Commission emphasised the long standing recognition of the importance of freedom of expression
to the maintenance of a democratic system of government and the exercise of democratic rights.  A constitutional guarantee of freedom
of expression would provide a safeguard against the use, by temporary majorities, of powers of government to eliminate competition
from political rivals or place temporary minorities at a disadvantage in the market place of political ideas.  It would ensure that
channels for communication of information and ideas were not impeded and to remind governments that their policies and performances
are never immune from criticism.    </P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">46                  A constitutional alteration referendum was conducted in September 1988.   It had the character of a cautious pilot
program.  It was not comprehensive.  It proposed extensions of existing rights relating to religious freedom, compensation for the
acquisition of property and trial by jury.  It also proposed a one vote, one value, principle.  It was overwhelmingly defeated. 
The reasons for its defeat had to do with an associated proposal for four year parliamentary terms and a perception that somehow
the changes were going to enhance the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament to the disadvantage of the States.  No further attempt
has been made to incorporate guaranteed rights and freedoms into the Australian <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.  </P>

press, the Act declares in s 6 that "Only individuals have human rights".  So a corporation carrying on a media business does not
have a right of freedom of expression.  Of course individuals expressing opinions through the media have such rights and no doubt
laws adversely affecting the ability of corporate media to carry such expressions of opinion could be seen as interfering with those
rights.  </P>

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">52                  The topic of constitutional and statutory protection of human rights in Australia, including freedom of expression,
has frequently been a matter of controversy.  A prominent element of the arguments advanced against the introduction of such rights
protection in Australia is that it shifts power on important matters of social policy from elected politicians to unelected judges.
  There is no doubt that human rights and freedoms guaranteed in constitutions and statutes around the world are broadly expressed.
 The definition of their limits in particular cases by reference to public interest considerations necessarily requires normative
judgments which may be seen to have a legislative character.    </P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">53                  The phenomenon of judges interpreting broad legal language and making normative decisions in that interpretation
is not new.  Such concepts as "reasonableness", "good faith" and "unconscionable conduct" found in the common law and in many statutes
involve that kind of decision-making.  The particular sensitivity of judgments about the scope of human rights guarantees is their
impact on legislation.  If a right is constitutionally guaranteed, then legislation held by a court to be incompatible may be invalid.
 If the human right is guaranteed by a statute, then a subsequent inconsistent statute will not thereby be invalid.  But the Declaration
of Incompatibility mechanism for which the Australian Capital Territory and Victorian legislation provides, is intended to impact
on the parliamentary process by requiring the Attorney-General to present the Declaration to the parliament and respond to it.</P>

India.  All that could be said was that it was done by imperceptible stages and that sovereignty was acquired some time before 1873.<A title="" href="#_ftn38" name=_ftnref38>[38]</A>  There was support for the view, not least in a Privy Council decision in 1863 that the common law of England was introduced into
India by a Charter of George I in 1726 which established the First Courts of Judicature.<A title="" href="#_ftn39" name=_ftnref39>[39]</A> </p>

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">62                  The common law was, for a time, applied in India in parallel with Islamic and Hindu laws and customs and in parallel
court systems some courts deriving authority from the Crown and others from the East India Company.  The parallel court system was
integrated with the creation of High Courts in the 1860s.  Most of the common and customary law, excluding personal law, was codified.<A title="" href="#_ftn40" name=_ftnref40>[40]</A>  But the bulk of the codified laws set out principles of the common law with some modifications.

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">63                  The common law has been referred to in the High Court of Australia as "&hellip; the ultimate constitutional foundation

common law effected by the decision of the High Court in <I>Mabo v Queensland (No 2</I>)<A title="" href="#_ftn42" name=_ftnref42>[42]</A> which, as he put it, held that the long understood refusal in Australia to accommodate within the common law concepts of native title

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">65                  The exercise of legislative power in Australia, as in the United Kingdom and in India, takes place in the constitutional
setting of a "liberal democracy founded on the traditions and principles of the common law".<A title="" href="#_ftn45" name=_ftnref45>[45]</A>  The importance of those traditions and principles in Australia is reflected in the long established proposition that statute law
is to be interpreted  consistently with the common law where the words of the statute permit.  Historically this proposition derived
from judicial resistance to legislative incursions on judge-made law.  In a passage, which is still frequently cited, O'Connor J
in the 1908 decision <I>Potter v Minahan<A title="" href="#_ftn46" name=_ftnref46>[46]</A></I> cited the 4<SUP>th</SUP> edition of Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes: </P>

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">66                  The Courts of the United Kingdom have enunciated a "principle of legality" which appears to be a strong presumption
that broadly expressed official discretions are to be subject to fundamental human rights recognised by the common law.  Lord Hoffman's
explanation of that principle was:  </P>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="Quote">The principle of legality means that parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost.  Fundamental
rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words.  This is because there is too greater risk that the full implications
of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process.  In the absence of express language or necessary
implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic
rights of the individual.  In this way the courts of the United Kingdom , though acknowledging the sovereignty of parliament, applied
principles of constitutionality little different from those which existed in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly
limited by a constitutional document.<A title="" href="#_ftn47" name=_ftnref47>[47]</A></p>

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">67                  The principle of legality was said by Laws LJ in 2003 to protect what he called "rights of a constitutional character
recognised by the common law".   He said that the abrogation of a "constitutional" common law right by statute would require a demonstration
that the actual intention of the legislature as distinct from its imputed constructive or presumed intention was to effect the abrogation.
 This test could only be satisfied by express words or words so specific that the inference of an actual determination to effect
the result contended for was irresistible.  He suggested that this development of the common law which applied not only to constitutional
rights but to what he called "constitutional statutes", gave "most of the benefit of a written constitution in which fundamental
rights are accorded special respect" but preserved the sovereignty of the legislature and the flexibility of the uncodified British

rights and freedoms against legislative incursion.  While the observations of Lord Justice Laws were strongly stated, they seemed
to go no further than a strongly stated interpretive rule.  That rule may be less strongly stated in Australia, but can properly
be regarded as "constitutional" in character even if the rights and freedoms which it protects are not. </P>
  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">68                  The application of this principle in support of freedom of expression was seen at the level of constitutional

"bicentennial", "200 years", "Australia", "Sydney", "Melbourne", "Founding", "First Settlement" and others in conjunction with the
figures 1788, 1988 or 88.  Articles or goods bearing any of these combinations without the consent of the Authority would be forfeited
to the Commonwealth.  In their joint judgment striking down some aspects of these protections, Mason CJ, Deane J and Gaudron J (Wilson,
Dawson and Toohey JJ agreeing) said: </P>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="Quote">Here the framework of regulation &hellip; reaches far beyond the legitimate objects sought to be achieved and impinges on freedom
of expression by enabling the Authority to regulate the use of common expressions and by making unauthorized use a criminal offence.
 Although the statutory regime may be related to a constitutionally legitimate end, the provisions in question reach too far.  This
extraordinary intrusion into freedom of expression is not reasonably and appropriately adapted to achieve the ends that lie within
the limits of constitutional power.<A title="" href="#_ftn50" name=_ftnref50>[50]</A></p>

      <p class="Quote">Freedom of speech may sometimes be a casualty of a law of the Commonwealth made under a specific head of legislative power - eg, wartime
censorship - or of a law designed to protect the nation - eg, a law against seditious utterances - but freedom of speech can hardly

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">69                  The common law can of course only go so far.  It does not provide the support for freedom of expression that would
accord it the status of a "right".   It cannot withstand plainly inconsistent statute law.  Great controversy erupted when, a few
days after the High Court first recognised the implied constitutional freedom of political communication one of its members, Toohey
J, appeared to some to raise the possibility of court imposed limits on legislative power by reference to liberal democratic values.
 He observed that parliaments had increasingly become seen as de facto agents or facilitators of executive power rather than bulwarks
against it.  He asked whether a court could imply limits on legislative power "so as to protect core liberal-democratic values".
 He said, inter alia: </P>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="Quote">If such an approach to constitutional adjudication were adopted, the courts would over time articulate the content of the limits on

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">70                  The common law has always adhered to the proposition that "&hellip; everybody is free to do anything, subject
only to the provisions of the law".<A title="" href="#_ftn53" name=_ftnref53>[53]</A>   That may suggest that freedom is what is left over when the law is exhausted.  But the principle of legality in England and the
interpretive principle in Australia suggests it is more than that.  TRS Allan wrote in 1996: </P>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="Quote">&hellip; the English Courts no longer view individual liberty (if indeed strictly speaking they ever had) as solely residual.  Liberty
is not merely what remains when the meaning of statutes and the scope of executive powers have been settled by the court.  The traditional,
civil and political liberties, like liberty of the person and freedom of speech have independent and intrinsic weight; their importance
justifies an interpretation of both common law and statute which serves to protect them from unwise and ill-considered interference
or restriction.  The common law, then, has its own set of constitutional rights, even if these are not formally entrenched against
legislative repeal.<A title="" href="#_ftn54" name=_ftnref54>[54]</A></p>

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">71                  There has long been a particular recognition at common law that freedom of speech and the press serves the public
interest.  Blackstone said that freedom of the press is "essential to the nature of a free State ".<A title="" href="#_ftn55" name=_ftnref55>[55]</A>  Lord Coleridge in 1891 said that: </P>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>

  <p class="MsoNormal" text-align:="TEXT-ALIGN:" justify="justify" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">The freedom recognised by Blackstone did not extend to "freedom from censure for criminal matter when published".  And that recognised
by Lord Coleridge did not extend to "wrongful acts".  Those limitations begged the question of what could be treated as "criminal"
or "wrongful" in the hands of a legislature unconfined by constitutional limits on the power of the parliament. This was taken up
in trenchant criticism of the Blackstone doctrine in the United States in the context of discussion about the First Amendment.<A title="" href="#_ftn57" name=_ftnref57>[57]</A></p>

  <P class=NumberedList style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt">72                  Despite its limits and vulnerability to statutory change, the common law gives a high value to freedom of expression

in England that local authorities and other organs of government cannot sue for libel at common law.  There is no public interest

Their Honours pointed out that the constitutional
freedom does not confer rights on individuals.  It invalidates any statutory rule inconsistent with the freedom.  It also requires
that the rules of the common law conform with the <a href="/web/20160411134053/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/" class="autolink_findacts">Constitution</a>.  In the context of defamation law therefore it had been necessary to determine the extent to which, if at all, common law rules
concerning the traditional defence of qualified privilege were consistent with the constitutional freedom of communication.  <I>Lange</I> held that the law of defamation burdened the constitutional freedom and that the law of qualified privilege, traditionally understood,
did not qualify that burden in a way that was consistent with the freedom in respect of government and political matters published
to the general public.  Because the law of qualified privilege had not generally recognised an interest or duty to publish defamatory
matter to the general public, the common law imposed an unreasonable restraint upon the constitutional freedom.  That required the
development of the common law as set out in the judgment in <I>Lange</I>.  In extending the law of qualified privilege to protect publications concerning governmental and political matters to mass audiences,

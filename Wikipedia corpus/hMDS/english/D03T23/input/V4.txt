Justiciability          of ESC Rightsthe Indian Experience
Introduction
Part III of the Indian Constitution          guarantees fundamental rights to all citizens, and some of          these, like the right to life (art. 21) and the right to equality (art.14),          to all persons.
The fun­damental rights are enforceable in the High Courts          and the Supreme Court.
In writ petitions before these courts, a person          or a citizen can seek enforcement of  fundamental rights and redress for          their breach.
Judicial review of executive action as well as of legislation          and judicial and quasi-judicial orders is recognized as part of the basic          structure of the Constitution which cannot be taken away even by          an amendment to the Constitution.
1 The Supreme Court has the final word on the interpretation of the Constitution,          and its orders, being law, are binding and enforceable by all authoritiesexecutive,          legislative and judicial.
2
The Directive Principles of          State Policy (DPSP) are contained in part IV, articles 36 to 50, of the          Indian Constitution.
Many of the provisions correspond to the provisions          of the ICESCR.
For instance, article 43 provides that the state shall          endeavor to secure, by suitable legislation or economic organization or          in any other way, to all workers, agricultural, industrial or otherwise,          work, a living wage, conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of          life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities,          and in particular the state shall endeavor to promote cottage industries          on an individual or cooperative basis in rural areas.
This corresponds          more or less to articles 11 and 15 of the ICESCR.
However, some of the          ICESCR rights, for instance, the right to health (art. 12), have been          interpreted by the Indian Supreme Court to form part of the right to life          under article 21 of the Constitution, thus making it directly enforceable          and justiciable.
3   As a          party to the ICESCR, the Indian legis­lature has enacted laws giving effect          to some of its treaty obligations and these laws are in turn enforceable          in and by the courts.
Article 37 of the Constitution          declares that the DPSP shall not be enforceable by any court, but          the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance          of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to apply these principles          in making laws.
  It is not a mere coincidence that the apparent          distinction that is drawn by scholars between the ICCPR rights and ESC          rights holds good for the distinction that is drawn in the Indian con­text          between fundamental rights and DPSP.
4 Thus the bar to justiciability of the DPSP is spelled out in some sense          in the Constitution itself.
However, the Indian judiciary          has overcome this apparent limitation by a creative and inter­pretative          exercise.
In what context that happened and how is what is proposed to          be exam­ined in this case study.
After briefly tracing the development          of this interpretative exercise through case law in the first three decades          of the working of the Constitution, I propose to examine the response          of the judiciary in the context of justiciability and enforceability of          specific ESC rights.
Fundamental Rights versus          DPSP
When the tussle for primacy          between fundamental rights and DPSP came up before the Supreme Court first,          the court said, The directive principles have to conform to and          run sub­sidiary to the chapter on fundamental rights.
 5 Later, in the Fundamental Rights Case (referred to above), the majority          opinions reflected the view that what is fundamental in the governance          of the country cannot be less significant than what is significant in          the life of the individual.
Another judge constituting the majority in          that case said: In building up a just social order it is sometimes          imperative that the fundamental rights should be subordinated to directive          prin­ciples.
 6 This          view, that the fundamental rights and DPSP are complementary, neither          part being superior to the other, has held the field since.
7
The DPSP have, through important          constitutional amendments, become the benchmark to insulate legislation          enacted to achieve social objectives, as enumerated in some of the DPSP,          from attacks of invalidation by courts.
This way, legislation for achieving          agrarian reforms, and specifically for achieving the objectives of articles          39(b) and (c) of the Constitution, has been immunized from challenge as          to its violation of the right to equality (art. 14) and freedoms of speech,          expression, etc. (art. 19).
8 However, even here the court has retained its power of judicial review          to examine if, in fact, the legislation is intended to achieve the objective          of articles 39(b) and (c), and where the legislation is an amend­ment          to the Constitution, whether it violates the basic structure of the constitution.
9 Likewise, courts have used DPSP to uphold the constitutional validity          of statutes that apparently impose restrictions on the fundamental rights          under article 19 (freedoms of speech, expression, asso­ciation, residence,          travel and to carry on a business, trade or profession), as long as they          are stated to achieve the objective of the DPSP.
10
The DPSP are seen as aids          to interpret the Constitution, and more specifically to provide the basis,          scope and extent of the content of a fundamental right.
To quote again          from the  Fundamen­tal Rights case:
Fundamental rights have            themselves no fixed content; most of them are empty vessels into which            each generation must pour its content in the light of its experience.
Restrictions, abridgement, curtailment and even abrogation of these            rights in circum­stances not visualised by the constitution makers might            become necessary; their claim to supremacy or priority is liable to            be overborne at particular stages in the history of the nation by the            moral claims embodied in Part IV.
11
Judicial Activism and Public          Interest Litigation
The internal emergency that          was in force between 1975 and 1977 and its aftermath contrib­uted significantly          to the change in the judiciarys perception of its role in the working          of the Constitution.
The period of the emergency witnessed large-scale          violations of basic rights of life and liberty.
There were also blatant          violations of the right to freedom of speech and expression.
The end          of the emergency saw the emergence of a realignment of political forces.
Nevertheless, the popularly elected government was weak and in trying          to find its feet, it did not last very long.
It was already collapsing          by 1978/1979, which was when the judiciary initiated the public-interest          litigation (PIL) movement.
The development of the jurisprudence of ESC          rights is also inextricably linked to this significant development.
The lifting of the emergency          and the realignment of political forces had not resulted in any dramatic          change in the social imbalances or executive excesses that had by then          become en­demic.
The postemergency period then provided the right environment          for the judiciary to redeem itself as a protector and enforcer of the          rule of law.
Judges woke up to this need and PIL was the tool the judiciary          shaped to achieve this end.
PIL was entirely a judge-led and judge-dominated          movement.
12
What made PIL unique was that          it acknowledged that a majority of the population, on account of their          social, economic and other disabilities, was unable to access the justice          sys­tem.
The insurmountable walls of procedure were dismantled and suddenly          the doors of the Supreme Court were open to people and issues that had          never reached there before.
By relaxing the rules of standing and procedure          to the point where even a postcard could be treated as a writ petition,          the judiciary ushered in a new phase of activism where litigants were          freed from the stranglehold of formal law and lawyering.
The Maneka Gandhi Case and Thereafter
Simultaneously, the judiciary          took upon itself the task of infusing into the constitutional pro­visions          the spirit of social justice.
This it did in a series of cases of which Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India was a landmark.
13   The case involved the refusal by the government to grant a passport to          the petitioner, which thus restrained her liberty to travel.
In answering          the question whether this denial could be sustained without a predecisional          hearing, the court proceeded to explain the scope and content of the right          to life and liberty.
In a departure from the earlier view, 14 the court asserted the doctrine of substantive due process as integral          to the chapter on fundamental rights and emanating from a collective understanding          of the scheme underlying articles 14 (the right to equality), 19 (the          freedoms) and 21 (the right to life).
The power the court has to strike          down legislation was thus broadened to include critical examination of          the substantive due process element in statutes.
Once the court took a broader          view of the scope and content of the fundamental right to life and liberty,          there was no looking back.
Article 21 was interpreted to include a bundle          of other incidental and integral rights, many of them in the nature of          ESC rights.
In Francis Coralie Mullin the court declared:
The right to life            includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes with            it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition,            clothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and expressing            oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and comingling            with fellow human beings.
The magnitude and components of this right            would depend upon the extent of economic develop­ment of the country,            but it must, in any view of the matter, include the bare necessi­ties            of life and also the right to carry on such functions and activities            as constitute the bare minimum expression of the human self.
 15
The combined effect of the          expanded interpretation of the right to life and the use of PIL as a tool          led the court into areas where there was a crying need for social justice.
These were areas where there was a direct interaction between law and          poverty, as in the case of bonded labor and child labor, and crime and          poverty, as in the case of undertrials in jails.
In reading several of          these concomitant rights of dignity, living conditions, health into the          ambit of the right to life, the court overcame the difficulty of justiciability          of these as economic and social rights, which were hitherto, in their          manifestation as DPSP, considered nonenforceable.
A brief look at how          some of these ESC rights were dealt with by the court in four specific          contexts will help understand the development of the law in this area.
Right to Work
Article 41 of the Constitution          provides that the State shall within the limits of its economic          capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right          to work, to educa­tion and to public assistance in cases of unemployment,          old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want.
 16 Article 38 states that the state shall strive to pro­mote the welfare          of the people and article 43 states it shall endeavor to secure a living          wage and a decent standard of life to all workers.
One of the contexts          in which the problem of enforceability of such a right was posed before          the Supreme Court was of large-scale aboli­tion of posts of village officers          in the State of Tamil Nadu in India.
In negating the conten­tion that          such an abolition of posts would fall foul of the DPSP, the court said:
It is no doubt true that            Article 38 and Article 43 of the Constitution insist that the State            should endeavour to find sufficient work for the people so that they            may put their capacity to work into economic use and earn a fairly good            living.
But these articles do not mean that everybody should be provided            with a job in the civil service of the State and if a person is provided            with one he should not be asked to leave it even for a just cause.
If it were not so, there would be justification for a small per­centage            of the population being in Government service and in receipt of regular            income and a large majority of them remaining outside with no guaranteed            means of living.
It would certainly be an ideal state of affairs if            work could be found for all the able-bodied men and women and everybody            is guaranteed the right to participate in the production of national            wealth and to enjoy the fruits thereof.
But we are today far away from            that goal.
The question whether a person who ceases to be a government            servant according to law should be rehabilitated by being given an alternative            employment is, as the law stands today, a matter of policy on which            the court has no voice.
17
But the court has since then          felt freer to interfere even in areas which would have been con­sidered          to be in the domain of the policy of the executive.
Where the issue was          of regulariz­ing the services of a large number of casual (nonpermanent)          workers in the posts and tele­graphs department of the government, the          court has not hesitated to invoke the DPSP to direct such regularization.
The explanation was:
Even though the above directive            principle may not be enforceable as such by virtue of Article 37 of            the Constitution of India, it may be relied upon by the petitioners            to show that in the instant case they have been subjected to hostile            discrimination.
It is urged that the State cannot deny at least the            minimum pay in the pay scales of regu­larly employed workmen even though            the Government may not be compelled to extend all the benefits enjoyed            by regularly recruited employees.
We are of the view that such denial            amounts to exploitation of labour.
The Government cannot take ad­vantage            of its dominant position, and compel any worker to work even as a casual            labourer on starvation wages.
It may be that the casual labourer has            agreed to work on such low wages.
That he has done because he has no            other choice.
It is poverty that has driven him to that state.
The            Government should be a model employer.
We are of the view that on the            facts and in the circumstances of this case the classifica­tion of employees            into regularly recruited employees and casual employees for the purpose            of paying less than the minimum pay payable to employees in the corre­sponding            regular cadres particularly in the lowest rungs of the department where            the pay scales are the lowest is not tenable . . . It is true that all            these rights cannot be extended simultaneously.
But they do indicate            the socialist goal.
The degree of achievement in this direction depends            upon the economic resources, willingness of the people to produce and            more than all the existence of industrial peace throughout the country.
Of those rights the question of security of work is of utmost importance.
18
In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, 19 a PIL by an NGO highlighted the deplorable condition of bonded laborers          in a quarry in Haryana, not very far from the Supreme Court.
A host          of protective and welfare-oriented labor legislation, including the Bonded          Labour (Abolition) Act and the Minimum Wages Act, were being observed          in the breach.
In giving extensive directions to the state government          to enable it to discharge its constitutional obligation towards the bonded          laborers, the court said: 20
The right to live with human            dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive            Principles of State Policy and particularly clauses (e) and (f) of Article            39 and Article 41 and 42 and at the least, therefore, it must include            protection of the health and strength of workers, men and women, and            of the tender age of chil­dren against abuse, opportunities and facilities            for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom            and dignity, educational facilities, just and humane conditions of work            and maternity relief.
These are the minimum require­ments which must            exist in order to enable a person to live with human dignity and no            State has the right to take any action which will deprive a person of            the enjoyment of these basic essentials.
Since the Directive Principles            of State Policy contained in clauses (e) and (f) of Article 39, Articles            41 and 42 are not enforceable in a court of law, it may not be possible            to compel the State through the judicial process to make provision by            statutory enactment or executive fiat for ensuring these basic essentials            which go to make up a life of human dignity, but where legislation is            already enacted by the State providing these basic requirements to the            workmen and thus investing their right to live with basic human dignity,            with concrete reality and content, the State can certainly be obligated            to ensure observance of such legislation, for inaction on the part of            the State in securing implementation of such legislation would amount            to denial of the right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article            21, more so in the context of Article 256 which provides that the executive            power of every State shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with            the laws made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that            State.
21
Thus the court converted what          seemed a non-justiciable issue into a justiciable one by in­voking the          wide sweep of the enforceable article 21.
More recently, the court performed          a similar exercise when, in the context of articles 21 and 42, it evolved          legally binding guide­lines to deal with the problems of sexual harassment          of women at the work place.
22
The right of workmen to be          heard at the stage of winding up of a company was a contentious issue.
In a bench of five judges that heard the case the judges that constituted          the majority that upheld the right were three.
The justification for          the right was traced to the newly inserted article 43-A, which asked the          state to take suitable steps to secure participation of workers in management.
The court observed:
It is therefore idle to            contend 32 years after coming into force of the Constitution and particularly            after the introduction of article 43-A in the Constitution that the            workers should have no voice in the determination of the question whether            the enterprises should continue to run or be shut down under an order            of the court.
It would indeed be strange that the workers who have            contributed to the building of the enterprise as a centre of economic            power should have no right to be heard when it is sought to demolish            that centre of economic power.
23
Right to Shelter
Unlike certain other ESC rights,          the right to shelter, which forms part of the right to an ade­quate standard          of living under article 11 of the ICESCR, finds no corresponding expression          in the DPSP.
This right has been seen as forming part of article 21 itself.
The court has gone as far as to say, The right to life . . . would          take within its sweep the right to food . . . and a reasonable accommodation          to live in.
 24 However,          given that these observations were not made in a petition by a homeless          person seeking shelter, it is doubtful that this declaration would be          in the nature of a positive right that could be said to be enforceable.
On the other hand, in certain other contexts with regard to housing for          the poor, the court has actually refused to recognize any such absolute          right.
In Olga Tellis v. Bombay          Municipal Corporation, 25 the court held that the right to life included the right to livelihood.
The petitioners contended that since they would be deprived of their livelihood          if they were evicted from their slum and pavement dwellings, their evic­tion          would be tantamount to deprivation of their life and hence be unconstitutional.
The court, however, was not prepared to go that far.
It denied that contention,          saying:
No one has the right to            make use of a public property for a private purpose without requisite            authorisation and, therefore, it is erroneous to contend that pavement            dwellers have the right to encroach upon pavements by constructing dwellings            thereon . . . If a person puts up a dwelling on the pavement, whatever            may be the economic compulsions behind such an act, his use of the pavement            would become unauthorised.
Later benches of the Supreme          Court have followed the Olga Tellis dictum with approval.
In Municipal          Corporation of Delhi v. Gurnam Kaur, 26 the court held that the Municipal  Corpo­ration of Delhi had no legal          obligation to provide pavement squatters alternative shops for rehabilitation          as the squatters had no legal enforceable right.
In Sodan Singh v.          NDMC 27 a constitution          bench of the Supreme Court reiterated that the question whether there          can at all be a fundamental right of a citizen to occupy a particular          place on the pavement where he can squat and engage in trade must be answered          in the negative.
These cases fail to account for socioeconomic compulsions          that give rise to pavement dwelling and restrict their examina­tion of          the problem from a purely statutory point of view rather than the human          rights perspective.
Fortunately, a different note          has been struck in a recent decision of the court.
In Ahmedabad Municipal          Corporation v. Nawab Khan Gulab Khan, 28 in the context of eviction of encroach­ers in a busy locality of Ahmedabad          city, the court said:
Due to want of facilities            and opportunities, the right to residence and settlement is an illusion            to the rural and urban poor.
Articles 38, 39 and 46 mandate the State,            as its economic policy, to provide socio-economic justice to minimise            inequalities in income and in opportunities and status.
It positively            charges the State to distribute its largesse to the weaker sections            of the society envisaged in Article 46 to make socio-economic justice            a reality, meaningful and fruitful so as to make life worth living with            dignity of person and equality of status and to constantly improve excellence.
Though no person has a right to encroach and erect structures or otherwise            on foot­paths, pavements or public streets or any other place reserved            or earmarked for a public purpose, the State has the constitutional            duty to provide adequate facilities and opportunities by distributing            its wealth and resources for settlement of life and erection of shelter            over their heads to make the right to life meaningful.
29
Right to Health
The right to health has been          perhaps the least difficult area for the court in terms of justiciability,          but not in terms of enforceability.
Article 47 of DPSP provides for the          duty of the state to improve public health.
However, the court has always          recognized the right to health as being an inte­gral part of the right          to life.
30 The principle          got tested in the case of an agricultural laborer whose condition, after          a fall from a running train, worsened considerably when as many as seven          government hospitals in Calcutta refused to admit him as they did not          have beds vacant.
The Supreme Court did not stop at declaring the right          to health to be a fundamental right and at enforcing that right of the          laborer by asking the Government of West Bengal to pay him compensation          for the loss suffered.
It directed the government to formulate a blue          print for primary health care with particular reference to treatment of          patients during an emergency.
31
In Consumer Education and          Research Centre v. Union of India 32 the court, in a PIL, tackled the problem of the health of workers in the          asbestos industry.
Noticing that long years of expo­sure to the harmful          chemical could result in debilitating asbestosis, the court mandated com­pulsory          health insurance for every worker as enforcement of the workers          fundamental right to health.
It is again in PIL that the court has had          occasion to examine the quality of drugs and medicines being marketed          in the country and even ask that some of them be banned.

A note of caution was struck          when government employees protested against the reduction of their entitlements          to medical care.
The court said:
No State or country can            have unlimited resources to spend on any of its projects.
That is why            it only approves its projects to the extent it is feasible.
The same            holds good for providing medical facilities to its citizens including            its employees.
Provi­sion on facilities cannot be unlimited.
It has            to be to the extent finances permit.
If no scale or rate is fixed then            in case private clinics or hospitals increase their rate to exorbitant            scales, the State would be bound to reimburse the same.
The principle            of fixation of rate and scale under the new policy is justified and            cannot be held to be violative of article 21 or article 47 of the Constitution.

Right to Education
Article 45 of the DPSP, which          corresponds to article 13(1) of the ICESCR, states, The State shall          endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from the commencement          of this Con­stitution, for free and compulsory education for all children          until they complete the age of fourteen years.
  Thus, while the          right of a child not to be employed in hazardous industries was, by virtue          of article 24, recognized to be a fundamental right, the childs          right to educa­tion was put into the DPSP in part IV and deferred for          a period of ten years.
The question whether the right          to education was a fundamental right and enforceable as such was answered          by the Supreme Court in the affirmative in Mohini Jain v. State of          Karna­taka.
35 The          correctness of this decision was examined by a larger bench of five judges          in Unnikrishnan J.P. v. State of Andhra Pradesh.
36 The occasion was the challenge, by private medical and engineering          colleges, to state legislation regulating the charging of capitation fees from students seeking admission.
The college management was seeking          enforcement of their right to business.
The court expressly denied this          claim and proceeded to examine the nature of the right to education.
The court refused to accept the nonenforceablity of the DPSP.
It asked:
It is noteworthy that among            the several articles in Part IV, only Article 45 speaks of a time-limit;            no other article does.
Has it no significance?
Is it a mere pious            wish, even after 44 years of the Constitution?
Can the State flout            the said direction even after 44 years on the ground that the article            merely calls upon it to endeavour to pro­vide the same and on the further            ground that the said article is not enforceable by virtue of the declaration            in Article 37.
Does not the passage of 44 yearsmore than four            times the period stipulated in Article 45convert the obligation            created by the article into an enforceable right?
In this context,            we feel constrained to say that allo­cation of available funds to different            sectors of education in India discloses an inver­sion of priorities            indicated by the Constitution.
The Constitution contemplated a crash            programme being undertaken by the State to achieve the goal set out            in Article 45.
It is relevant to notice that Article 45 does not speak            of the limits of its economic capacity and development as            does Article 41, which inter alia speaks of right to education.
What            has actually happened is more money is spent and more attention is directed            to higher education than toand at the cost ofprimary educa­tion.
(By primary education, we mean the education which a normal child receives            by the time he completes 14 years of age.)
Neglected more so are the            rural sectors, and the weaker sections of the society referred to in            Article 46.
We clarify, we are not seeking to lay down the priorities            for the Governmentwe are only emphasising the constitutional policy            as disclosed by Articles 45, 46 and 41.
Surely the wisdom of these            constitutional provisions is beyond question.
37
The court then proceeded to          examine how this right would be enforceable and to what extent.
It clarified          the issue thus:
The right to education further            means that a citizen has a right to call upon the State to provide educational            facilities to him within the limits of its economic capacity and development.
By saying so, we are not transferring Article 41 from Part IV to Part            IIIwe are merely relying upon Article 41 to illustrate the content            of the right to education flowing from Article 21.
We cannot believe            that any State would say that it need not provide education to its people            even within the limits of its economic capacity and development.
It            goes without saying that the limits of economic capac­ity are, ordinarily            speaking, matters within the subjective satisfaction of the State.
38
More caution followed.
The          courts apprehension clearly was that recognition of such a right          might open the flood gates for other claims.
It clarified:
We must hasten to add that            just because we have relied upon some of the directive principles to            locate the parameters of the right to education implicit in Article            21, it does not follow automatically that each and every obligation            referred to in Part IV gets automatically included within the purview            of Article 21.
We have held the right to education to be implicit in            the right to life because of its inherent fundamental importance.
As            a matter of fact, we have referred to Articles 41, 45 and 46 merely            to determine the parameters of the said right.
39
In fact, the court had broken          new ground in the matter of justiciability and enforceability of the DPSP.
The decision in Unnikrishnan has been applied by the court in formulating          broad parameters for compliance by the government in the matter of eradication          of child labor.
This it did in a PIL where it said:
Now, strictly speaking a            strong case exists to invoke the aid of Article 41 of the Con­stitution            regarding the right to work and to give meaning to what has been provided            in Article 47 relating to raising of standard of living of the population,            and Articles 39 (e) and (f) as to non-abuse of tender age of children            and giving opportunities and facilities to them to develop in a healthy            manner, for asking the State to see that an adult member of the family,            whose child is in employment in a factory or a mine or in other hazardous            work, gets a job anywhere, in lieu of the child.
This would also see            the fulfilment of the wish contained in Article 41 after about half            a century of its being in the paramount parchment, like primary education            desired by Article 45, having been given the status of fundamental right            by the decision in Unnikrishnan.
We are, however, not asking            the State at this stage to ensure alternative employment in every case            covered by Article 24, as Article 41 speaks about right to work within            the limits of the economic capacity and development of the State.
The very large number of child labour in the aforesaid occupations would            require giving of job to a very large number of adults, if we were to            ask the appropriate Government to assure alternative employment in every            case, which would strain the resources of the State, in case it would            not have been able to secure job for an adult in a private sector es­tablishment            or, for that matter, in a public sector organisation.
We are not issuing            any direction to do so presently.
Instead, we leave the matter to be            sorted out by the appropriate Government.
In those cases where it would            not be possible to provide job as above mentioned, the appropriate Government            would, as its contribution/grant, deposit in the aforesaid Fund a sum            of Rs.5000/- for each child employed in a factory or mine or in any            other hazardous employment.
40
The court, while recognizing          the importance of declaring the childs negative right against exploitation          and positive right to education, chose a pragmatic approach when it came          to en­forceability.
Earlier the court would have shrugged off the whole          issue as not being within its domain.
That has now changed as is clear          from the recent trend of cases.
Conclusion
This much is clear from the          above narrationthat ESC rights are no less important than fun­damental          rights in the constitutional scheme.
They are enforceable when they are          projected as supplying the content of a fundamental right, 41 but not just by themselves.
42
The judiciary will not be          fettered by any apparent injunction in the Constitution against non-enforceability          of the DPSP.
It will, on the other hand, pin the state to its obligations          towards the citizens by referring to the DPSP.
Such obligation, the court          has explained in the context of right to environment, can confer corresponding          rights on the citizen:
It need hardly be added            that the duty cast on the State under Articles 47 and 48-A in particular            of Part IV of the Constitution is to be read as conferring a corresponding            right on the citizens and, therefore, the right under Article 21 at            least must be read to include the same within its ambit.
At this point            of time, the effect of the quality of the environment on the life of            the inhabitants is much too obvious to require any emphasis or elaboration.
43
The ESC rights that the DPSP          symbolize can demonstrably be read as forming part of an enforceable regime          of fundamental rights.
What then is crucial is the will of the state          to im­plement this constitutional mandate.
The agenda of the state can          be shaped to a considerable extent by a creative and activist judiciary.
The state has to be constantly reminded of its ob­ligations and duties.
The actual realization of ESC rights may be a long-drawn affair, but keeping          it on the agenda is more than half that effort.
The Indian judiciary          has through a combination of strategies done just that.
That is the Indian          experience.

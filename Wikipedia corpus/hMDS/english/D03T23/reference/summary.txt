The Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties are sections of the Constitution of India that prescribe the fundamental obligations of the State to its citizens and the duties of the citizens to the State.
These sections comprise a constitutional bill of rights for government policy-making and the behaviour and conduct of citizens.
These sections are considered vital elements of the constitution, which was developed between 1947 and 1949 by the Constituent Assembly of India.
The Fundamental Rights is defined as the basic human rights of all citizens.
These rights, defined in Part III of the Constitution, apply irrespective of race, place of birth, religion, caste, creed or gender.
They are enforceable by the courts, subject to specific restrictions.
The Directive Principles of State Policy are guidelines for the framing of laws by the government.
These provisions, set out in Part IV of the Constitution, are not enforceable by the courts, but the principles on which they are based are fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in framing and passing laws.
The Fundamental Duties are defined as the moral obligations of all citizens to help promote a spirit of patriotism and to uphold the unity of India.
These duties, set out in Part IVâ€“A of the Constitution, concern individuals and the nation.
Like the Directive Principles, they are not legally enforceable.

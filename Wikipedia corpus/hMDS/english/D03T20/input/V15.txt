Summary
"Hark the herald angels sing: Mrs. Simpson's pinched our King"
by GuyStephenson
Wallis Simpson, 1936 - Credit: Wikimedia Commons
This play on the traditional hymn references the constitutional crisis that erupted in England in 1936 when King Edward VIII decided to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice divorced American socialite.
Edward's engagement was opposed by his government.
However, Edward persisted, and abdicated his throne in December 1936 to marry the woman he loved.
He was the only English monarch to abdicate his position since Anglo-Saxon times.
His brother Albert succeeded him, becoming George VI.
Edward became the Duke of Windsor and married Simpson six months later.
They remained together until his death 35 years later.

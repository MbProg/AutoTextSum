Eldest son of King George V he was a popular Prince of Wales seen as a handsome young modernising influence on royal institutions.
He served in the Army during World War I but was forbidden to go to the front line.
He was known as David to his family, but his relationship with his parents deteriorated as he became a celebrity playboy who failed to settle down and had several affairs with married women.
He became King Edward VIII in January 1936 on the death of his father George V.
In November 1936 a constitutional crisis arose when Edward wished to marry Mrs Wallis Simpson; it was felt that, as a she had already divorced her first husband and at the time Edward and Wallis had met she was still married to her second husband, she was pursuing the King because of his wealth and position and would be unacceptable as queen.
On 11 December Edward abdicated and left for France, where the couple were married in 1937.
He was succeeded by his brother Albert as George VI.
Edward and Wallis became The Duke and Duchess of Windsor, but were ostracised by his family who felt he had let them down and not done his duty.
His views of appeasement on the rise of fascism in Germany and Italy and meeting with Adolf Hitler in 1937 led him to be given the role during World War II of Governor of the Bahamas out of the way of the war effort amid concerns of German plots to kidnap and use him.
After the war they became mild celebrities in Europe and America but lived mostly in Paris where he died in 1972.
They had no children.

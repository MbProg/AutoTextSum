In 1936 Edward VIII of England married divorcee Wallis Simpson, triggering a constitutional crisis throughout the British Empire.
Religious, legal, political, and moral objections were raised to the marriage, and the king was forced to abdicate.
Historically, everything was settled peaceably - but what if the king had refused to abdicate, and matters came to a head?
The result - A Very British Civil War!
Cricket on the village green.
Crumpets for afternoon tea.
Warfare conducted in a civilized 'after you, old chap!'
fashion.
Gimcrack weapons, do-it-yourself uniforms and improvised structures.
And this little dry stone wall, boilerplate and corrugated iron blockhouse to defend home and hearth, in the finest British make-do manner!
Built to 28mm, this blockhouse makes a useful addition to any tabletop gaming set-up.
Measuring 6 3/4 by 5 1/4 by 3 inches tall, the roof lifts off to allow figures to be placed inside.
The embrasures allow figures to fire out in safety.
There's even a chimney pipe, showing a stove is provided for that vital British institution - the cuppa!
(The figure is not included in this sale).

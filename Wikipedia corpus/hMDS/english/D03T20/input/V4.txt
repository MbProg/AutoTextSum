Description
We can hardly imagine a Britain without Elizabeth II on the throne.
And yet for much of her early life the young princess did not know the role that her future would hold.
She was our accidental Queen.
In 1936, King-Emperor Edward VIII abdicated the throne over his proposed marriage to a divorcee, leaving eleven-year-old Elizabeth—daughter of Edward’s brother and successor, George VI—heiress to the throne.
Author Kate Williams explores the sheltered upbringing of the young princess; her complicated relationship with her sister, Princess Margaret; the profound and devastating impact of the abdication crisis; and how, at age 25, Elizabeth assumed the throne, determined to create a new kind of monarchy and carving out a lasting legacy for herself amid the sweeping changes of the twentieth century.
Young Elizabeth offers a thrilling portrait of the woman who ushered Britain’s monarchy into the modern age.

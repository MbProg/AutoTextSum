The Athenaeum is hosted in the United States, so we apply United States copyright law.
Copyright law may      differ based on where you live - it is your responsibility to understand and abide by the law of your local jurisdiction,     even if The Athenaeum lists an artwork as public domain in the United States.
Our Approach:
Here at The Athenaeum, we work very hard to make this site a sanctuary from the commercial web.
We want to provide 99%             of our content for free (and currently, *all* of it is free), and not to blast you with advertising.
However, we are not a               rich company or foundation.
This site is a labour of love produced over many years by a couple of people.
Since late 2000              when we started the site, we have invested thousands of dollars of our personal money to keep it going.
Currently, the hosting service               costs us about $200 a month.
If you would like to support The Athenaeum, you can donate directly through Paypal below, or shop using any    of the links on this page.

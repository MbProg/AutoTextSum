<h3><a id="January" name="January"></a>January</h3>
<p><strong>January 11th</strong> <strong>&ndash; </strong><em>Southern Christian Leadership Conference Organized</em> </p>
<p>On this day in 1957, a group of about 60 ministers and activists gathered in Atlanta to form a new organization to protest segregation across the South. In August 1957, the new organization, led by Dr. King, held a convention in Montgomery and named itself the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The SCLC became one of the leading civil rights organizations in the United States. The SCLC would launch one protest after another. The campaigns in Albany, Birmingham, Selma, and Chattanooga, would become the defining struggles of the movement. These campaigns often ended in court decisions, legislation, and significant shifts in public opinion that eventually ended Jim Crow segregation. Martin Luther King Jr. served the SCLC from its founding in 1957 until his death in 1968.</p>
<p><strong>January 12th </strong>&ndash; <em>CORE Founder James Farmer Born</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1920, James Farmer, future founder of CORE was born. James Farmer, a native of Texas, entered college at the age of 14. &nbsp;He went on to earn a divinity degree from Howard University. &nbsp;After working for FOR, a Quaker organization, Farmer found his own organization to institute change. He would name his organization CORE- the Congress of Racial Equality, a pacifist organization with a stated purpose of creating a society where &ldquo;race or creed will be neither asset nor handicap.&rdquo; &nbsp;In 1947, FOR and CORE engaged in the first freedom ride, where black and white students rode desegregated buses into the South to pit the federal government against Jim Crow segregation. Farmer retired from CORE in 1966, due to a militant nationalism that had crept into CORE. In 1998, Farmer was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by then President Bill Clinton. He died one year later.</p>
<p><strong>January 13th</strong> &ndash; <em>Delta Sigma Theta Formed</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1913, 22 African American Women formed Delta Sigma Theta at Howard University. The organization began with women&rsquo;s suffrage and human welfare at its core. With stated aims of bettering the community and affecting public policy, this large, powerful organization claims over 200,000 members in 900 chapters around the world. Delta Theta&rsquo;s impressive list of former members include, singers Roberta Flak, and Aretha Franklin, poet Nikki Giovanni, and actress Lena Horne. With its emphasis on social activism, human welfare, and equality, and service to the larger community, Delta Sigma Theta, reared dozens of influential women who went on to lead in the civil rights movement. </p>
<p><strong>January 14th</strong> &ndash; <em>George Wallace Pledges &lsquo;Segregation Forever&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1963, Governor George C. Wallace delivered his infamous inaugural address. He pledged the state of Alabama to the segregationist cause, thus raising the stakes for the movement across the South. Oddly enough four years earlier Wallace campaigned against the KKK, and had the endorsement of the NAACP. After losing the race in 1958, he famously declared &ldquo; I&rsquo;ll never be out-niggered again.&rdquo; He was elected in 1962 and declared &ldquo; Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!&rdquo; &nbsp;Under Wallace, Alabama became a focal point for the civil rights movement. It was to Wallace that the Selma-to-Montgomery marchers planned to deliver the body of Jimmy Lee Jackson. It was at Wallace&rsquo;s feet that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. laid the blame for the church bombing in Birmingham that claimed the life of four girls. As time went on Wallace expressed regret and tried to make amends. In 1972, Wallace was shot and partially paralyzed by an assassin. In the late 1970&rsquo;s Wallace embraced Christianity and publicly apologized to African American leaders for his past actions. He died in 1998.</p>
<p><strong>January 15th</strong> &nbsp;&ndash; <em>Martin Luther King Jr. Born</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1929, Martin Luther King Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia. After graduating from Morehouse College, King entered the post-graduate-theological program at Boston University. It was there that he was introduced to the non-violent studies of Mohandas K. Ghandi. &nbsp;While in Boston he met Coretta Scott. The couple returned to Atlanta, where King would accepted the pastorate of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. &nbsp;In 1955 Rosa Parks was arrested and the Montgomery Bus Boycotts were soon underway, with 26 year-old Martin Luther King Jr. as its spokesperson. King formed the SCLC, guided by his doctrine of nonviolent civil disobedience and his unparalleled oratory skills. In 1964 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Harassed throughout his adult life by police, Klansmen, street thugs, and the FBI, King was stabbed, beaten, jailed, shot at, and his home was bombed. King never relented, and was unfortunately assassinated in 1968</p>
<p><strong>January 16th</strong> &nbsp;&ndash;<em> Lurleen Wallace Becomes Surrogate Governor</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1967, Lurleen Wallace succeeded her husband as Governor of Alabama. The ambitious George C. Wallace was barred from running for governor again, based on term limits set forth in the 1901 Alabama Constitution. Wallace enacted a plan to have his wife run with the understanding the he would govern behind the scenes. Lurleen Wallace was inaugurated in 1967. Her husband&rsquo;s policies remained in effect and his cronies still in control. &nbsp;Lurleen died in 1968, succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Albert Brewer. Wallace overturned the one term limit on Alabama governors. He returned to the governors chair in 1971. George Wallace is remembered as one of the great antagonists of the civil rights movement. Lurleen Wallace is remembered as a decent woman who was used by her husband for his own political ends.</p>
<p><strong>January 17th</strong> <strong>&ndash; </strong><em>Chicago Campaign Brings New Movement Tactic</em></p>
<p> On this day in 1966, &nbsp;Chicago&rsquo;s Coordinating Council of Community Organizations invited Martin Luther King Jr. to the windy city. The Chicago Campaign was a massive community-oriented project designed to break the slums of America&rsquo;s biggest city. On January 26, 1966, King and his family moved into a renovated apartment in one of Chicago&rsquo;s worst neighborhoods. This well publicized move was intended to bring attention to the destitute living conditions. King also began to focus on peace abroad, connecting racism at home to militarism around the world. The Vietnam War weighed heavily on his conscience, &ldquo;Violence is as wrong in Hanoi as it is in Harlem&rdquo; he proclaimed. King was mired in a bureaucratic labyrinth that seemed to have no end. He began the Chicago Campaign worn out and weary.</p>
<p><strong>January 25th</strong> &ndash; <em>National Afro-American League Formed</em><br />
On this day in 1890, journalist Timothy Thomas Fortune co-founded the National Afro-American League in Chicago. Born a slave and self educated, Fortune moved to New York in 1881 and started what eventually became the New York Age, one of the leading black papers of the era. Fortune was a trailblazing muck-raker. He eventually became friends with Booker T. Washington,  but later had a falling out over their different views. The Afro-American League challenged commonly held assumptions about race and equality. African Americans constituted 11 percent of the country's population, but existed on the fringe. The AAL and Fortune spoke out against lynching, mob violence, and discrimination of all forms. The public was not ready to listen, and the AAL disbanded after only four years. Even though little was accomplished, the concept was revolutionary, serving as a springboard for other national Negro Organizations.<br />
<br />
<strong>January 26th</strong> &ndash; <em>Activist Angela Davis Born</em><br />
On this day in 1944, political activist and educator Angela Davis was born in a section of Birmingham nicknamed "Dynamite Hill." Davis left Birmingham to attend the Elizabeth Irwin School in New York City and later Brandeis University. She studied philosophy and became interested in Marxism. She later attended a doctoral program in Germany, but returned in 1967 to take part in civil rights events in the United States. She moved to Southern California in the late 1960's and became affiliated with the Black Panthers. She taught philosophy at UCLA, but was fired for her affiliation with the American Communist Party. Davis was placed on the FBI's most wanted list, for going into hiding after being accused of providing handguns to prisoners during a failed prison escape. Davis was captured 2 months later and spent 18 months in prison.  A "Free Angela Movement" began, and centered on her treatment and upcoming trial. She was eventually acquitted of all charges. Since then, Davis has spent much her time working on prison reform, while advocating democratic socialism.<br />
<br />
<strong>January 27th</strong> &ndash; <em>Abolitionist, Civil Rights ForeRunner David Ruggles Born</em><br />
On this day in 1810, early abolitionist and writer David Ruggles was born. Raised in Connecticut, Ruggles focused on the antislavery movement in 1833. He began writing for The Emancipator and Public Morals, an abolitionist journal in New York. Ruggles later published a magazine, Mirror of Liberty, recognized by many as the first periodical owned by a person of color. Ruggles worked as a conductor for the Underground Railroad in 1835, reputedly helping to free more than 1,000 slaves. A notable public agitator, Ruggles, committed numerous acts of civil disobedience. A committed activist, Ruggles, like many of the early abolitionists, was a man ahead of his time. <br />
<br />
<strong>January 28th</strong> &ndash; <em>Mississippi Congressman Bennie Thompson Born</em><br />
On this day in 1948, Bennie Thompson, a grassroots volunteer, labor organizer, student activist, community leader, and politician was born in Bolton, Mississippi. Thompson earned degrees from Tougaloo College and Jackson State University. He was a plaintiff, in 1975, for the case of Ayers v. Musgrove. This lawsuit was over the historically gross underfunding of black universities in comparison to white universities. The case eventually settled in 2004, with some $500 million in compensatory funding. Thompson began as an alderman in his hometown, was then elected mayor, then county supervisor, and finally, in 1993, as the U.S. Representative for Mississippi's second congressional district. In Congress, Thompson serves on the House Budget and Agriculture committees and he is the ranking Democrat on the House's Homeland Security committee.<br />
<br />
<strong>January 29th</strong> &ndash; <em>Harriet Tubman Born</em><br />
On this day in 1820, Harriet Ross Tubman was born a slave in Maryland. When she was16, an angry overseer smashed her head with a rock, almost killing her. She suffered from blackouts for the rest of her life. During a black out she had an epiphany: she had to escape. She left her husband behind, and made her way to Philadelphia and freedom. She became the most famous Underground Railroad conductor. Known as"Moses," Tubman made many trips to the South, leading groups of slaves to freedom.  In her tenure as an Underground Railroad conductor, she never lost a single passenger. Tubman became a notorious figure in the late 1840's, with a $40,000 reward offered for her capture. She met many of the era's most famous antislavery figures, including John Brown, who called her " one of the bravest persons on the continent." During the Civil War, she worked as a spy, nurse, and scout for the Union Army. After the war, Tubman continued to work for equal rights for African Americans, while also expanding into women's issues. She died in 1913 at age 92 and was buried with full military honors.<br />
<br />
<strong>January 30th</strong> &ndash; <em>Boycott Leader's Home Bombed In Montgomery</em> <br />
On this day in 1956, the parsonage of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church - then the home of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. - was bombed with dynamite. The attack was part of the violent reaction by white supremacists to the bus boycott. The boycott was already achieving success, and the then 26 year old, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was already recognized locally and nationally as the leader and spokesperson of a well organized challenge against legalized segregation. He was a key target to local KKK, to stop the boycott. When the bundle of dynamite was tossed on the porch of the parsonage, King was not at home. His wife Coretta, their daughter Yolanda, and a family friend were at home. They survived the blast as they were all in the kitchen when the bomb tore apart the front of the house. King sped home, he made sure his family was okay, then went back outside. King turned to the crowd and asked for silence, he then said " We believe in law and order. Don't do anything panicky. Don't get your weapons. He who lives by the sword will perish by the sword. Remember that is what God said. We are not advocating violence. We want to love our enemies and let them know you love them."<br />
<br />
<strong>January 31st</strong> &ndash; <em>13th Amendment Abolishes Slavery</em><br />
On this day in 1865, Congress passed the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery in the United States forever. At the start of the 19th century, abolitionists gained footholds in many major American cities, eventually birthing a political party, the Republicans, using the slogan, "Free soil, free labor, free speech, free men." The Compromise of 1850, between the North and South, to improve the conflict had the opposite effect. John Brown's failed revolt of 1859, combined with volatile viewpoints of the North and South, eventually led to the Civil War. Slavery was an essential motivation, the South to save its precious economic institution and the North to eliminate the practice. At the end of the war, the North occupied the South during Reconstruction. Sadly, Reconstruction failed, and southern whites regained power. Jim Crow segregation and economic subjugation resulted. The 13th Amendment remained, but no one seemed ready to act on it. It would be almost another hundred years before the United States government would revisit these broken promises. </p>

<p><strong>February 1st</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><strong>&ndash; </strong><em>Student Sit in Movement Begins</em> </p>
<p class="Body">On this day in 1960, four African American students from North Carolina A&amp;T College entered a Woolworth's department store, sat down at the lunch counter, and demanded to be served.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service was denied so the four young men - Franklin McCain, Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, and Joseph McNeil - sat quietly at the lunch counter until the store closed.&nbsp; The next day 25 men and 4 women continued the protest.&nbsp; The third day, students filled 63 of the 65 lunch counter seats.&nbsp; On February 4th, four white students joined the protest.&nbsp; Within a week more than 300 students were "sitting-in" in Greensboro.&nbsp; With this deliberate action, these young men launched a movement that spread rapidly throughout the area.&nbsp; Within two months, the sit-ins had spread to more than 50 cities in 9 states.&nbsp; By July Woolworth's desegregated its lunch counter.&nbsp; The effect of the sit-ins changed the focus of the civil rights movement from litigation to confrontation and personal challenges of discriminatory conditions.&nbsp; The movement became more volatile and sped up the process of desegregation. &nbsp;The Greensboro sit-ins led directly to the organization of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>February 2nd </strong>&ndash; <em>Evelyn J. Fields, Maritime Pioneer, Takes the Helm</em></p>
<p class="Body">On this day in 1989, Evelyn J. Fields became the first African American woman to command a U.S. Government oceangoing vessel.&nbsp; She began her career with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1972 as an cartographer. &nbsp;She was then commissioned as an ensign and served as a junior officer on board the <em>Mt. Mitchell</em>.&nbsp; She later became operations officer on board the <em>Pierce</em>, then executive officer, and finally commanding officer on the <em>McArthur</em>.&nbsp; After her sea tours, Fields took part in the U.S. Department of Commerce's Science and Technology Fellowship Program.&nbsp; She went on to become a rear admiral, the director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine and Aviation Operations, and director of the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps.&nbsp; Fields' list of honors and commendations is endless.&nbsp; Among the highest are the Metcalfe Health, Education, and Science Award from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the U.S. Department of Commerce Gold Medal, and the Lowell Thomas Explorer Award.&nbsp; Rear Admiral Fields is a member of several professional societies.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>February 3rd</strong> &ndash; <em>15th Amendment Ratified</em></p>
<p class="Body">On this day in 1870, the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified.&nbsp; The 13th Amendment had outlawed slavery, and the14th gave full U.S. citizenship to former slaves.&nbsp; However, Republicans worried that ex-Confederates would attempt to regain political control, so congress passed the 15th Amendment hoping to secure forever the rights of freed slaves.&nbsp; This amendment empowered blacks across the South during Reconstruction.&nbsp; Thousands of African Americans were elected to political office. The Congress and the state legislatures began passing radical measures to eliminate all race-based laws.&nbsp; At the same time they instituted reforms such as a universal public education.&nbsp; The Democrats saw this as an intolerable threat.&nbsp; President U.S. Grant ended up sending troops to New Orleans to disband a white mob angry over interracial government.&nbsp; Grant's successor, Rutherford B. Hayes, withdrew the troops and ended many of the policies that protected African Americans.&nbsp; Reconstruction was essentially over.&nbsp; Southern legislatures passed various measures establishing Jim Crow segregation.&nbsp; White terrorist groups such as the KKK frightened blacks into submission.&nbsp; The bleak state of affairs lasted 100 years after the civil war, when the 1965 Voting Rights Act was signed by president Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>February 4th </strong>&nbsp;&ndash; <em>Civil Rights Icon Rosa Parks Born</em></p>
<p class="Body">On this day in 1913, Rosa Louise McCauley was born in Tuskegee, Alabama.&nbsp; She attended high school in Montgomery, dropping out when her family fell on difficult times.&nbsp; She became a house servant and later married Raymond Parks and finished high school.&nbsp; In 1943 Parks joined the NAACP.&nbsp; She was a sponsor for the NAACP youth chapter and was quiet activist for ten years before the incident that made her famous.&nbsp; On December 1, 1955 Parks boarded a segregated city bus.&nbsp; She was ordered to give her seat up to a white man.&nbsp; She refused to move and was arrested.&nbsp; Parks' arrest provoked the Montgomery bus boycott and made her an instant heroine of the civil rights movement.&nbsp; Following the boycott Parks and her husband had difficulty finding work.&nbsp; They moved to Detroit, Michigan where she worked as a staff member for Representative John Conyers from 1965 to 1988.&nbsp; Over the years Parks became known as the "Mother of the civil rights movement."&nbsp; Schools and streets have been named for her, she has received thousands of awards, there is a museum in her honor in Montgomery, and the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development conducts educational work on her behalf.&nbsp; Rosa Parks died on October 24, 2005.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>February 5th</strong>&nbsp; &ndash; <em>First Black Postmistress Becomes Political Issue</em></p>
<p class="Body">On this day in1869, Minnie Cox, the first black postmistress in the United States was born in Lexington, Mississippi.&nbsp; Cox was a teacher at the Indianola Colored Public School, where her husband was the principal.&nbsp; In 1891 President Harrison appointed Cox postmistress of Indianola.&nbsp; At the same time, the backlash to reconstruction took hold.&nbsp; A vast conspiracy to remove blacks from political positions was in full swing.&nbsp; Whites in Indianola delivered a petition demanding Cox's resignation.&nbsp; Cox refused, harassment increased, and she eventually resigned.&nbsp; However, President Theodore Roosevelt, who had worked to improve relations with black communities, refused her resignation.&nbsp; He closed the Indianola post office and rerouted the mail through Greenville, Mississippi.&nbsp; Out of&nbsp; harms way, Cox continued to receive her salary.&nbsp; The issue of her job was a battle on the Senate floor for over four hours.&nbsp; Roosevelt stood firm that Cox would remain postmistress unless critics could prove a reason, other than skin color, for her dismissal.&nbsp; In 1904 Cox's term ended and the Indianola post office reopened with a white postmistress.&nbsp; Minnie Cox died in 1933.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>February 6th</strong>&nbsp; &ndash;<em> </em><em>Peabody Fund Established</em></p>
<p class="Body">On this day in 1867,&nbsp; the Peabody Fund was established.&nbsp; George Peabody was a wealthy industrialist and considered by many to be the first American Philanthropist.&nbsp; He established the Peabody Fund "for the promotion and encouragement of intellectual, moral, or industrial education among the more destitute portions of the south and southwest states of our Union."&nbsp; The fund was to help develop public education in the eleven former Confederate states.&nbsp; It stabilized struggling schools and provided money to build new ones.&nbsp; The fund's money was delivered systematically to maximize its impact.&nbsp; Communities had to raise funds, through taxes or otherwise, to match the grant.&nbsp; This was in keeping with Peabody's philosophy of self reliance. The Peabody Fund was great success.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>February 7th</strong> <strong>&ndash; </strong><em>Negro History Week Established</em></p>

for its failure during the 20th century to make lynching a
federal crime.&nbsp; Between 1882 and 1968 approximately

Reconstruction period, ex-confederates founded the
Ku Klux Klan.&nbsp; Its existence spurred on thousands of
lynch mobs.&nbsp; During President Hayes, term the

<br />
<strong>June 16th</strong> &ndash; <em>Attorney General Meets With Civil Rights Leaders</em><br />
On this day in 1961, U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy met with Civil Rights leaders. The meeting, while productive, was uncomfortable. The Kennedy brothers encouraged voter-registration, but wanted an end to mass demonstrations, sit ins, freedom rides, and other confrontational activities.&nbsp; President Kennedy needed the white southern vote to win the election in 1964.&nbsp; Thurgood Marshall was appointed to a federal judgeship; and with Robert Kennedy The Voter Education Project was formed. The Kennedys were inconsistent during the civil rights movement. They would turn a deaf ear to black American protests, while at other times become a staunch ally.<br />

On this day in 1964, civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Shwerner disappeared on the back roads of Philadelphia, Mississippi. Their bodies were found six weeks later. Shwerener and Goodman arrived in Mississippi to answer the call of the SNCC, for the Freedom Summer campaign. The two were sent off with Chaney to investigate the bombings of a&nbsp; black church. All three were arrested on suspicion of arson, and taken to jail by Sheriff Lawrence Rainey and Deputy Cecil Price, both KKK members. Evidence later showed that a KKK conspiracy to murder them was forming. The three were released after dark and run off the road by several cars full of Klan members. They were kidnapped, shot, and buried in a dirt dam at a fishpond. When the young men did not return to SNCC headquarters, calls were made to John Doar, U.S. Justice Department representative in Mississippi, who then called the FBI.&nbsp; For 40 days the U.S. government searched for the men, along with 400 Navy personnel. The bodies were found August 4th. The nation got a violent lesson about segregation and the conditions in Mississippi. In 2005, Klansman Edgar Ray Killen was prosecuted and convicted of the murders of all three men.</p>

<p><strong>June 23rd</strong> &ndash; <em>Murderer Of Medgar Evers Arrested In Mississippi </em></p>
<p>On this day in 1963, Byron De La Beckwith was charged with the murder of Medgar Evers. Considered a cowardly killing, Evers was shot in the back in front of his children. &nbsp;The police found the weapon and traced it back to Beckwith, a virulent, outspoken racist, with ties to the KKK. &nbsp;Despite strong evidence, an all-white jury was unable to convict in 1964. &nbsp;Few were surprised by the verdict due to the climate in Mississippi. Governor Ross Barnett, one of the shameless racist demagogues of the era, shook Beckwith&rsquo;s hand as a mistrial was announced. &nbsp;Two months later a second trial resulted in a hung jury. Documents would later reveal the KKK had tampered with by the juries. Thirty years later Beckwith would be re-indicted and retried. &nbsp;&nbsp;Evers, a military veteran, is buried in Arlington National Cemetery</p>

The message of the day was economic justice, the war in Vietnam, and poverty at home. &nbsp;Despite poignant and eloquent speeches, the Poor People&rsquo;s Campaign failed to deliver anything concrete. Five days later, Resurrection City was torn down by the police.</p>
<p><strong>June 25th</strong> &ndash; <em>Black Swimmers Attacked In St. Augustine, Florida</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1964, white mobs attacked black swimmers trying to desegregate a beach. &nbsp;After earlier success at the Monson Motor Lodge, black protesters began challenging the segregated beachfronts, which by law had already been desegregated. &nbsp;On June 17th, 35 African American swimmers began a &ldquo;wade-in.&rdquo; &nbsp;A few days later they returned, but were met by angry white mobs. &nbsp;&nbsp;That evening a Klan-inspired riot broke through police lines. &nbsp;Twenty African Americans were injured. On June 30th, the Florida governor asked civil rights leaders to suspend activities; in return a biracial committee would be established and protesters&rsquo; demands would be reviewed. &nbsp;King viewed this as a public victory.</p>

<p>On this day in 1967, ACLU attorney Chuck Morgan, an up and coming lawyer in Birmingham, worked on civil rights cases from his office in Atlanta. &nbsp;Speaking at a civic club meeting, Morgan spoke of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing, laying blame for four girls&rsquo; deaths on the indifference of white Birminghamians and collusion with racists.&nbsp; Birmingham whites were not ready to hear this message.&nbsp; As a result, Morgan&rsquo;s legal career was ruined and he soon left the state. Morgan joined the ACLU and was named director of its southern regional office. He began working for civil rights through high-profile legal cases. He worked on jury selection, voting rights, voting districts, free speech, racial violence, and more. Two of his high profile cases involved Julian Bond and Muhammad Ali. &nbsp;He won both cases. During the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s, the ACLU worked in tandem with the NAACP, and played a role in the landmark <em>Brown v.</em> <em>Board of Education</em> case in 1954. </p>

<p>On this day in 1965, In a dense jungle area, 3,000 U.S. soldiers engaged the Vietcong.&nbsp; The majority of the U.S. population was in support of the Vietnam war. &nbsp;Many civil rights leaders were cautious in talking about the war, feeling that if they came out against the war, they would alienate middle America and jeopardize the gains they had achieved in civil rights.&nbsp; Others called the war racist, accusing the United States as treating black men as expendable. &nbsp;This accusation was in part true.&nbsp; Most black GI&rsquo;s were enlisted as infantrymen most likely to be on the front lines.&nbsp; However, it was not black participation in the war that led civil rights leaders to criticize it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin Luther King Jr. saw a connection between U.S. militarism abroad and social unrest at home.&nbsp; The money being spent on the war took away from public programs.&nbsp; King felt a responsibility to speak out on what he saw as unjust. </p>
<p><strong>June 30th</strong> &ndash; <em>Supreme Court Upholds the NAACP Membership Privacy </em></p>
<p>On this day in 1958, the Supreme Court agreed with the NAACP in a dispute with the state of Alabama over privacy rights.&nbsp; After the success of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, white officials in Alabama wanted to punish black organizations, with the NAACP being the biggest target.&nbsp; Alabama demanded the NAACP release its membership lists in accordance with a law.&nbsp; The NAACP refused and a state court held the organization in contempt.&nbsp; Eventually the Supreme Court ruled that the NAACP had the right to keep its membership lists private, and the contempt charge was dropped.&nbsp; Ironically, this Supreme Court ruling would later be used by Ku Klux Klan groups in an attempt to shield their members from civil lawsuits.</p>

<p>On this day in 1943, Clarence Jordan continued to develop an experimental society in rural Georgia.  At a young age, Jordan wanted to work on food-supply issues and economics with the hope of bettering human life.  With a degree in agriculture and a PhD in Greek Theology he merged the two disciplines and founded the Koininia Farm.  Koininia is the Greek word for fellowship.  The Koininia community was an interracial community with people living off the land, sharing meals, possessions, and Bible classes.  Koininian beliefs included equal brotherhood, avoiding racism, militarism, and sexism.   The KKK destroyed the Koininia property in a series of bombings.  By the end of the 1960s the community changed its name to Koininia Partners, launching partnership programs in which members came together to build affordable housing for poor families.

He felt the courts could do away with segregation while the consequent education advances would put an end to economic disparity.   Unfortunately Myrdal underestimated the opposition to integration. </p>

His proposal included an anti-lynching law, a Fair Employment Practices Commission, a Civil Rights Commission, and immediate desegregation of the armed forces.  His proposal became bogged down in congress.  In response to the threat of a black boycott of the military, Truman desegregated the military by executive order rather than waiting for approval of an amendment. </p>

On this day in 1834, England  outlawed slavery throughout its colonies.&nbsp;  Slavery was formally abolished in England proper in the late 1700s.&nbsp; However, profitability and practicality  justified the preservation of large slave owning colonies.&nbsp; While England could afford to eliminate  slavery at home, it raked in the profits from slavery abroad.&nbsp; The islands of Jamaica, Trinidad, and others  were converted into huge sugar and tobacco plantations.&nbsp; Anti-slavery activists worked to eliminate  slavery throughout the English empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;  In 1827, England passed a law declaring all slavery illegal, punishable  by death.&nbsp; In 1834 slavery was abolished  throughout the British Empire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On this day in 1906, delegates to the historic 1905 conference reconvened in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The Niagara Movement insisted that accepting separate but equal policies, as Booker T. Washington preached, was a strategic mistake for African Americans. The Niagara Movement severely undercut Washington&rsquo;s standing within the African American community and was a precursor to the 1909 founding of the NAACP. &nbsp;W.E B. Du Bois said to his fellow participants that every African American needs to involve themselves in every level of American Society. Over the next few years, the Niagara members would tirelessly promote these objectives, but never gained widespread membership. Within a few years Du Bois would turn his energies to the new NAACP.</p>
<p><strong>August 18th </strong>&ndash; <em>Niagara Role Illustrates Women&rsquo;s Challenges</em></p>

Du Bois, John Hope, Monroe Trotter, and others, held a secret meeting to develop strategies in the home of Mary Burnett Talbert, a prominent Buffalo, NY activist and suffragette. </p>

<p>On this day in 1938, The National Lawyers Guild continued its second year of operation. Founded in 1937, the National Lawyers Guild was the first racially integrated legal association. The NLG&rsquo;s aim was &ldquo;to eliminate racism; to safeguard and strengthen the rights of workers, women, farmers, and minority groups; to maintain and protect our civil rights and liberties in the face of persistent attacks upon them; to use the laws as an instrument for the protection of the people, rather than foe their repression.&rdquo; In the late 1930&rsquo;s the NLG helped organize the United Auto Workers and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.&nbsp; The NLG&rsquo;s core beliefs place it at the legal epicenter of the American left in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
<p><strong>August 20th</strong> &ndash;<em>Nat Turner Plots His Rebellion</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1831, Nat Turner prepared for the slave rebellion that would become the most famous of the slave uprisings. Nat Turner was born into slavery in Virginia around 1800. He was a religious child, prone to visions, prophecy, and solitary talks with God. By the age of 21, Turner became know as the &ldquo;Prophet.&rdquo; In 1831, Turner witnessed a solar eclipse. He took that as a sign from God to lead a slave revolt. &nbsp;On August 13th, the sun turned odd colors, Turner took this as a second sign. In the early morning hours of August 21st, Turner and six other men broke in to their master&rsquo;s houses and killed the families. They then rode on horseback through the Virginia countryside killing every white person they saw. They had killed 50 white slave owners and families over two days. By midday of August 22nd, white militiamen scattered Turner&rsquo;s forces. He escaped into the woods, the manhunt for Turner continued for over two months until his capture on October 30th.

The group attempted to portray a united front, but this was not the case. Young and Wilkins represented the conservative arm of the movement, McKissick and Carmichaels the radicals, and King was in the middle. The leaders were civil to each other as they debated. The most contentious issue was non-violence. </p>
<p><strong>August 22nd</strong> &nbsp;&ndash;<em> Black Panthers&rsquo; CoFounder Killed By Street Thug</em></p>

They seemed poised to become a voice for African Americans. &nbsp;However, murder trials would undermine the group&rsquo;s legitimacy. Many leaders were sent to jail. &nbsp;The organization eroded from within and membership began dwindling.&nbsp; For a time, the BPP offered at least a concept of an alternative, progressive, community-based approach to African American issues.</p>
<p><strong>August 23rd &ndash; </strong><em>Segregationist Mississippi Delegation Challenged</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1964, the media reported the efforts of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party&rsquo;s challenge to unseat the all-white regular Mississippi delegation to the Democratic National Convention. &nbsp;The newly formed MFDP elected and sent 68 delegates to the DNC in Atlantic City.&nbsp; Most of them were former sharecroppers with little formal education. The MFDC was given a chance to state its case before the Credentials Committee. They laid out the reasons why it should replace the regular Mississippi delegates. Fannie Lou Hamer was called upon, and in horrifying detail, she recounted a savage beating she took from Mississippi police. &ldquo;All of this is on account we want to register, to become first-class citizens, and if the Freedom Democratic party is not seated now, I question America, is this America?&rdquo; she thundered.&nbsp; </p>

<p>On this day in 1967, J. Edgar Hoover, FBI Director, began the Counter-Intelligence Program against communist, African American, and anti-war organizations.&nbsp; The purpose of Cointelpro was to weaken and neutralize activities of black, nationalist organizations.&nbsp; It would also gather information about extremist groups, such as the The Black Panthers, the KKK, and the Weathermen.&nbsp; Hoover was convinced that black groups like the NAACP, SCLC, and SNCC were saturated with communist agents. Phones were tapped, offices were burglarized, and illegal substances were planted.&nbsp; Fake literature was distributed that misrepresented various groups&rsquo; beliefs or practices.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cointelpro was effective.&nbsp; Its activities partially explain why there is still misinformation about different figures in the movement.&nbsp; Cointelpro was exposed in 1970.</p>
<p><strong>August 26th</strong> &ndash; <em>Chicago Campaign Ends Inconclusively</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1966, a summit was held in Chicago to agree over protesters demands, avoid violence, and save face for those involved with the Chicago campaign.

<p>On this day in 1895, Booker T. Washington delivered the &ldquo;Atlanta Compromise&rdquo; speech at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta. Washington&rsquo;s controversial and still-debated speech is one of the most noteworthy in American History. Washington&rsquo;s solution to the South&rsquo;s &ldquo;Negro problem&rdquo; was to encourage African Americans to become proficient in practical, mechanical labor, accept segregation as a way of life, and become self reliant. Blacks should build their own communities and institutions, as Washington did with The Tuskegee Institute. &nbsp;The white media lauded his speech and ideas, while black intellectuals criticized it. Washington&rsquo;s most vocal critic was his former friend W.E.B. DuBois, who began calling him&rdquo; the Great Accommodator.&rdquo;</p>

Evidence was strong and six eyewitnesses testified to the pair taking the boy from his uncle&rsquo;s home. &nbsp;Mississippi whites began to rally around the two defendants. Five defense attorneys volunteered their services and a defense fund was set up. The defense used a familiar tactic: Don&rsquo;t let outsiders tell Mississippians how to run their lives. The racially charged defense worked, and both Bryant and Milam were found not guilty, by an all white jury, even after admitting they kidnapped the boy. Two months later, William Bradford Huie paid the two men to tell their story. Because of their acquittal, Double Jeopardy laws prevented them from being tried again. They recounted in chilling detail how they intended to scare Till to comply with local racial customs. When he refused and did not beg for mercy, they killed him. Kidnapping charges were brought upon both men, but were later found not guilty again.</p>
<p><strong>September 20th &ndash; </strong><em>Maryland Passes First Miscegenation Law</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1664, Maryland passed the first Miscegenation Law, banning inter-racial marriage in the Unite States. As African slavery became more widespread, both laws and customs became more restrictive. The impetus for the ban was their offspring. What legal status should a person of mixed race be afforded? Maryland also barred slaves from owning property. In the West, miscegenation laws applied to Mexicans and to American Indians. A sexual caste system was in place. During Reconstruction, Radical Republicans overturned some miscegenation laws. The Black Codes then emerged to limit all interaction between black and white. White supremacy held that non-whites where genetically inferior. In 1958, Richard Loving, a white man, and Mildred Jeter, a black woman, were married in Washington, D.C. When they returned to Virginia they were arrested. A nine-year legal battle ensued. In 1967, the Supreme Court declared miscegenation laws unconstitutional.</p>

Faubus withdrew the National Guardsmen, clearing the way for the angry mob to overpower the local police.&nbsp; On September 24, President Dwight D. Eisenhower dispatched 1,200 troops to restore order. &nbsp;The next day the students, under armed escort, were allowed to enter school.&nbsp; </p>

The KCCR prohibited discrimination in state employment, and in 1961, a boycott called &ldquo;Nothing New for Easter&rdquo; was enacted against white businesses that remained segregated. In 1964, Martin Luther King, Mahalia Jackson, Ralph Abernathy, and Jackie Robinson, lead a 10,000 strong demonstration in Frankfurt, KY, for a public accommodations bill. Kentucky passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act in 1966.</p>
<p><strong>October 14th</strong> &ndash; <em>Confederate Flag Controversy In South Carolina</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1998, debate continued over the Confederate Flag that flew over the state capitol. African-Americans wanted it removed, while South Carolinians wanted it to remain. South Carolina served as a major entry point for incoming slaves and was the first state to secede from the Union. South Carolina elected &ldquo;Pitchfork Ben &ldquo; Tillman as governor. He was a vehement racist and white supremacist. He enacted harsh Jim Crow laws across the state. After Tillman, Strom Thurmond, would carry on his malicious traditions, first as governor, then as senator. In 1962, the all-white South Carolina legislature voted to place the Confederate Flag on top of the capitol building. In 2000, the National Urban League, PUSH, and the NAACP called for a state tourism boycott until the flag was removed. In April, lawmakers voted to take the flag down. </p>
<p><strong>October 15th</strong> &ndash;<em> Black Panther Party Officially Organized</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1966, the Black Panther Party was officially organized. The creators of the party were Bobby Seale and Huey Newton. The Black Panther Party followed a radical manifesto. Newton and Seale began recruiting in Oakland, CA. The new organization&rsquo;s 10 points plan demanded full employment for African-Americans; decent, affordable housing; a fair and balanced education; universal exemption from military service; an end to police brutality; release of all black prisoners; and &ldquo;land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice, and peace.&rdquo; The slow pace of integration is what led many black youths to join the BPP. The BPP offered self-empowerment and black pride. The Panthers&rsquo; message was that freedom would never be granted by the oppressor, it had to be taken by force.</p>
<p><strong>October 16th</strong> &nbsp;&ndash; <em>&lsquo;Million Man March&rsquo; In D.C.</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1995, upwards of 900,000 African Americans, mostly men, held a rally in Washington, D.C. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Rodney King riots in Los Angeles, demonstrated a continued racial divide. The Million Man March was the brainchild of The Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan. &nbsp;&nbsp;His idea was to bring together hundreds of thousands of blacks together to commit to bettering their communities. The March was one of the largest rallies in U.S. history. &nbsp;Many influential speakers attended the event, such as Maya Angelou, Rosa Parks, Jesse Jackson, and Stevie Wonder. The energetic tone of the day, combined with the non-violence, made this March appear to be a success. However, many women activists felt slighted. A Million Woman March took shape on October 25th, 1997. This day of unity and celebration, was attended by 500,000, mostly African American, women. </p>
<p><strong>October 17th</strong> &ndash;<em> Department Stores Integrate Lunch Counters</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1960, Woolworth, Grant, Kresge, and McCrory announced they would desegregate their lunch counters and department stores across the country. In February 1960, students in Greensboro, North Carolina, and later in Nashville, Tennessee, embarked on a &ldquo;sit-in&rdquo; campaign to desegregate lunch counters in their cities. The first students to take part were; Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain. These students formed the Student Executive Committee for Justice. Their strategy was to have white and black students sit at lunch counters until they were served. The first sit-in protesters were assaulted, humiliated, or arrested. Recognizing this campaign was gaining momentum, at the end of February 1960, CORE and the SCLC called for a nationwide boycott of Woolworth&rsquo;s stores. The protest spread to Grant, Kresge, and McCrory department stores. Negative publicity and slipping profits proved to be too much. Woolworth and the others announced they would integrate their stores.</p>
<p><strong>October 18th &ndash; </strong><em>Paul Robeson Receives Springarn Medal</em></p>
<p> On this day in 1945, Paul Robeson received the Springarn medal from the NAACP.&nbsp; Robeson was one of the first African Americans to get a law degree from Columbia University Law School.&nbsp; However, Robeson was drawn to the stage and left behind his promising legal career.&nbsp; After receiving a prominent role in the 1922 musical <em>Shuffle Along</em>, his acting career flourished.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1939 Robeson joined leftist political movements, including the Council on African Affairs and the American Communist Party.&nbsp; He used his fame to criticize American policy.&nbsp; His political views made him a target for the House Un-American Activities Committee.&nbsp; He was blacklisted by Hollywood, investigated by the FBI, and had his passport revoked.&nbsp; In 1961 Robeson attempted suicide.&nbsp; He survived, but suffered from severe depression until his death in 1976.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>October 26th</strong> <strong>&ndash; </strong><em>Mahalia Jackson Born</em> </p>
<p>On this day in 1911, Mahalia Jackson, a gospel singer whose voice and spirit would inspire the civil rights movement, was born in New Orleans. &nbsp;Mahalia Jackson grew up in the renowned &ldquo;Black Pearl&rdquo; neighborhood of New Orleans. &nbsp;In 1927, Jackson moved to Chicago and began singing with the Johnson Brothers, one of the earliest professional Gospel groups. &nbsp;In 1948 she hit the big time with her record, &ldquo;Move On Up a Little Higher.&rdquo; &nbsp;She became an international star, loved by both black and white audiences. &nbsp;She won awards in both France and Norway. &nbsp;Viewing her career as mission work, she sang at special events including the inauguration of John F. Kennedy, and the 1963 March on Washington. &nbsp;In 1968, she sang at the funeral for her friend, Martin Luther King Jr. &nbsp;She retired from music in 1971, and died in Chicago a year later. More than 50,000 attended her funeral.</p>
<p><strong>October 27th </strong>&ndash; <em>Birth Of Ruby Dee, Partner To Ossie Davis</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1924, actress and civil rights campaigner Rudy Dee was born. Dee shared a lifetime of activism, along with her husband Ossie Davis. They met in 1946, and the two maintained a loving marriage while hurdling social, artistic, and racial barriers. &nbsp;They were both friends of Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. &nbsp;In February of 1965, Davis delivered the eulogy for the slain Malcom X. &nbsp;In 1968, Davis delivered a second eulogy, this time for King. &nbsp;Dee and Davis were vocal supporters and ardent fundraisers. The played crucial roles in the civil rights movement. </p>
<p><strong>October 28th</strong> &ndash; <em>John Brown Convicted, Hanged</em></p>
<p>On This day in 1859, John Brown underwent his second trial on charges of treason, murder, and conspiring with slaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;After the prosecution and defense concluded their cases, John Brown made a statement: &ldquo;If it is necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the end of justice and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I say, let it be done.&rdquo; &nbsp;More than 2,000 spectators assembled as Brown kissed a slave child on the way from his cell to the gallows. He thanked his executioners (including guard John Wilkes Booth) and was hanged.</p>
<p><strong>October 29th</strong> &ndash;<em> Supreme Court Shuts Door On Integration Delays</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court again ruled on school desegregation, in the case of <em>Alexander v. Board of Education. </em>Despite <em>Brown I and II, </em>most Southern schools remained segregated. In some cities it was de facto segregation that left public schools divided. Only a handful of schools integrated, and without stricter guidelines, public school integration was a challenge. After hearing the arguments, the Supreme Court ruled the immediate desegregation of the schools. The dual school system was to be abolished. The Supreme Court did not outline explicit ways for the schools to integrate. As a result, thousands of so-called &ldquo;seg-academics&rdquo; sprang up in the Southern school districts. Over the next two decades re-segregation occurred due to residential patterns, private school enrollments, and federal emphasis on desegregation. At the beginning of the 21st century, some school districts, especially in the south, were almost as segregated as they were in the 1950&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><strong>October 30th</strong> &nbsp;&ndash; <em>Juanita Stout, Pioneering Pennsylvania Judge Completes First Week On The Bench</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1959, Juanita Stout completed her first week as the first African American female judge of the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia. &nbsp;Born in Wewoka, Oklahoma in 1919, Stout grew up in a segregated town with a segregated school system. In 1948 she completed her J.D. degree at Indiana University. She passed the Pennsylvania bar exam in 1954, and joined the district attorney&rsquo;s office as an assistant DA, and was promoted to chief of appeals, pardons, and paroles. Stout was appointed to a judgeship in the Philadelphia municipal courts. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy appointed Stout as a special ambassador to the Kenya Independence Celebration. She received the Woman Lawyer of the year in 1965, and the AFL-CIO&rsquo;s Good Citizen Award in 1971. In 1988, Stout was named to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>October 31st</strong> &ndash;<em> Andrew Young Serves As Atlanta Mayor </em></p>

<h3><a id="Niovember" name="Niovember"></a>November</h3>
<p><strong>November 1st &ndash; </strong><em>First Protest Action In Albany Movement</em></p>
<p> On this day in 1961, SNCC operatives Cordell Reagon and Charles Sherrod tested federal law by trying to patronize the segregated bus facilities in Albany, Georgia. Their actions ignited the beginning of the Albany Movement. Months earlier, three SNCC workers had moved into Albany for the voting rights campaign. Sherrod, Reagon, and Charles Jones began recruiting new members into the SNCC. &nbsp;The local chapter of the NAACP was not thrilled with the SNCC&rsquo;s activities. The NAACP was considered conservative, and the SNCC radical. Infighting and egotism threatened any chance at unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;Without a unified front the contrasting personalities floundered while trying to organize a city-wide campaign.&nbsp; The Albany movement illustrated the internal disagreements over how to conduct the movement.&nbsp; SNCC believed in youth, long term voter drives, and education campaigns.&nbsp; The NAACP believed in patient legal battles, drawing the federal government into the proceedings with selected legal cases.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>November 2nd</strong> <strong>&ndash; </strong><em>The NAACP Launches &lsquo;The Crisis&rsquo;</em> </p>
<p>On this day in 1910, under the editorial leadership of W.E.B. DuBois, the NAACP began its first full day of work on its publication <em>The Crisis</em>. &nbsp;<em>The Crisis</em> followed in the advocacy footsteps of William Lloyd Garrison&rsquo;s <em>Liberator</em> and Frederick Douglass&rsquo;s <em>North Star</em>. &nbsp;By 1920, <em>The Crisis</em> had over 100,000 readers. The voice if the NAACP, the publication presented current affairs, reviews, poems, art, photography, and stories. DuBois and the NAACP were philosophically aligned until 1934, when DuBois broke with the mainstream NAACP message by advocating black separatism. DuBois eventually resigned and was succeeded by Roy Wilkins. <em>The Crisis</em> remains in print today as a bimonthly production.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>November 3rd </strong>&ndash; <em>Klansmen, Nazis Gun Down Five In Greensboro, N.C.</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1979, the KKK and the Nazis killed 5 people in Greensboro, N.C. in what became know as &ldquo;the Greensboro Massacre.&rdquo; Weeks earlier the Workers&rsquo; Viewpoint Organization had planned an anti-Klan rally to be held in a black housing project in Greensboro. &nbsp;The WVO assisted poor black and white textile workers to improve working conditions. &nbsp;The KKK threatened the union leaders, and as an act of defiance the WVO planned a rally against the Klan. Learning of the so called &ldquo;Death to the Klan&rdquo; rally, the KKK and the American Nazi Party organized their own event. &nbsp;The anti-Klan rally began at 11:00 A.M., and soon afterwards the Klan disrupted the event. With television cameras rolling, armed KKK and American Nazi Party members, fired at the ant-Klan parade. The incident lasted only five minutes, but in the end five leaders of the rally lay dead &ndash; Caesar Cauce, Mike Nathan, Sandi Smith, Bill Sampson, and James Waller &ndash; with ten injured. Survivors of the attack alleged conspiracy, as local police were forewarned of potential trouble, but were suspiciously absent. </p>
<p><strong>November 4th</strong> &ndash; <em>Heroine Of Central High Crisis Dies</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1999, Daisy Bates, who in 1957 was at the center of the school desegregation battle, died in Little Rock. Bates was born in 1914, and victimized by Southern justice. &nbsp;Her mother was killed by three white men, who were never prosecuted. Her devastated father left the family and disappeared. &nbsp;In 1942 she married L.C. Bates and founded the <em>Arkansas State Press</em>. Their paper was a major voice for African Americans in Arkansas. &nbsp;Daisy entered into activism and in 1952 became president of the Arkansas branch of the NAACP. &nbsp;Bates played a crucial role in organizing, planning, and orchestrating the 1957 desegregation of Little Rock&rsquo;s Central High School. As time passed she would move to Washington, D.C., and served on the Democratic National Committee, and later as a staffer on President Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s antipoverty programs. </p>
<p><strong>November 5th</strong> &ndash; <em>Clarence Thomas, Controversial Supreme Court Justice, Gets Accustomed To The Job</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1991, Clarence Thomas began his second month as an associate justice. &nbsp;In 1974, Thomas graduated from Yale Law School, and eventually came across the black conservative economist Thomas Sowell. &nbsp;Sowell led Thomas towards a philosophy of free-market capitalism and self-reliance. &nbsp;In 1990 President George H.W. Bush nominated Thomas to the Supreme Court to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall. &nbsp;During the confirmation hearings, co-worker Anita Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment. &nbsp;After much debate, Thomas was confirmed by the Senate. &nbsp;His performance on the bench was as expected; he pleased states&rsquo; rights conservatives and angered liberals and civil rights organizations. &nbsp;Thomas argues that blacks in America have to stand alone. &nbsp;He has consistently voted against cases that would benefit black causes. </p>
<p><strong>November 6th</strong> &nbsp;&ndash; <em>Civil Rights Legend Bob Moses Unlocks The Secrets Of Higher Math For Inner &ndash;City Students</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1983, former SNCC leader Bob Moses fine-tuned a teaching initiative that would become the Algebra Project. Born in New York in 1935, Moses taught Math in New York for three years before joining the SNCC in 1960. He was one of the principal organizers of Mississippi Freedom Summer. In 1966 Moses resigned from his post. He moved to Tanzania to work with Ministry of Education. &nbsp;In 1976, Moses returned to the United States to acquire his PhD from Harvard. In 1982, Moses was awarded a five-year MacArthur Foundation &ldquo;Genius Fellowship.&rdquo; He returned to teaching, where he realized that black and Latino inner-city students were not learning Math. The Algebra Project began as an inner-city initiative in which teachers would use real-world situations, such as bus and subway schedules, to teach students abstract math.</p>
<p><strong>November 7th</strong> &ndash;<em> Louis Farrakhan, Incendiary Religious Leader, Recuperates From Surgery.</em></p>
<p>On this day in 2001, Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan, was recuperating from emergency cancer surgery. The Nation of Islam began in 1930 under Wallace Fard. &nbsp;Fard &nbsp;altered the traditional five pillars of Islam with a new black-centered cosmology. In his mythology, Africans were the only people in an earthly paradise, until a power-mad black scientist unleashed a diabolical race of white demons. &nbsp;The NOI offered independent schools for children, community centers, and other social programs, while teaching black pride. &nbsp;The NOI&rsquo;s black nationalism was a precursor to the Black Panther Party.&nbsp; In 1952, Malcom X joined the NOI. &nbsp;In 1961, he met with the KKK to discuss a separate black state within America. &nbsp;In the early 1990&rsquo;s, Farrahkan softened his rhetoric, and was principal organizer of the Million Man March in 1995.</p>
<p><strong>November 8th &ndash; </strong><em>Justice Department Officials Play Key Roles</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1962, Nicholas Katzenbach, and John Doar continued to enforce the Constitution within the U.S. Justice Dept. &nbsp;In 1961, Katzenbach, joined the Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of Legal Counsel, and was soon assistant attorney general. &nbsp;He helped oversee the desegregation of the University of Mississippi in 1962 and the desegregation of the University of Alabama in 1963. In 1964 he worked to pass the Civil Rights Act. &nbsp;Katzenbach&rsquo;s colleague, John Doar, was born in 1921 in Minneapolis. As assistant attorney general, Doar worked on many important civil rights cases from 1960 to 1967. He worked closely with many civil rights groups in Mississippi, including the SCLC, SNCC and the NAACP.&nbsp; Katzenbach, with Doar&rsquo;s input, helped draft the 1965 Voting Rights Act. &nbsp;After leaving the Justice Department, Katzenbach and Doar both went into private law practice. They are both still practicing law.</p>
<p><strong>November 9th</strong> <strong>&ndash; </strong><em>Singer James Brown Gives Movement To The Movement</em> </p>
<p>On this day in 1968, James Brown performed his new single, &ldquo;Say it Loud, I&rsquo;m Black and I&rsquo;m Proud.&rdquo; &nbsp;This became the black-pride anthem of the era.&nbsp; Brown, born in 1933 in South Carolina, was poor, uneducated, but musically talented. &nbsp;He fused blues, bop, and hard rock into the magic of soul. &nbsp;In 1966 Brown visited wounded James Meredith, this prompted Brown into civil rights circles. &nbsp;He emerged as an important social and cultural figure. &nbsp;He evolved into a beacon of black-pride and a musician-activist of the first order.</p>
<p><strong>November 10th </strong>&ndash; <em>Malcolm X Speech</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1963, Malcolm X delivered one of his most famous speeches at the Northern Negro Grass Roots Leadership Conference in Detroit. &nbsp;He proclaimed,&nbsp; &ldquo;As long as the white man sent you to Korea, you bled. &nbsp;He sent you to Germany, you bled. &nbsp;He sent you to the South Pacific to fight the Japanese, you bled. &nbsp;You bleed for white people, but when it comes to seeing your own churches being bombed and little black girls being murdered, you haven&rsquo;t got any blood. You bleed when the white man says bleed; you bite when the white man says bite; and you bark when the white man says bark. I hate to say this about us, but it&rsquo;s true. How are you going to be non-violent with Hitler, and Tojo, and somebody else you don&rsquo;t even know?...If violence is wrong in America, violence is wrong abroad. &nbsp;If it is wrong to be violent defending black women and black children and black babies and black men, then it is wrong for America to draft us and make us violent abroad in defense of her.&rdquo; &nbsp;Malcom X served as a counterpoint to Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s message of a &ldquo;beloved community&rdquo; that was ushered into existence through non-violent protest.</p>
<p><strong>November 11th</strong> &ndash; <em>Amelia Boynton Appeals For SCLC To Join Selma Protest</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1964, Amelia Boynton personally appealed to Martin Luther King to bring the SCLC to Selma to help with the voter-registration campaign. &nbsp;Boynton and her husband, S.W. Boynton worked out of their insurance office to encourage black citizens to vote. &nbsp;In 1963 SNCC activists had gone to Selma and joined with the DCVL to step up registration efforts. &nbsp;By 1964 it seemed the voter registration effort had stalled. &nbsp;While at an SCLC retreat in Birmingham, Amelia Boynton urged King to add his presence to Selma. &nbsp;The stage was set for the Selma&ndash;to-Montgomery March, that ultimately led to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p><strong>November 12th</strong> &ndash; <em>Fifth Circuit Federal Judges Enforce The Law</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1962, federal judges brought about a fundamental transformation of the nation, particularly the South. Of the judges on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, four led the way on civil rights issues: Chief Judge Elbert P. Tuttle, Richard T. Rives, John Minor Wisdom, and John Robert Brown. These judges took the precedent established by the Supreme Court in 1954 and overturned the 1896 <em>Plessy </em>doctrine of &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; and extended it to every aspect of Southern life. &nbsp;The Fifth Circuit used due-process and equal protection provided by the 14th Amendment to desegregate the South.&nbsp; Southern states tried any and all methods to evade or postpone desegregation. The superintendents, legislatures, and the governors realized they had no place to hide with regards to the desegregation process. &nbsp;Rulings were made by judges that were very unpopular with whites in their home communities, but were received by blacks as proof that God and the federal courts were on their side, at last.</p>
<p><strong>November 13th</strong> &nbsp;&ndash; <em>Laurie Pritchett, King Foil In Albany Dies</em></p>
<p>On this day in 2000, Albany, Georgia Chief of Police, Laurie Pritchett died. Pritchett was a cagey to Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC. During the Albany movement, Pritchett used a strict policy of non-confrontational law enforcement. &nbsp;He understood the one weakness of the non-violent movement: it required a violent response to harness the public and rouse the federal government to action. &nbsp;Pritchett side stepped the segregation laws by hiding under the umbrella of protecting the public order. &nbsp;When African Americans began to enter Albany jails en masse, Pritchett bussed certain high profile individuals to other areas of the state. &nbsp;Pritchett further employed a series of fines that taxed the civil rights organizations. The Albany campaign was expensive. Pritchett figured as resources dwindled, the movement would fade, the media would leave, and the activists would go elsewhere. &nbsp;He was right, the Albany movement sputtered and eventually died. </p>
<p><strong>November 14th</strong> &ndash;<em> Landmark Voting Districts Case Decided</em></p>
<p>On this day in 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court decided the case of <em>Gomillion v. Light-foot</em>, establishing an important precedent in the voting rights of African American citizens. &nbsp;The Alabama legislature passed Act 140 redefining the boundaries of the city of Tuskegee, in Macon County. This bill passed unanimously without debate in the all-white legislature. Local whites feared that prior to Act 140, that increased black voter registration would lead to eventual black control of city offices. &nbsp;Dr. C.G. Gomillion, leader of the Tuskegee Civic Association, asked attorney Fred Gray to file a federal lawsuit to have the gerrymandering declared unconstitutional. &nbsp;Attorney Gray argued the case in May 1959, and a year later the court ruled in his favor. &nbsp;The fears of local whites about black control came true. With the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the majority-black population of Tuskegee and Macon County gradually elected blacks to most major local offices.</p>
<p><strong>November 15th &ndash; </strong><em>Harry Moore Launches Florida Voter Registration</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1945, Harry Tyson Moore initiated a very successful massive voter registration drive in Florida, forming the Progressive Voters&rsquo; League.&nbsp; Moore began the first NAACP branch in Brevard County, Florida.&nbsp; In an effort to increase the NAACP&rsquo;s power, Moore established the first state conference and organized Florida&rsquo;s NAACP chapters into one unit.&nbsp; Moore was an effective campaigner for the Progressive Voters&rsquo; League.&nbsp; In 1940 there were less than 20,000 registered black voters in Florida.&nbsp; By 1950 there were more than 110,000 voters.&nbsp; Moore&rsquo;s accomplishments brought about many enemies.&nbsp; On Christmas night in 1951 a bomb exploded in Moore&rsquo;s home, killing him and his wife.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>November 16th</strong> <strong>&ndash; </strong><em>Activist Hosea Williams Dies</em> </p>
<p>On this day in 2000, activist Hosea Williams died in Atlanta after a three-year battle with cancer.&nbsp; Williams served in the army during WWII, winning the Purple Heart for being the only survivor of a German bombing run.&nbsp; He earned bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees in chemistry from Morris Brown College and Atlanta University.&nbsp; One day Williams drank form a whites only water fountain and was severely beaten by a white mob.&nbsp; It was after this event that he turned his energies to the civil rights movement.&nbsp; In 1963 he became part of the SCLC staff, eventually becoming head of the voter education division.&nbsp; He was arrested more than 100 times during his civil rights career.&nbsp; He suffered a fractured skull and concussion after being beaten on Bloody Sunday.&nbsp; After Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s death, Williams became involved in politics.&nbsp; He won terms on the Atlanta council and on the Georgia General Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>November 17th </strong>&ndash; <em>Albany Movement Launched by Rights Coalition</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1961, the SNCC, the NAACP, and local activist groups put aside their differences and formed the Albany movement.&nbsp; This movement was devoted to bringing change to the Deep South city of Albany, Georgia.&nbsp; Its goal was total and immediate desegregation of the entire city.&nbsp; Threatening a boycott of white businesses and the bus system, sit-ins at parks, libraries, and lunch counters, the Albany movement asked the city commission to create a biracial board to deal with segregation issues.&nbsp; The commission refused.&nbsp; Protests began and more than 500 African Americans were jailed.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the SNCC, NAACP, and SCLC were rarely on the same page.&nbsp; Different groups made backroom deals with the city&rsquo;s administration. The tactics of restrained oppression by local officials proved to be a difficult challenge for civil rights workers.&nbsp; Change came slowly to Albany.</p>
<p><strong>November 18th</strong> &ndash; <em>Sojourner Truth Born</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1797, Sojourner Truth, one of the most famous abolitionists and suffragettes, was born a slave in Ulster County, New York.&nbsp; Her given name was Isabella Baumfree.&nbsp; In 1827 New York abolished slavery and she moved to New York City.&nbsp; There she worked as a domestic servant for various religious communes.&nbsp; In 1843, Baumfree has a vision.&nbsp; She changed her name and walked across Long Island and Connecticut preaching gospel.&nbsp; In 1848 Truth wrote <em>The Narrative of Sojourner Truth, a Northern Slave</em>.&nbsp; The 2nd edition of her autobiography included an introduction by Harriet Beecher Stowe.&nbsp; Truth worked with famous suffragettes, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was involved in recruiting black men during the Civil War, and worked with the National Freedman&rsquo;s Relief Organization.&nbsp; A monument in Truth&rsquo;s honor was unveiled in Michigan in 1999.</p>
<p><strong>November 19th</strong> &ndash; <em>LeRoy Johnson Elected to Georgia State Senate</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1962, LeRoy Johnson served in the Georgia State Senate as the first African American elected since 1862.&nbsp; After earning a law degree from North Carolina School of Law, Johnson returned to Atlanta and began working as the first black man employed by the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; When the civil rights movement began in the late 1950s, Atlanta&rsquo;s civic and business leaders avoided the violence that many other areas of the South were enduring.&nbsp; This earned Atlanta a reputation as &ldquo;the city too busy to hate.&rdquo;&nbsp; While the civil rights movement fought to desegregate the South, Johnson became the first black Georgia state legislator since reconstruction.&nbsp; In 1969 he was named chairman of a Georgia state senate standing committee.&nbsp; He left politics in 1974, serving instead on the trustee board of Ebenezer Baptist Church.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>November 20th</strong> &nbsp;&ndash; <em>Howard University Founded</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1866, Howard University was founded in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; After the Civil War and during Reconstruction, dozens of black universities began to appear.&nbsp; However, most of the state college systems were segregated.&nbsp; Most leading black figures from Reconstruction to the mid-20th century studied in black institutions.&nbsp; African American&rsquo;s access to white-collar and professional occupations was limited until Booker T. Washington&rsquo;s success at Tuskegee Institute.&nbsp; Howard Law School Dean, Charles Hamilton Houston and his pupil, Thurgood Marshall, formed the center of the NAACP movement that brought down Jim Crow segregation.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>November 21st</strong> &ndash;<em> Jack Greenberg, Civil Rights Lawyer</em></p>
<p>On this day in 1953, Jack Greenberg and other NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) lawyers, prepared for numerous desegregation cases that eventually combined under <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>.&nbsp; One year after graduating from Columbia Law School, Greenberg joined the NAACP as a legal counselor.&nbsp; Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall may have been the primary creators of the LDF, but Greenberg played a crucial role.&nbsp; In 1954 Greenberg was a member of the team that argued and won the <em>Brown</em> case.&nbsp; When Thurgood Marshall left the LDF in 1961, Greenberg was named director-counsel in his place.&nbsp; He remained in this position until 1984, arguing 40 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.&nbsp; He left the LDF in 1984 to begin teaching at Columbia Law School, eventually becoming Dean.&nbsp; In 1994 he published his memoir, <em>Crusaders in the Courts</em>, retelling the important role the LDF lawyers played in the civil rights movement.&nbsp; In 2001, President Clinton awarded Greenberg the Presidential Citizens Medal.</p>

<p>On this day in 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.&nbsp; In 1960, Kennedy began his presidency promising to end racial segregation.&nbsp; In 1961, under Kennedy&rsquo;s command, the U.S. was involved in the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and then in the Cold War Cuban missile crisis standoff.&nbsp; He also increased U.S. involvement in Vietnam.&nbsp; He and his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, skirted civil rights issues. Kennedy was sympathetic to civil rights and met with many leaders, but refused to risk his political clout to fully endorse the movement.&nbsp; In the first half of his term, Kennedy did not lead the nation on moral issues pertinent to the civil rights movement.&nbsp; It was after the Birmingham campaign that he began to focus more strongly on the discrimination by blacks in the South.&nbsp; He had sent a civil rights bill to congress before his death.&nbsp; In Dallas on November 22, 1963, Kennedy&rsquo;s motorcade traveled slowly down Main Street.&nbsp; Kennedy was waving at the crowd when a sniper fired and fatally wounded him.&nbsp; Lee Harvey Oswald, the accused assassin, was shot and killed two days later.&nbsp; </p>

Virginia</em> case.&nbsp; The ruling in this case paved the way for later challenges involving segregated travel on all carriers.&nbsp; In 1955, the ICC banned segregation on buses traveling across state lines.&nbsp; In the 1970s and 1980s, Congress deregulated many industries and created new agencies to oversee aspects of commerce, trade, and business.&nbsp; The ICC became irrelevant and was abolished in 1995. </p>

The five young men were arrested after their &ldquo;confessions.&rdquo; They had been roaming Central Park the night of the assault. &nbsp;There was no forensic evidence linking the youths to the crime, and their confessions were coerced. &nbsp;They were convicted and served terms raging from 6 to 11 years. Only one was still in prison in 2002, when prosecutors announced they had a new confession and a DNA match from serial rapist Matias Reyes. &nbsp;This case is one of many over the past decade in which DNA testing has cleared black men wrongly accused.</p>

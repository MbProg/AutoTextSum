Amundsen reaches South Pole
Norwegian Roald Amundsen becomes the first explorer to reach the South Pole, beating his British rival, Robert Falcon Scott.
Amundsen, born in Borge, near Oslo, in 1872, was one of the great figures in polar exploration.
In 1897, he was first mate on a Belgian expedition that was the first ever to winter in the Antarctic.
In 1903, he guided the 47-ton sloop Gjöa through the Northwest Passage and around the Canadian coast, the first navigator to accomplish the treacherous journey.
Amundsen planned to be the first man to the North Pole, and he was about to embark in 1909 when he learned that the American Robert Peary had achieved the feat.
Amundsen completed his preparations and in June 1910 sailed instead for Antarctica, where the English explorer Robert F. Scott was also headed with the aim of reaching the South Pole.
In early 1911, Amundsen sailed his ship into Antarctica's Bay of Whales and set up base camp 60 miles closer to the pole than Scott.
In October, both explorers set off – Amundsen using sleigh dogs, and Scott employing Siberian motor sledges, Siberian ponies, and dogs.
On 14 December 1911, Amundsen's expedition won the race to the Pole and returned safely to base camp in late January.
Scott's expedition was less fortunate.
The motor sleds broke down, the ponies had to be shot, and the dog teams were sent back as Scott and four companions continued on foot.
On 18 January 1912, they reached the pole only to find that Amundsen had preceded them by over a month.
Weather on the return journey was exceptionally bad, and two members perished, one voluntarily.
Captain Lawrence Oates was aware that he was a burden on the team, barely able to walk and slowing the rest down from making base camp before rations ran out.
The others refused to leave him behind.
On the morning of 16 March, Scott reports that Oates remarked “I am just going outside.
I may be some time,” and left the tent in the teeth of a -40 degree Celsius blizzard, without his boots.
His sacrifice made no difference to the rest of the party: a storm later trapped Scott and the other two survivors in their tent only 11 miles from their base camp.
Their frozen bodies was found later that year.
After his historic Antarctic journey, Amundsen established a successful shipping business.
He later made attempts to become the first explorer to fly over the North Pole.
In 1925, in an airplane, he flew within 150 miles of the goal.
In 1926, he passed over the North Pole in a dirigible just three days after American explorer Richard E. Byrd had apparently done so in an aircraft.
In 1996, a diary that Byrd had kept on the flight was found that seemed to suggest that the he had turned back 150 miles short of its goal because of an oil leak, making Amundsen's dirigible expedition the first flight over the North Pole.
In 1928, Amundsen lost his life while trying to rescue a fellow explorer whose dirigible had crashed at sea near Spitsbergen, Norway.

But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the pole and subsequently return to their base camp at <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framheim" title="Framheim">Framheim</a> without loss of lives, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition.

<p>The outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Priority at the South Pole: Amundsen beat Scott to the South Pole by 34 days.</li>
<li>Fatalities: Scott lost five men including himself returning from the Pole, out of a team of 65. Amundsen's entire team of 19 returned to Norway safely.</li>
<li>Some authors (including Huntford and Fiennes) associate up to two further deaths (the drowning of Robert Brissenden and the suicide of <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjalmar_Johansen" title="Hjalmar Johansen">Hjalmar Johansen</a>) with the two expeditions, but these happened outside the Antarctic Circle.</li>

<li>Priority at the Pole: Scott wrote that Amundsen's dogs seriously threatened his Polar aspirations, because dogs, being more cold-tolerant than ponies, would be able to start earlier in the season than Scott's mixed transport of dogs, ponies and motors.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>Cherry Garrard in <i>The Worst Journey of the World</i> agreed but added that in his experience, dogs would not have been able to ascend the Beardmore Glacier.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>With regards to the causes of the deaths of Scott and his companions, Cherry-Garrard devotes chapter 19 in his book to examine the causes. Among several other factors, he surmised that <a href="#Food_and_fuel">the rations of Scott's team were inadequate</a> and did not provide enough energy for the men.<sup id="cite_ref-Apsley_Cherry_Gerrard_1921.2C_page_573_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Apsley_Cherry_Gerrard_1921.2C_page_573-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>Much of Scott's hauling was to be done by ponies, which are ill-suited to work on snow and ice without snow-shoes: their relatively small hooves and large weight caused them to sink into anything other than very firm snow or ice. Oates was opposed to snow-shoes and had left most of them at base camp.</li>
<li>Ponies' coats easily became soaked with <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">perspiration</a> during exertion, thus necessitating constant attention with blankets to avoid hypothermia through evaporation. Dogs in contrast do not have sweat glands - they cool themselves via panting, making them less vulnerable to the cold. With ponies, Scott acknowledged he could not depart until 1 November 1911 when the weather would be warmer, leaving him less time to complete the journey.</li>
<li>The loss of ponies, several of whom had drowned on disintegrating sea-ice, limited the supplies that could be hauled to the depots. Of 19 ponies brought south to aid in laying depots on the Ross Ice Shelf (traversed during the first and final quarters of the trek) nine were lost before the journey began. Further, unlike dogs which could eat the abundant <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_meat" title="Seal meat">seal</a> and penguin meat found in Antarctica, the ponies' food had to be carried forward from the ship, vastly increasing the stores that had to be transported as Scott's expedition moved towards the Pole.</li>
<li>Had the one-ton depot been placed at latitude 80°&#160;S., as planned, Scott and his two surviving companions could have reached it on their return march. Instead, because Scott refused to drive the ponies to their deaths, despite Oates' urgent advice to do so, the depot was placed some 31&#160;miles short of there. Scott’s party died only 11&#160;miles away.</li>
<li>The last-minute addition of Lieutenant Henry R. Bowers to the planned four-man pole party may have strained the rationing plans, although the death of Petty Officer Evans weeks later brought the party down to four again.</li>
<li>The rations were deficient in B and C vitamins.<sup id="cite_ref-Preston_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Preston-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The party became weaker a few weeks after reaching the Pole, despite Scott's racing ambitions before the return march, writing "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first [before Amundsen reaches the cablehead in Australia]. I wonder if we can do it."</li>
<li>The tins of cooking fuel cached along the return route were found to be partly empty, which forced the men to eat frozen food. Shortage of fuel to melt water likely caused the men to become dehydrated. Apparently the heat of the sun had vaporised part of the fuel, enabling it to escape past the corks.</li>
<li>The weather on the return march seems to have been unusually bad. In particular, when the party reached the Great Ice Barrier, the temperature was much lower than expected for the season, making the surface much less suitable for the sledge runners. Furthermore, the tail-wind which they had expected to aid them home did not appear. Scott wrote, in his final "Message to the Public": “. . . our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather. . . .”</li>
<li>The complexity of the transportation plan made it vulnerable. It depended in part on motor-sledges, ponies, dogs, and southerly winds to assist the sledges (which were fitted with sails). Half of the distance was intended to be covered by man-hauling (and sails whenever conditions permitted).</li>
</ul>
<p>Sullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive.<sup id="cite_ref-Sullivan_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sullivan-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> He states "Man is a poor <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack_animal" title="Pack animal">beast of burden</a>, as was shown in the terrible experience of Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson in their thrust to the south of 1902–3. However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were tried and true. In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-Sullivan_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sullivan-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Scott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the Pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective ("The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition"&#160;– Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the Pole ("The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object"&#160;– Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912–13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army Mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Robertson_Bowers" title="Henry Robertson Bowers">Henry Robertson Bowers</a> and <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Adrian_Wilson" title="Edward Adrian Wilson">Edward Adrian Wilson</a> in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry-Garrard" title="Cherry-Garrard" class="mw-redirect">Cherry-Garrard</a>.</p>

<p>The major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport&#160;– dog versus pony/man hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three "motor sledges". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer Lieutenant Commander <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_William_Skelton" title="Reginald William Skelton" class="mw-redirect">Reginald William Skelton</a><sup id="cite_ref-Capt_Scott_1910_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Capt_Scott_1910-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> who had created and trialled the motor sledges.

<p>Scott had used dogs on his first (<a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Expedition" title="Discovery Expedition">Discovery</a>) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs.

<p>Scott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on his <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_expedition" title="Nimrod expedition" class="mw-redirect">Nimrod expedition</a> that got to within 97.5 nautical miles (180.6&#160;km; 112.2&#160;mi) of the Pole.

When Scott, Wilson and Bowers died (Petty Officer <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Evans" title="Edgar Evans">Edgar Evans</a> and <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Oates" title="Lawrence Oates">Lawrence Oates</a> had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were 11&#160;miles short of One-Ton Depot, which was 140&#160;miles from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly three hundred miles in the same area, at the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team.<sup id="cite_ref-Apsley_Cherry-Garrard_1912.2C_page_420.E2.80.93428_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Apsley_Cherry-Garrard_1912.2C_page_420.E2.80.93428-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Scott did also blame "a prolonged blizzard". But while there is evidence to support the low temperature period, there is only evidence for a "normal" two to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>During the depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) 180&#160;miles of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using parts of empty food containers that had been prepared by painting the outside black resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on Amundsen built a 6&#160;ft cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for 5&#160;miles on either side of the depot, by that ensuring that the returning party would locate the designated depot.</p>
<p>Scott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag.</p>
<p>As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on a number of days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.</p>

<p>By the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. While the team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>)</p>
<p><a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsley_Cherry-Garrard" title="Apsley Cherry-Garrard">Apsley Cherry-Garrard</a> in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges.<sup id="cite_ref-Apsley_Cherry_Gerrard_1921.2C_page_573_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Apsley_Cherry_Gerrard_1921.2C_page_573-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a>, confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory; the British team eventually had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.</p>
<p>Scott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g. <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Adrian_Wilson" title="Edward Adrian Wilson">Wilson</a>'s trip with <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsley_Cherry-Garrard" title="Apsley Cherry-Garrard">Cherry-Garrard</a> and <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Robertson_Bowers" title="Henry Robertson Bowers">Bowers</a> to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account.</p>
<p>Since the rations contained no B and C vitamins, the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs. This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy" title="Scurvy">scurvy</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Preston_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Preston-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Scott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a known phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Dehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to the better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.</p>

<p>It has been said (by the present-day explorer <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranulph_Fiennes" title="Ranulph Fiennes">Ranulph Fiennes</a> amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loose so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.</p>
<p>Amundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late.</p>
<p>Scott's team suffered regularly from <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_blindness" title="Snow blindness" class="mw-redirect">snow blindness</a> and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> By contrast, there was no recorded case during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the "day" (while the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the "night" (while the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.</p>

Cherry-Garrard also wrote "In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February".</p>
<p>On 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hut_Point" title="Hut Point" class="mw-redirect">Hut Point</a> when, on 19 February, <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Crean_(explorer)" title="Tom Crean (explorer)">Tom Crean</a> arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Evans,_1st_Baron_Mountevans" title="Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans">Edward Evans</a> was lying seriously ill in a tent some 35 miles to the south, and in urgent need of rescue.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.</p>
<p>Atkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsley_Cherry-Garrard" title="Apsley Cherry-Garrard">Apsley Cherry-Garrard</a>. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to 'use his judgement' as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party.</p>
<p>On the return journey from the Pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes "We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt." By March 10 it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble."</p>
<p>Around March 25, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Speyer" title="Edgar Speyer">Sir Edgar Speyer</a>, that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support."

<dl>
<dt>Geology samples</dt>
<dd>Scott's team continued to haul over 14&#160;kg (30&#160;lb) of rock samples. This would appear to be a major handicap when pulling a sledge in a race against the weather and a shortage of food and fuel. Scott could have left the samples at one of the cairns along the way to be picked up later. However, Ranulph Fiennes has suggested that the extra weight would not have been a major handicap.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryggve_Gran" title="Tryggve Gran">Tryggve Gran</a> on the other hand thought "they might have saved themselves the bother".<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
<dt>Final 5-man team</dt>
<dd>Scott's planning, equipment and rations had been based on three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 days or so as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the Pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> It also meant the Evans party of three had to try and split the ration pack (at a time when they were cold and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the 5th man in Scott's party. This also will have affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to depot their skis a week before so Bowers (the 5th man) walked to the Pole and back to the depoted skis (360&#160;miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied.</dd>
<dt>Misuse of the dog team</dt>
<dd>For no clear reason Scott took the dogs on 140&#160;miles further than originally planned. This meant killing the ponies early (and starting man-hauling earlier) to feed the dogs for no obvious benefit to the overall expedition. Scott also gave conflicting and changing orders for their use to each returning party. It was only in late February 1912 that it was discovered that the final supplies needed by Scott's returning party had not been delivered to One Ton Depot. Cherry-Garrard was sent with these supplies on 25 February 1912 and he was relieved to discover that he had beaten Scott's team to the depot.<sup id="cite_ref-Apsley_Cherry-Garrard_1912.2C_page_420.E2.80.93428_19-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Apsley_Cherry-Garrard_1912.2C_page_420.E2.80.93428-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> He also found that promised supplies of dog food were not in place. Cherry-Garrard remained at the depot (within 60&#160;miles of Scott) 4–10 March 1912 when he could possibly have saved Scott, Wilson, Bowers and Oates if the management of the dog team had been better.</dd>
<dt>Navigation</dt>
<dd>Amundsen used prepared navigation sheets that simplified the calculations for his team when they were tired and cold. Four out of his team of five were qualified navigators. Amundsen's expedition also used a <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextant" title="Sextant">sextant</a> during the journey, which is a relatively light and simple piece of equipment. He also attended a symposium that reviewed how to fix position at high latitudes. Scott used a <a href="/web/20160321112302/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodolite" title="Theodolite">theodolite</a> which is heavier and requires more mental arithmetic.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> Scott also lacked navigators having only one per team. Scott dismissed Cherry-Garrard's request for navigational training and Wilson only attempted to learn how to read latitudes at the last moment.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
<dt>Camp routine</dt>
<dd>Amundsen used canisters that left his sledges permanently lashed and loaded. Scott's team had to unload, and load and relash their sledge at every camp, no matter what the weather.</dd>

He has a shorter distance to the Pole by 60 miles — I never thought he could have got so many dogs safely to the ice. His plan for running them seems excellent.

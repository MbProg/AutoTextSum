Redeployment
HISTORY
Attainment of the geographic South Pole was a primary concern of early          20th century explorers.
Tentative forays into the antarctic region had          been undertaken by several expeditions during the 19th century, but it          was not until the early 1900s that the Pole itself was considered to be          a realistic goal.
Two British expeditions, the "Discovery" expedition of 1902 and the          "Nimrod" expedition of 1908, were the first to depart for the continent          with conquest of the Pole an expressed purpose.
Robert F. Scott's "Discovery"          expedition established an initial "furthest south" record, but competing          expedition priorities prevented further progress.
In 1908, Ernest Shackleton,          a member of Scott's "furthest south" party, returned to the Antarctic          as leader of the "Nimrod" expedition.
In a remarkable feat of endurance,          Shackleton and several others came to within 97 miles of the Pole before          returning to their base at McMurdo Sound and an eventual hero's welcome          in England.
Victory, it seemed, would come to the next expedition.
Such, in fact,          proved to be the case, but it came to a Norwegian expedition, led by the          ascetic Roald Amundsen.
Amundsen, perhaps the ultimate polar technician,          had developed an interest in reaching the South Pole concurrent with the          formation of Robert Scott's second or "Terra Nova" expedition.
When Scott          sailed for the Antarctic, Amundsen was not far behind and by intent or          coincidence, a race began.
The race ended on 14 December 1911, when Amundsen and four others arrived          at the South Pole after a generally uneventful and carefully managed overland          journey.
Their return was equally uneventful.
Amundsen's almost lighthearted success contrasted starkly with the fate          of the Scott party.
Scott and four companions reach the Pole a month after          Amundsen, on 17 January 1912.
Beset with problems from the outset and          mortally weakened by the rigors of the return journey, Scott and his companions          perished.
The South Pole was not visited again until 31 October 1956.
On that          date, a ski-equipped R-4D aircraft landed at the Pole.
On board were Admiral          George Dufek and several other personnel of the United States Navy.
Their          purpose was to survey the site in preparation for the establishment of          a research station, one of many planned for the International Geophysical          Year (IGY).
Construction of the original South Pole Station began the          following month and by February 1957, the station was complete.
An eighteen-man          Navy support and civilian scientific crew, led by John Tuck and Paul Siple          remained for the winter, the first of the winter-over parties which have          continuously occupied what became know as Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.
The original station was modified and expended over the years, but by          1967 it was becoming increasingly apparent that a new station would be          needed.
Construction of the new South Pole Station began during the 1970-71          austral summer.
Erection of the dome, arches and interior modules took          place over the next three summers.
Finishing work was concluded during          the 1974-75 season, and in January 1975, the station was formally dedicated.
The old station was abandoned, and winter operations commenced at the          new facility the following month.
The South Pole Station is situated at 90 degrees South on the Polar          Plateau.
The station was originally constructed 400 meters from the geographic          South Pole; however, ice movement, at the rate of 10 meters per year,          will eventually carry the station over the actual Pole.
The site is at an elevation of approximately 2850 meters (9300 ft),          most of which is measured in ice thickness.
The very low atmospheric temperatures          produce an effective average pressure altitude of approximately 3230 meters          (10,600 ft).
The mean annual temperature is -49.3 degrees C (-56.7 F).
The lowest recorded temperature is -82.8 degrees C (-117.0 F) and the          highest temperature is -13.6 C (+7.5 F).
An extremely arid environment limits annual snowfall; however, a relatively          constant wind speed of 5-15 knots compounds the accumulation and accounts          for the heavy snow drifting common to inland antarctic stations.
The surrounding          terrain is completely flat, featureless snow.
STATION FACILITIES
The central area of the station is located beneath an aluminum geodesic          dome, 50 meters (165 ft) in diameter at the base and approximately 17          meters high (55 ft) at its apex.
The dome houses three two-story structures          which contain living, dining, communications, recreation, laboratory,          and meeting facilities.
The station can accommodate a crew of 27 during          the winter period and a crew of up to 27 during the summer in the dome          itself, with additional people accommodated in Summer Camp 150 meters          (500 ft) grid southwest of the station which is also the emergency facility          for the winter crew.
A series of steel arches run perpendicular to the axis of the dome's          main entryway and houses the garage complex, gymnasium, carpenter shop,          power plant, biomedical facility, and main fuel storage.
The fuel arch          contains nine 25,000 gallon bladders, giving the station a maximum capacity          of 950,000 liters or 225,000 gallons of JP-8 fuel.
The four story Skylab          and the balloon inflation tower adjoin the main station and are accessible          through covered archways.
The Clean Air Facility for atmospheric chemistry          lies 100 meters upwind of the station.
Other research modules are located          at various distances from the station.
Primary station power is provided          by one of three 359 kW diesel generators.
Waste heat is utilized for station          heating via a glycol circulation system that conducts the heated coolant          through the various station structures.
Another glycol loop supplies heat          to the snow melter for the station's water supply.
These systems, as well          as water, sewage, phone, computer, and electric lines are routed through          a series of sub-surface steel utility corridors, called utilidors.
STATION MISSION
The purpose of the South Pole Station is to provide a year-round facility          for scientific projects.
Current on-going programs include:
The upper atmospheric physics program which includes auroral observations,            magnetospheric and ionospheric studies, dynamics of the mesosphere and            lower thermosphere, and the study of cosmic ray intensity variations            which are caused by solar activity.
South Pole is one of the best equipped            upper atmosphere observatories on Earth, housing 10 entirely different            projects, several of which consist of more than one experiment;
Astrophysics which include solar astronomy, neutrino and gamma ray            astronomy and cosmology;
Meteorology;
Atmospheric studies which include a Clear Air Facility (CAF) for            the monitoring of minor gas species which are important in global climatic            change (e.g. ozone and carbon dioxide) and the sampling of airborne            particulates.
The South Pole CAF is one of NOAA's four baseline Clean            Air Facilities which are operated by the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics            Laboratory (CMDL).
The others are in Alaska, Hawaii, and American Samoa.
The site is, of course, central for the studies on the "Antarctic Ozone            Hole."
SAFETY
Safety is of utmost concern at South Pole Station.
All personnel should          be aware of all safety measures practiced including "off limits" areas          throughout the station.

WATER
Water for the main station is produced in a large snow melter filled          by a front-end loader.
Enough water is available for everyone's use.
However,          strict water discipline must be practiced, especially during summer peak          population periods.
During times of normal operations, showers should          be taken no more than twice a week.
Showers are not to exceed two minutes          use of running water.
Water faucets must not be left running while you          are washing hands or brushing teeth.
You will be expected to practice          water conservation throughout your stay at South Pole.
LAUNDRY
Washers and dryers are available.
Only one load of laundry per person          per week is allowed under normal circumstances.
To conserve water, washers          should be operated only with a full load.

      <H3>HISTORY</H3>
      <P> Attainment of the geographic South Pole was a primary concern of early 
        20th century explorers. Tentative forays into the antarctic region had 
        been undertaken by several expeditions during the 19th century, but it 
        was not until the early 1900s that the Pole itself was considered to be 
        a realistic goal. 
      <P> Two British expeditions, the "Discovery" expedition of 1902 and the 
        "Nimrod" expedition of 1908, were the first to depart for the continent 
        with conquest of the Pole an expressed purpose. Robert F. Scott's "Discovery" 
        expedition established an initial "furthest south" record, but competing 
        expedition priorities prevented further progress. In 1908, Ernest Shackleton, 
        a member of Scott's "furthest south" party, returned to the Antarctic 
        as leader of the "Nimrod" expedition. In a remarkable feat of endurance, 
        Shackleton and several others came to within 97 miles of the Pole before 
        returning to their base at McMurdo Sound and an eventual hero's welcome 
        in England. 
      <P> Victory, it seemed, would come to the next expedition. Such, in fact, 
        proved to be the case, but it came to a Norwegian expedition, led by the 
        ascetic Roald Amundsen. Amundsen, perhaps the ultimate polar technician, 
        had developed an interest in reaching the South Pole concurrent with the 
        formation of Robert Scott's second or "Terra Nova" expedition. When Scott 
        sailed for the Antarctic, Amundsen was not far behind and by intent or 
        coincidence, a race began. 
      <P> The race ended on 14 December 1911, when Amundsen and four others arrived 
        at the South Pole after a generally uneventful and carefully managed overland 
        journey. Their return was equally uneventful. 
      <P> Amundsen's almost lighthearted success contrasted starkly with the fate 
        of the Scott party. Scott and four companions reach the Pole a month after 
        Amundsen, on 17 January 1912. Beset with problems from the outset and 
        mortally weakened by the rigors of the return journey, Scott and his companions 
        perished. 
      <P> The South Pole was not visited again until 31 October 1956. On that 
        date, a ski-equipped R-4D aircraft landed at the Pole. On board were Admiral 
        George Dufek and several other personnel of the United States Navy. Their 
        purpose was to survey the site in preparation for the establishment of 
        a research station, one of many planned for the International Geophysical 
        Year (IGY). Construction of the original South Pole Station began the 
        following month and by February 1957, the station was complete. An eighteen-man 
        Navy support and civilian scientific crew, led by John Tuck and Paul Siple 
        remained for the winter, the first of the winter-over parties which have 
        continuously occupied what became know as Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. 
      <P> The original station was modified and expended over the years, but by 
        1967 it was becoming increasingly apparent that a new station would be 
        needed. Construction of the new South Pole Station began during the 1970-71 
        austral summer. Erection of the dome, arches and interior modules took 
        place over the next three summers. Finishing work was concluded during 
        the 1974-75 season, and in January 1975, the station was formally dedicated. 
        The old station was abandoned, and winter operations commenced at the 
        new facility the following month. 
      <P> The South Pole Station is situated at 90 degrees South on the Polar 
        Plateau. The station was originally constructed 400 meters from the geographic 
        South Pole; however, ice movement, at the rate of 10 meters per year, 
        will eventually carry the station over the actual Pole. 
      <P> The site is at an elevation of approximately 2850 meters (9300 ft), 
        most of which is measured in ice thickness. The very low atmospheric temperatures 
        produce an effective average pressure altitude of approximately 3230 meters 
        (10,600 ft). The mean annual temperature is -49.3 degrees C (-56.7 F). 
        The lowest recorded temperature is -82.8 degrees C (-117.0 F) and the 
        highest temperature is -13.6 C (+7.5 F). 
      <P> An extremely arid environment limits annual snowfall; however, a relatively 
        constant wind speed of 5-15 knots compounds the accumulation and accounts 
        for the heavy snow drifting common to inland antarctic stations. The surrounding 
        terrain is completely flat, featureless snow. 
      <P> 
      <H3>STATION FACILITIES</H3>
      <P> The central area of the station is located beneath an aluminum geodesic 
        dome, 50 meters (165 ft) in diameter at the base and approximately 17 
        meters high (55 ft) at its apex. The dome houses three two-story structures 
        which contain living, dining, communications, recreation, laboratory, 
        and meeting facilities. The station can accommodate a crew of 27 during 
        the winter period and a crew of up to 27 during the summer in the dome 
        itself, with additional people accommodated in Summer Camp 150 meters 
        (500 ft) grid southwest of the station which is also the emergency facility 
        for the winter crew. 
      <P> A series of steel arches run perpendicular to the axis of the dome's 
        main entryway and houses the garage complex, gymnasium, carpenter shop, 
        power plant, biomedical facility, and main fuel storage. The fuel arch 
        contains nine 25,000 gallon bladders, giving the station a maximum capacity 
        of 950,000 liters or 225,000 gallons of JP-8 fuel. The four story Skylab 
        and the balloon inflation tower adjoin the main station and are accessible 
        through covered archways. The Clean Air Facility for atmospheric chemistry 
        lies 100 meters upwind of the station. Other research modules are located 
        at various distances from the station. Primary station power is provided 
        by one of three 359 kW diesel generators. Waste heat is utilized for station 
        heating via a glycol circulation system that conducts the heated coolant 
        through the various station structures. Another glycol loop supplies heat 
        to the snow melter for the station's water supply. These systems, as well 
        as water, sewage, phone, computer, and electric lines are routed through 
        a series of sub-surface steel utility corridors, called utilidors. 
      <P> 
      <H3>STATION MISSION</H3>
      <P> The purpose of the South Pole Station is to provide a year-round facility 
        for scientific projects. Current on-going programs include: 
      <P> 
      <OL>
        <LI> The upper atmospheric physics program which includes auroral observations, 
          magnetospheric and ionospheric studies, dynamics of the mesosphere and 
          lower thermosphere, and the study of cosmic ray intensity variations 
          which are caused by solar activity. South Pole is one of the best equipped 
          upper atmosphere observatories on Earth, housing 10 entirely different 
          projects, several of which consist of more than one experiment; 
          <P> 
        <LI> Astrophysics which include solar astronomy, neutrino and gamma ray 
          astronomy and cosmology; 
          <P> 
        <LI> Meteorology; 
          <P> 
        <LI> Atmospheric studies which include a Clear Air Facility (CAF) for 
          the monitoring of minor gas species which are important in global climatic 
          change (e.g. ozone and carbon dioxide) and the sampling of airborne 
          particulates. The South Pole CAF is one of NOAA's four baseline Clean 
          Air Facilities which are operated by the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics 
          Laboratory (CMDL). The others are in Alaska, Hawaii, and American Samoa. 
          The site is, of course, central for the studies on the "Antarctic Ozone 
          Hole." 
      </OL>
      <P> 
      <H3> SAFETY</H3>
      <P> Safety is of utmost concern at South Pole Station. All personnel should 
        be aware of all safety measures practiced including "off limits" areas 
        throughout the station. Particular emphasis is given in and around all 
        work environments. Emergency response procedures are provided to all personnel 
        on station. Each person is required to know these procedures. Make note 
        of all exits throughout the facilities. Be aware of extinguisher placement 
        and usage. Please report observed hazards to the Station Manager. Remember, 
        prevention is of highest priority to ensure a safe living and working 
        environment. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> ENVIRONMENT</H3>
      <P> All personnel at South Pole Station are responsible to know and follow 
        the proper procedures for the disposal of waste products. All waste will 
        be separated for retrograde in accordance with established procedures. 
        Information regarding the separation of waste will be made available at 
        South Pole Station. 
      <P> An awareness of issues concerning environmental impact and acceptable 
        practices is crucial to the preservation of the pristine antarctic environment. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> BERTHING</H3>
      <P> Berthing space at South Pole Station is very limited. Your berthing 
        assignment, either under the dome or in the summer camp, will be given 
        to you by a station representative upon your arrival. 
      <P> If you are assigned to the summer camp, please be considerate of people 
        sleeping in your Jamesway. Lavatory facilities are available. Personnel 
        assigned to the summer camp should use the shower and laundry there. Linen 
        for both the main station and the summer camp will be distributed by station 
        personnel. You are requested to turn in your linen before departing. 
      <P> 
      <H3> MEALS</H3>
      <P> Meal schedules will be posted in the dining area. Normally, everyone 
        can be accommodated in the main station dining area, however, seating 
        - particularly during lunch and dinner - is limited. During meal time, 
        please eat promptly and vacate your seat if others are waiting. Please 
        clean your table when leaving and dispose of all trash and deposit silverware 
        and plates in the appropriate place. It takes effort by everyone to keep 
        the dining room clean and sanitary with an enjoyable dining atmosphere. 
        The cooks make every effort to provide the best meals possible. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> HOUSEKEEPING</H3>
      <P> Everyone on station is requested to assist in keeping the station clean. 
        Please help by keeping your own living and working areas neat and clean. 
        Items you wish to discard, including boxes, should be placed in the appropriate 
        bin located inside the dome. If you wish to save boxes, please ask about 
        appropriate storage areas where they should be neatly stacked. Your living 
        and working areas are your own responsibility. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> "HOUSE MOUSE"</H3>
      <P> You may be asked to participate in "house mouse" duties on Sundays during 
        your stay. These duties, which primarily consist of cleaning up the dining 
        hall or other common use areas, are rotated among the entire station population. 
        The "house mouse" schedule will be posted in the dining area. If your 
        scheduled duty and your scientific duties conflict, special arrangements 
        can be made. Any changes to the schedule should be discussed with the 
        Station Science Leader or the Station Manager. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> RECREATION</H3>
      <P> Recreation facilities include a game room, a library, a small gymnasium, 
        a weight-lifting room, and a bar. Video tapes may be borrowed from the 
        station store for use on the VCRs on station. After dining hours, the 
        dining hall may be used for table games. 
      <P> 
      <H3> STATION STORE</H3>
      <P> A station store is available to serve the personal needs of individuals 
        assigned to the station. It is stocked with sundries (toiletries and tobacco), 
        tourist items, postage stamps, and nonalcoholic and alcoholic beverages. 
        Items are in very limited supply, and you are cautioned not to be dependent 
        on the station store for any items other than beverages. The station store 
        also lends Beta and VHS format video movies. Station store operating hours 
        will be posted. 
      <P> The station store will not handle purchases of special items from the 
        Navy Exchange at McMurdo. All such transactions will be between the Navy 
        Exchange and the individual concerned. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> MAIL</H3>
      <P>Incoming mail is sorted and distributed as soon as it arrives. Outgoing 
        mail may be left in the mail bag hanging outside the station store. If 
        you wish to mail parcels, consult the Postmaster for information on postage, 
        insurance, and customs. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> MEDICAL CARE</H3>
      <P> Medical care is available year-round. An appointment with the Station 
        Physician should be made for routine problems. There is no dentist at 
        South Pole, but the Physician can advise you on proper course of action 
        for dental problems. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3>WATER</H3>
      <P> Water for the main station is produced in a large snow melter filled 
        by a front-end loader. Enough water is available for everyone's use. However, 
        strict water discipline must be practiced, especially during summer peak 
        population periods. During times of normal operations, showers should 
        be taken no more than twice a week. Showers are not to exceed two minutes 
        use of running water. Water faucets must not be left running while you 
        are washing hands or brushing teeth. You will be expected to practice 
        water conservation throughout your stay at South Pole. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3>LAUNDRY</H3>
      <P> Washers and dryers are available. Only one load of laundry per person 
        per week is allowed under normal circumstances. To conserve water, washers 
        should be operated only with a full load. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> VEHICLE USE</H3>
      <P> Vehicles available are tracked personnel carriers, Caterpillar 955 and 
        953 forklifts, and Caterpillar D-6 and D-7 Dozers. Scientific programs 
        requiring vehicles should contact the O&M Coordinator. Since there are 
        heavy demands on the small vehicle fleet, vehicle use will not be authorized 
        for recreational or non-official use. The Sprytes are equipped with radios. 
        Turn the radio on and conduct a check with communications when departing 
        the station. All vehicles left outside must be kept running or be plugged 
        into the proper electrical system. 
      <P> You must be checked out and approved to operate each type of vehicle. 
        This is an annual requirement. The ASA O&M Coordinator or Heavy Equipment 
        Mechanic will instruct you on how to use the vehicles. Make it a practice 
        to check fuel, anti-freeze, and engine oil levels, and always consult 
        the proper authority when adding such substances. Supplies are available 
        in the garage. Be sure the engine is warm before use. The Sprytes are 
        equipped with radios. Turn the radio on and conduct a check with communications 
        when departing the station. All vehicles left outside must be kept running 
        or be plugged in to the proper electrical system. 
      <P> Please report any defects, however slight, to the O&M Coordinator or 
        Heavy Equipment Mechanic when returning the vehicle. Maintenance at an 
        early stage keeps the vehicles from undergoing costly, time-consuming, 
        and major repairs. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3>FIRE</H3>
      <P> South Pole Station has designated fire teams specifically trained to 
        respond to emergencies at the station. If you hear an alarm, report to 
        the designated muster areas immediately, assisting fire teams only if 
        requested to do so. 
      <P> The danger of fire is always present and is always great. Be careful 
        about smoking and smoke only in permitted areas. Do not smoke in bed! 
        Check the ashtrays and waste baskets before leaving common-use areas for 
        the night. Cigarettes are to be extinguished completely, only in ashtrays. 
        Heat regulation throughout the facilities should be done by those individuals 
        instructed in such procedures. If you see a fire, try to extinguish it 
        quickly. Dry chemical, CO2, or water extinguishers are available inside 
        each building. If you are not familiar with the operation of these extinguishers 
        be sure to request instruction on their use. Sound the alarm by pulling 
        one of the fire alarm boxes. If you hear a fire alarm, report immediately 
        to the muster area so that you can be accounted for. Your assistance in 
        fighting the fire will be requested only if needed. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES</H3>
      <P> Even with the best of safety precautions, accidents and injuries may 
        occur. Use common sense in providing first aid or moving an injured person. 
        After your initial action to assist the individual involved, report the 
        accident, no matter how slight, to the Physician and the Station Manager. 
        The Station Manager will coordinate documentation and reporting of accidents 
        and injuries. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> COMMUNICATIONS</H3>
      <P> Communications systems of various types are available. If you wish to 
        utilize electronic mail, contact the Station Manager, the Station Science 
        Leader, or the Information Systems Coordinator for guidance. Sideband 
        (voice) communications with the NSF Representative or the Senior ASA Manager 
        at McMurdo may be made by coordinating with the Station Manager. HAM patches 
        may be made by signing up on the list located outside the HAM shack in 
        the communications building. Telephone calls utilizing the ATS-3 satellite 
        system may be made on Sundays and Mondays when official business matters 
        are complete. This service is a privilege which will be terminated if 
        abused. A sign up list for these services is posted in the Communications 
        Center. Handheld radios are available in the Communications Facility if 
        required. Please do not loiter in the communications building if you do 
        not have official business there. Communications personnel are usually 
        busy with airplane operations and message rely traffic. Report any problems 
        with any of the equipment to the Information Systems Coordinator. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> RESTRICTED AREAS</H3>
      <P> Certain station areas are restricted, either for your own safety or 
        for the sake of efficient science. If you wish to enter the instrument 
        areas grid north of the station, please do not disturb the sensors or 
        move upwind of them without consulting the Science Support Coordinator. 
        The power plant, fuel arch, antenna field, and garage should not be entered 
        without good reason. If you intend to travel more then 2,000 feet from 
        the station, advise the communications operator on duty of your departure 
        and make sure you have appropriate clothing. This is for your own safety. 
        No one will be allowed on the skiway one-half hour prior to the arrival 
        of all air traffic. Flight schedule information is made available by the 
        Communications Operator. Remember, weather conditions in the antarctic 
        can change unexpectedly. Handheld radios are available from the communications 
        staff. Wherever possible, distant travel should be in pairs using the 
        buddy system for maximum safety. The Old Pole Station area is unsafe and 
        has been declared strictly OFF LIMITS. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3>TELEPHONE</H3>
      <P> The station telephone system connects most station facilities. A directory 
        is posted by each telephone. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> WORK SPACE</H3>
      <P> Work spaces are limited. Those spaces that have not been allocated to 
        specific projects will be assigned on a first-come, first- serve basis. 
        If you require more space, consult the Science Support Coordinator. Work 
        facilities such as shelves, tables, and benches may be available, but 
        resourcefulness is encouraged. All non-authorized personnel requiring 
        the use of trade work areas, i.e., the garage or carpenter shop, must 
        do so only with the supervision of those responsible for each work shop. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3>SUPPLIES</H3>
      <P> If you need general supplies, consult the Supervisor, Logistics, who 
        may be able to save you the trouble of requesting items from your institution. 
        Electronic and scientific supplies may be available through the Science 
        Support Coordinator. Please do not take items off the shelves without 
        first asking the materials personnel, as all materials are inventoried. 
        Inadvertent use of project-specific materials can have devastating effects 
        on those projects. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3>CARGO</H3>
      <P> Cargo movements and inventories are managed by the Supervisor, Logistics. 
        To inquire about the status of your cargo or to request support requirements 
        consult this person. Science personnel can also contact the Science Coordinator 
        for these types of assistance. If you require to send cargo to the United 
        States (retrograde), advise materials personnel promptly. They will advise 
        you of proper documentation to be completed and packaging requirements 
        to ensure that your cargo is shipped. 
      <P> The Supervisor, Logistics, controls cargo and supplies. If you want 
        to know about your cargo, see this person. Science personnel can also 
        contact the Science Coordinator for cargo information. If you need to 
        send things to the United States (retrograde), advise materials personnel 
        promptly. They will advise you of packing and marking requirements and 
        ensure that your cargo is shipped. 
      <P> You are cautioned to prepare retrograde cargo as early as possible since 
        the cargo ship leaves McMurdo the end of January. Air cargo space is very 
        limited, thus permission and prioritization from the NSF Representative, 
        Antarctica, for all air shipments back to the United States will be necessary. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3> COMPUTER FACILITIES</H3>
      <P> Two DEC VAX computer systems are available for data acquisition and 
        on-site reduction and analysis. Several general-purpose PCs are also available, 
        as well as a Sun Unix Workstation. Personnel from Antarctic Support Associates 
        operate and service these general- purpose systems and help scientists 
        program and interface their experiments to the systems. Consult the Computer 
        Technician or Science Support Coordinator for information concerning computer 
        capabilities and availability if you have a need. 
      <P> 
      <P> 
      <H3>REDEPLOYMENT</H3>
      <P> When you arrive at McMurdo Station on your way to the South Pole, the 
        Administrative Coordinator at the NSF Chalet will request you provide 
        the dates on which you wish to redeploy to Christchurch, New Zealand, 
        and to the United States. Confirmation or revision to plans should be 
        provided to the South Pole Station Manager at least two weeks in advance 
        of departure so that the Chalet may be informed and your departure scheduled. 
      <P> It is good practice to advise the Station Administrative Coordinator 
        as early as possible of your departure date from South Pole. Note, however, 
        that flights are never scheduled more than four days in advance. During 
        the austral summer there are usually several flights weekly to the South 
        Pole, providing ample opportunities for your departure. Because of the 
        nature of antarctic operations, flights are subject to various delays. 
        Decisions to fly are often given on very short notice and flight times 
        may be advanced or delayed several hours. In general, when a flight for 
        South Pole departs from McMurdo, its Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) is 
        announced over the South Pole Intercom. This provides about three hours 
        before arrival at South Pole. The Station Administrative Coordinator will 
        provide the point-of- contact for passenger movement from South Pole Station. 
      <P> When your plane arrives, be ready to board as soon as cargo off- load 
        is complete, and the loadmaster gives the okay. The airplane does not 
        wait for passengers. Please be very careful in boarding as the engines 
        normally will remain running during ground operations. Approach the aircraft 
        only from the nose or tail direction (not parallel to the wings and engines) 
        and only when directed by the air crew or ground personnel. 
      <P>

Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen was the first person to reach the South Pole, on 14 December 1911. He led the first expedition to reach the geographic South Pole five weeks ahead of a British party led by Robert Falcon Scott.
Amundsen’s plans had originally focused on the Arctic and the conquest of the North Pole, but the expedition was suspended in 1909 when he learned that the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary both claimed to have reached the North Pole.
In June 1910 Amundsen decided to reroute and instead sailed for Antarctica with the aim of reaching the South Pole, where the English explorer Robert F. Scott was also headed. Nearly six months later, the expedition arrived at a large inlet called the Bay of the Whales, where Amundsen established his base camp.
In October the team set off using sledges and dogs. On 14 December 1911 the expedition team arrived at the Pole and returned safely to base camp in late January. Amundsen won the race and preceded Scott’s expedition by over a month. On his return journey, Scott and his companions faced particularly harsh conditions and perished due to exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold.
Amundsen later made attempts to become the first explorer to fly over the North Pole but fell short of his goal and was apparently preceded by American explorer Richard E. Byrd, although these claims have been recently questioned.
In 1928, Amundsen disappeared during a rescue mission in the Arctic and the bodies were never recovered.

Background Info
Vocabulary
On December 14, 1911, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen became the first person to reach the South Pole .
Amundsen and his team arrived at the pole five weeks ahead of their rival, British explorer Robert Falcon Scott.
(Perhaps more importantly, Amundsen and his team returned from their journey , while Scott’s expedition perished.)
The South Pole was one of the last terrestrial locations explored on Earth, and Antarctica remains a difficult place to visit today.
Temperatures can drop as low as -80 degrees Celsius (-112 °Fahrenheit) in the winter.
Ice covers 98% of the continent , and is more than a kilometer deep.
Once explorers like Amundsen conquered the South Pole, scientists moved in.
The unique isolation of Antarctica makes it important for studying Earth at its extremes.
About 5,000 researchers work in Antarctica, studying climate , glaciers, biodiversity , astronomy , and even paleontology in the most extreme part of the planet .

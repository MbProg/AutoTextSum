The first venture to the South Pole was led by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen.
Originally planning to set sail for the Arctic, Amundsen learned that American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary had already made their way to the North Pole in 1909.
Switching his sights to the Antarctic, he and his crew departed from Oslo on June 3, 1910 on their ship Fram.
On Jan. 14, 1910, Amundsen reached the Bay of Whales, setting up a camp that he referred to as Framheim.
After a first failed attempt to make their way inland, they embarked for the South Pole again in October of 1911, finally reaching their destination on Dec. 14, 1911, just about five weeks ahead of a British team led by Robert F. Scott.
They placed a Norwegian flag, a tent, and note to mark their accomplishment.
Amundsen survived the journey back to Framheim (Scott and his party died on their return) and went on to explore much of the Arctic and even flew over the North Pole in 1926.
Below are several spectacular photos from Amundsen and his crew's journey to the South Pole, courtesy of The Public Domain Review  and Wikimedia , showing how the crew kept busy along their journey and what they saw on their voyage to Antarctica.

                    Amundsen, born in 1872 near Oslo, Norway, left his mark on 
                    the Heroic Era as one of the most successful polar explorers 
                    ever born. His career of adventure began at the age of 15, 
                    originally studying medicine, but dropping out to go to sea 
                    where he soon moved his way up to the rank of mate. His first 
                    experience in the Antarctic was with <a href="p0000083.htm" target="_blank">Adrien 
                    de Gerlache</a>'s 1899 <i><b>BELGICA EXPEDITION</b></i>. He 
                    became the first to travel the Northwest Passage, in his ship 
                    <i>Gjoa</i> in 1903-06. After this expedition, plans were 
                    assembled to drift across the North Pole in Nansen's famous 
                    <i><b>FRAM</b></i>, but news arrived of <a href="aspp017.htm" target="_blank">Peary's</a> 
                    successful attainment of the pole which caused Amundsen to 
                    make new plans--<i>covert</i> plans--for an expedition to 
                    the Antarctic and the subsequent capture of the South Pole. 
                    On December 14, 1911, Amundsen and four others stood at the 
                    South Pole, a month before <a href="p0000089.htm" target="_blank">Robert 
                    Scott</a>. This expedition was an incredible masterpiece of 
                    organization. Here is the story... </font></td>

      <p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The 
        North Pole is reached!" was the news that flashed all over the world...it 
        was September 1909 when the news reached Amundsen. The original plan of 
        the <i><b>FRAM'S</b></i> third voyage--the exploration of the North Polar 
        basin--was quickly called off. In order to save the expedition, Amundsen 
        immediately turned his attention to the South simultaneously emphasizing 
        to his financial contributors that the <i><b>FRAM'S</b></i> Arctic voyage 
        would be, in every way, a scientific expedition and would have nothing 
        to do with record-breaking. Therefore, as far as the supporters were aware, 
        Amundsen's Arctic voyage would not be influenced one way or another by 
        Peary's accomplishment. Since he was so heavily in debt, Amundsen felt 
        his change in plans to head south and capture the South Pole should be 
        kept a secret. In his own words, Amundsen wrote, "I know that I have been 
        reproached for not having at once made the extended plan public, so that 
        not only my supporters, but the explorers who were preparing to visit 
        the same regions might have knowledge of it. I was well aware that these 
        reproaches would come, and had therefore carefully weighed this side of 
        the matter". As hinted at, he also felt it important to keep his intentions 
        secret from his peers. "Nor did I feel any great scruples with regard 
        to the other Antarctic expeditions that were being planned at the time. 
        I knew I should be able to inform Captain Scott of the extension of my 
        plans before he left civilization, and therefore a few months sooner or 
        later could be of no great importance. Scott's plan and equipment were 
        so widely different from my own that I regarded the telegram that I sent 
        him later, with the information that we were bound for the Antarctic regions, 
        rather as a mark of courtesy than as a communication which might cause 
        him to alter his programme in the slightest degree. The British expedition 
        was designed entirely for scientific research. The Pole was only a side-issue, 
        whereas in my extended plan it was the main object". Amundsen must have 
        been in a dream world as this simply was not true. Scott's intention to 
        try for the Pole had been widely publicized and was certainly not a <i>side 
        issue</i>...one only need turn to Scott's Antarctic Expedition announcement 
        in the September 13, 1909, issue of <i>The Times</i> of London.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amundsen 
        admitted that he was heavily in debt and knew that his best chance of 
        raising money was to bring off a spectacular triumph. Amundsen wrote, 
        "If at that juncture I had made my intention public, it would only have 
        given occasion for a lot of newspaper discussion, and possibly have ended 
        in the project being stifled at its birth. Everything had to be got ready 
        quietly and calmly. My brother, upon whose absolute silence I could blindly 
        rely, was the only person I let into the secret of my change of plan, 
        and he did me many important services during the time when we alone shared 
        the knowledge". The only other man to know of the change in plans was 
        the ship's commander, Lieutenant Thorvald Nilsen. Amundsen kept his plans 
        so secret that only these two men, along with Lieutenants Prestrud and 
        Gjertsen (told on the eve of the <i><b>FRAM'S</b></i> departure), knew 
        of them before the <i><b>FRAM</b></i> reached Madeira, ostensibly on the 
        way to Buenos Aires and then northwards to the Arctic; the Madeira trip 
        was supposed to be mainly for the purpose of oceanographical research.</font></p>

          <td width="77%" valign="middle"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            Norwegians left Christiania on August 9, 1910, eight weeks after Scott's 
            <i><b>TERRA NOVA EXPEDITION</b></i> had departed Cardiff. On board 
            were 97 Greenland dogs, the key to Amundsen's success, along with 
            a hut and provisions for two years in the Antarctic. A month later, 
            on September 6, the <i><b>FRAM</b></i> arrived at Madeira where fresh 
            water and other provisions were taken on board. A few minor repairs 
            were made to the ship as the crew enjoyed some free time ashore. On 
            the evening of the 9th, some three hours before departing for Antarctica, 
            Amundsen called the crew to his attention. Many of the men were quite 
            puzzled and unhappy to be interrupted as they were quickly writing 
            final letters for home. As they came on deck, Amundsen was standing 
            next to a map of Antarctica pinned to the mainmast. Amundsen spoke, 
            "...it is my intention to sail Southwards, land a party on the Southern 
            continent and try to reach the South Pole". Gjertsen wrote, "Most 
            stood there with mouths agape staring at the Chief like so many question 
            marks". Amundsen personally asked each man if he would like to join 
            him on this historic journey. The last man to go ashore was Amundsen's 
            brother, Leon. His charge would be to mail the men's letters and cable 
            Scott...but not until the beginning of October when Amundsen knew 
            he would be beyond the point of recall. Once Amundsen left Madeira, 
            he vanished, bound for an unknown destination...Scott never dreamt 
            it would be the Ross Sea. Scott, on board the <i><b>TERRA NOVA</b></i>, 
            arrived in Melbourne on the evening of October 12, 1910. Among the 
            mail waiting for him was Amundsen's telegram, sent from Madeira, which 
            came as a complete surprise: "Beg leave inform you proceeding Antarctic. 
            Amundsen." Although there is no record of Scott's reaction, Evans 
            later recalled, "we considered that he [Amundsen] would go to the 
            Pole from the Weddell Sea side". In London, Sir Clements Markham eagerly 
            put forth his opinion: "She [the <i><b>FRAM</b></i>] has no more sailing 
            qualities than a haystack. In any case, Scott will be on the ground 
            and settled long before Amundsen turns up, if he ever does". Markham 
            gleaned information from his sources in Norway and reported to the 
            Royal Geographic Society's secretary, on October 15, that Amundsen 
            had "quietly got a wintering hut made on board and 100 dogs and a 
            supply of tents and sledges. His secret design must have been nearly 
            a year old. They believe his mention of Punta Aranas and Buenos Aires 
            is merely a blind, and that he is going to McMurdo Sound to try to 
            cut out Scott...If I were Scott I would not let them land, but he 
            is always too good-natured". Whatever the rights and wrongs of the 
            matter, the general view among those involved in Scott's expedition 
            was that Amundsen's behavior was underhanded.</font></td>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It took the <i><b>FRAM</b></i> 
        four months to reach the Ross Ice Shelf, on January 14, 1911. Amundsen 
        chose the Bay of Whales as winter headquarters for a number of reasons. 
        First, they could sail a whole degree farther south than Scott could hope 
        to get in McMurdo Sound, putting them 60 miles closer to the Pole; secondly, 
        they could set up their headquarters right on top of their field of work; 
        thirdly, animal life in the Bay of Whales was extraordinarily rich and 
        offered all the fresh meat the men required in the form of seals, penguins, 
        etc. Besides, it offered a favorable site for an investigation of the 
        meteorological conditions in all directions and was very easy to reach 
        by ship. Unloading started on January 15 with camp established two miles 
        inland. The first sledge was loaded with supplies, hitched to eight dogs 
        and led away by Amundsen.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the next three 
        weeks, five sledges, 46 dogs and five men transferred some 10 tons of 
        supplies daily to base camp. Meanwhile, the carpenter, Jorgen Stubberud, 
        supervised the assembly of the prefabricated hut. After a visit from Scott's 
        <i><b>TERRA NOVA</b></i>, the base camp was christened Framheim--"The 
        home of Fram"--and the depot-laying journeys began. Within a three-week 
        period, depots were established at 80&deg;S, 81&deg;S and 82&deg;S...more 
        than a ton and a half of supplies had been stored within 480 miles of 
        the Pole. On April 21 the sun finally sank and the long winter night began.</font></p>

            great deal of work had to be done over the next four months. Amundsen 
            was well aware of potential problems brought by nine men cramped into 
            close quarters over the long winter nights so a strict routine was 
            quickly introduced. Six days a week the men would rise at 7:30 am, 
            have breakfast, start work at 9:00 and have lunch at noon. They would 
            return to their work at 2:00 pm and end at 5:15, with the balance 
            of the day to be used as they pleased. Each man took his turn as the 
            week's housekeeper emptying ashtrays, sweeping up and generally keeping 
            the hut clean. Each man had two hooks on which to hang clothes, while 
            the rest of their small stuff was kept out of sight in a clothes sack 
            nearby. In addition to the hut in which they lived, fifteen 16-man 
            tents were erected to store fuel and supplies. Bjaaland and Hassel 
            built a Scandanavian staple...a sauna. A bottomless box, on a platform 
            raised two feet off the ice floor, was built large enough to slip 
            over the man, allowing only his head to protrude. A tin box, fitted 
            between the platform and the ice floor, was heated by two paraffin 
            stoves. As the water boiled, the compartment would fill with steam. 
            When the man was finished, a rope-and-pulley system would lift the 
            box clear, exposing a naked man, who then had to make a dash back 
            to the hut. Exposure to the elements would quickly seal the pores...the 
            event became a Saturday night ritual. </font></td>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the winter, every 
        man had specific chores. Kristian Prestrud, assisted by Hjalmar Johansen, 
        made scientific observations; Sverre Hassel, assisted by Helmer Hanssen, 
        was nicknamed the "Managing Director of Framheim's Coal, Oil and Coke 
        Company Limited", the position responsible for supplying lamps and heaters 
        with fuel. Johansen packed the sledges with pemmican, chocolate, milk 
        powder and biscuits. Remodelling and overhauling of the expedition's sledging 
        equipment was left to the skilled carpenter, Olav Bjaaland, assisted by 
        Jorgen Stubberud. Bjaaland was an expert at reducing unnecessary weight 
        on the sledges. As well as preparing two sets of skis for each man, Bjaaland 
        lightened the weight of the sledges by nearly one third. Stubberud achieved 
        similar results with the sledging cases. When Bjaaland was finished, Hanssen 
        and Oscar Wisting would assemble the sledge using rawhide lashings. In 
        a tiny snow cave off the main storage room, Wisting spent most of the 
        winter at a sewing machine where new tents were made, complete with floors, 
        from weight-saving windcloth. The new tents weighed nearly nine pounds 
        less than the tents brought on the expedition. The camp's cook was an 
        overweight and jolly man named Adolf Lindstrom. Lindstrom would rise each 
        morning at 6:00 am to prepare a breakfast of hot buckwheat cakes spread 
        with whortleberry preserve, plus wholemeal bread enriched with wheatgerm, 
        butter and cheese. Amundsen said Lindstroms' cakes "slipped down with 
        fabulous rapidity". As for lunch, various meals were prepared from fresh 
        or frozen seal meat, supplemented with tinned meats by the end of winter. 
        For dessert, tinned California fruits, tarts, pudding, pies and pastries, 
        all made by Lindstrom, were served. Supper was seal steak, bread with 
        butter, whortleberry jam and cheese. Coffee was the staple beverage although 
        brandy was served on Saturday evenings, birthdays and holidays. Amundsen 
        made certain the food at Framheim was very nutritious since he'd learned 
        first-hand the effects of scurvy while on the <i><b>BELGICA EXPEDITION</b></i> 
        in 1897.</font></p>

            men actually enjoyed getting together each evening over supper. Since 
            they had worked in different parts of the camp during the day, rarely 
            was there a lack of conversation come evening time. Card games, dart 
            matches, reading and needlework took place often around the main table. 
            Occasionally the gramophone was brought out and a few records played. 
            But, despite the relative easy passing of winter nights, Amundsen 
            remained worried about Johansen's quick temper. Forced abstinence 
            from alcohol made Johansen quite difficult to deal with at times. 
            To make matters worse, Johansen had as much experience in polar exploration 
            as Amundsen; he had been to the Arctic with Nansen. Johansen felt 
            this put him, at worst, on level par with Amundsen. And then there 
            was the matter of Robert Scott...how far had the English advanced? 
            Amundsen was aware that Scott was using motorized sledges although 
            he doubted their efficiency. Little did he know of what was going 
            on at McMurdo Sound.</font></td>

            months would pass before the weather was warm enough for them to start 
            the journey to the Pole. Tensions increased as each day passed. Amundsen 
            would have the men and dogs prepared for departure only to cancel 
            at the last moment due to inclement weather. The weather had to be 
            clear for their first run to the 80&deg;S depot, or there was a real 
            risk of missing it. Finally, on Friday, September 8, 1911, they sped 
            off across the snow...eight men with sledges pulled by 86 dogs; only 
            Lindstrom was left behind as custodian of Framheim. Amundsen wrote 
            that "the going was splendid" and they covered 31 miles over the next 
            three days. However, on the morning of the 11th they awoke to frigid 
            temperatures nearing -70&deg;F. By the next day, conditions were even 
            worse as the fluid in their compasses froze solid. Amundsen determined 
            that it was simply too risky to continue on towards the Pole. That 
            evening a decision was made to make a run for the depot, weather permitting, 
            unload their sledges and race back to Framheim. The weather co-operated 
            and they arrived at the depot on Thursday. The next evening Hanssen 
            and Stubberud discovered their heels were frostbitten. As well, a 
            number of the dogs were suffering from the cold; two of the dogs froze 
            to death in their sleep. At 7:00 the next morning they set off for

            would normally keep in sight of each other but the first two sledges 
            moved so rapidly that the others were soon left behind. The sledge 
            teams continued to break up, with Bjaaland and Stubberud reaching 
            Framheim first at 6 pm, followed two hours later by Amundsen's group. 
            A half an hour after that Hassel arrived and six hours later, at 12:30 
            am, Johansen and Prestrud finally stumbled into camp. Johansen and 
            Prestrud were totally exhausted, having found Framheim in the dark 
            and fog only by following the barking of the dogs. At breakfast the 
            next morning, Amundsen finally succeeded in knocking the chip off 
            Johansen's shoulder when Amundsen asked why it had taken them so long 
            to make it back to Framheim. Johansen exploded, angrily accusing Amundsen 
            of panicking and displaying poor leadership qualities when the group 
            had been allowed to split up. In the dead silence that followed, Amundsen 
            remained speechless. It was what Amundsen had always feared--a confrontation 
            with the one man in the expedition with experience to equal his own. 
            This brought to an end the harmony amongst all the men as Amundsen 
            never forgave Johansen or spoke to him unless absolutely necessary. 
            Amundsen's excuse to the others was that Hanssen was suffering too 
            severely from frostbite to linger behind...the men were not totally 
            convinced.</font></td>

      <p align=left><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At noon, 
        Amundsen announced to his men a change in plans. Amundsen would lead one 
        party to the Pole while Prestrud--with Johansen--would lead a second party 
        to explore King Edward VII Land. Amundsen's decision was not a revengeful 
        one as he felt that if the Pole party were not successful, at least there 
        might still be a "first" gained for Norway. Amundsen then spoke to each 
        man individually (ignoring Johansen), asking for his pledge of loyalty...all 
        gave it. And so, on October 20, 1911, Amundsen, Bjaaland, Wisting, Hassel 
        and Hanssen departed on their historic journey to the Pole. Four sledges 
        were used, each pulled with 13 dogs. They made good progress, other than 
        a little trouble with crevasses, and arrived at 80&deg;S depot on the 
        24th. They uncovered the provisions and gave the dogs a feast of seal 
        meat and blubber. The next day the party left with all five men on skis. 
        On the way south, they spotted a cairn still standing as they had built 
        it the prior April. Thus proving reliability, another 150 similar cairns 
        were built on the journey south, each left with a written record inside 
        stating the distance and bearing to the next cairn. Each day, as they 
        built their cairn, lunch was eaten..."nothing very luxurious", wrote Amundsen, 
        "three or four dry oatmeal biscuits, that was all. If one wanted a drink, 
        one could mix snow with the biscuit". They arrived at 82&deg;S depot on 
        November 4. Two days later they left...they were accomplishing 20 miles 
        each day, in only five hours, after which they would build their cairn, 
        in an hour and a half, and then rest for the remainder of the day. On 
        November 11 the peaks of mountains were seen in the distance, which Amundsen 
        later named Queen Maud's Range, after the Queen of Norway. At the foot 
        of the range they camped and discussed strategy for the final push to 
        the Pole, some 340 miles distant. The final plan was to take supplies 
        and provisions for 30 days, along with the remaining 42 dogs, and make 
        the climb. After reaching the top, 24 of the dogs would be shot, since 
        they would no longer be needed, using the remaining 18 in the final dash 
        for the Pole. Once reached, six more would be slaughtered to provide food 
        for the remaining twelve on the trip back to Framheim. On November 17 
        they started the climb up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. The weather was warm 
        and the climb even better as they covered 11.5 miles before making camp 
        at 2000 feet. Four days later, on November 21, they found themselves at 
        the summit. They'd managed to carry a ton of supplies to an altitude of 
        10,000 feet. Twenty-four dogs were shot and the party stayed at "The Butcher's 
        Shop", as it was now called, for four more days before heading off into 
        a raging blizzard. They had already waited two days longer than planned 
        so they had no choice but to push on. For the next ten days they struggled, 
        five men and 18 dogs, against driving snow in 35 mph winds and thick fog. 
        At last they reached the plateau, only to be confronted by "The Devil's 
        Ballroom", a glacier with a thin crust of</font> snow covering a number 
        of dangerous, deep crevasses. This proved to be the last major obstacle.</p>

            farthest south, 88&deg;23'S. They were only 95 miles from the South 
            Pole. The dogs were hungry and exhausted, the men had many sores and 
            frostbitten faces, yet still the party pushed on. The closer they 
            came to the Pole, the more Amundsen worried that Scott had already 
            beaten them. The temptation to race on, at full speed, was shared 
            by everyone. At 3:00 pm, on Friday, December 14, 1911, there was a 
            simultaneous cry of "Halt!" as the sledge meters registered their 
            arrival at the South Pole. They had achieved their goal. Symbolic 
            of their struggle in unity, each of the men, with their weathered 
            and frostbitten hands, grasped the Norwegian flag and planted it firmly 
            at the geographical South Pole. Amundsen named the plain King Haakon 
            VII's Plateau. There were festivities in the tent that evening with 
            each man sharing a little seal meat. At midnight observations were 
            taken that put them at 89&deg; 56'S. Arrangements were now made to

        closer to the actual Pole, Hanssen and Bjaaland went out four geographical 
        miles and promptly returned. Bjaaland surprised Amundsen when he pulled 
        out a cigar-case full of cigars at dinner. A cigar at the Pole! Following 
        the festival dinner, preparations for departure began. A tent was erected, 
        naming it Poleheim, with Amundsen leaving a message inside for Scott, 
        along with a letter for King Haakon. Thirty-nine days later the party 
        returned to Framheim, as planned, with all five men and 11 dogs "hale 
        and hearty". The month-long voyage back to Tasmania was a frustrating 
        time for Amundsen, who was now quite anxious to be the first to announce 
        the news of their achievement. On March 7, 1912, Amundsen finally cabled 
        his brother Leon with the historic news.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During World War I 
        Amundsen made a significant amount of money from supplying "neutral" shipping. 
        He went on to build the <i><b>MAUD</b></i> in order to continue his Arctic 
        drift. He managed to complete the Northwest Passage around Siberia--only 
        the second to do so--but failed in his attempt to proceed farther north. 
        Subsequently, he left the ship in 1921. Amundsen now became consumed with 
        flying, but was soon facing extreme financial hardship before gaining 
        support from Lincoln Ellsworth. Together with Ellsworth, history was made 
        when they flew the airship <i><b>NORGE</b></i> from Spitsbergen to Alaska 
        via the North Pole. This was the first trans-Arctic flight right across 
        the Pole. Amundsen, fulfilled by his reputation, now retired. Unfortunately, 
        he never could come to terms with the British reaction to his secret change 
        of plans in 1910. Mill, of the Royal Geographic Society, described him

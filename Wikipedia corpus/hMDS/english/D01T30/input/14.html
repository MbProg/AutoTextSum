  <p><strong><font color="#C1C1A2" size="7" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">eflecting 
    life from a bygone era, Chaco Canyon&#8217;s stony ruins protrude from archaeological 
    excavations</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">, 
    back dropped by the wild beauty of sheer rock cliff walls, </font></strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> 
    and provide traces of a once thriving Anasazi culture dating back a thousand 
    years. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Situated in a high-desert landscape 
    dotted with sagebrush, cactus, and dry scrub forests of pi&ntilde;on and juniper, 
    Chaco Canyon is in the four-corners region of northwestern New Mexico between 
    Albuquerque and Farmington. It lays in the San Juan Basin, atop the vast Colorado 
    Plateau, surrounded by the Chuska Mountains in the west, the San Juan Mountains 
    to the north, and the San Pedro Mountains in the east. The canyon is oriented 
    in a northwest-to-southeast direction and is rimmed by mesas. Between AD 900 
    and 1150, Chaco Canyon was a major center of culture and commerce for the 
    ancient Pueblo Peoples.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The emergence of Chacoan culture, 
    which began in the mid 800s, lasted more than 300 years. The ruins reflect 
    the impressive scale of Chacoan architecture and reveal proof of its fine 
    stone work. Chacoan culture had a complex community life and a sophisticated 
    level of social organization. Chacoans were also engaged in a surprising degree 
    of far-reaching commerce. There is strong evidence of a turquoise processing 
    and trading industry dating from the 10th century. The Chacoans traded with 
    other cultures as far away as Mexico</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Archaeological studies indicate the 
    Chacoans were preceded in the canyon by hunter-gatherers, who were descendants 
    of nomadic Clovis hunters that arrived in the Southwest around 10,000 BC. 
    By approximately 900 BC, these people lived at sites in the canyon, such as 
    Atlatl Cave. By approximately AD 490, their descendants, known as Basketmakers, 
    were living in pithouse settlements and farming. The Basketmakers remained 
    in the Chaco Canyon area until around 800, during which time their dwellings 
    had evolved into crescent-shaped stone complexes, which were comprised of 
    four to five residential suites, adjoined subterranean kivas that were used 
    for religious observances and ceremonies. By 850 AD, this ancient Pueblo population, 
    known as the Anasazi or ancient ones, had rapidly expanded and were now living 
    in larger pueblos. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Chacoans quarried sandstone blocks 
    and hauled timber for construction from locations, such as the Chuska Mountains 
    over 50 miles to the west. They built fifteen major complexes, which were 
    the largest buildings in North America until the 19th century. Using masonry 
    techniques unique for their time, they constructed massive stone buildings 
    (Great Houses) of multiple stories, which contained hundreds of rooms. Great 
    Kivas placed nearby, created a symmetrical pattern common to many Chacoan 
    Great Houses. Construction on some of the buildings probably spanned decades 
    or even centuries. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The Chacoans built their complexes 
    along a nine-mile stretch of canyon floor. Their structures were surrounded 
    by sacred mountains, mesas, and shrines that still have deep spiritual meaning 
    for their descendants. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">During the middle and late 800s, the 
    great houses of Pueblo Bonito, Una Vida, and Pe&ntilde;asco Blanco were constructed, 
    followed by Hungo Pavi, Chetro Ketl, Pueblo Alto, and others. Lines of sight 
    between the great houses are thought to have been purposely designed to allow 
    communication between them. Pueblo Bonito, the largest of the Chacoan Great 
    Houses, stands at the foot of Chaco Canyon's northern rim. A structure four 
    stories high with at least 650 rooms, it was the largest Great House of its 
    time.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Most of the complexes in Chaco Canyon 
    averaged more than 200 rooms each and often stood four to five stories tall, 
    The Houses were generally oriented to face the south with adjacent plaza areas 
    and ceremonial kivas. The kivas had distinctive architectural features, including 
    T-shaped doorways and stone lintels.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">There is an indication that Chacoan 
    buildings were aligned to capture the solar and lunar cycles and their structures 
    were often oriented to solar and lunar directions. For example, a square of 
    light floods a notch in the wall of Casa Rinconada's Great Kiva on the summer 
    solstice, and locations marked within the Great Kiva are thought by some to 
    have created a simple stellar observatory.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">By 1050 AD, Chaco had become the ceremonial, 
    administrative, and economic center of the San Juan Basin. Its sphere of influence 
    was extensive. Dozens of great houses in Chaco Canyon were connected by roads 
    to more than 150 great houses throughout the region. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> 
    Four ancient Anasazi roads converge at Chaco Canyon.</font></strong></font> 
    <font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Contemporary Pueblo people say that Chaco was 
    a special gathering place where many peoples and clans converged to share 
    their ceremonies, traditions, and knowledge.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">In the 1100s and 1200s, change came 
    to Chaco and its role as a regional center shifted, but its influence continued 
    at the pueblos of Aztec, Mesa Verde, the Chuska Mountains, and other centers 
    to the north, south, and west. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Climate change is thought to have 
    led to the migration of Chacoans and the eventual abandonment of the canyon, 
    beginning with a 50-year drought in 1130 AD. Eventually, the inhabitants, 
    sealed up their storehouses, left their homes there and migrated north to 
    new areas. Archaeological and cultural evidence indicates the people from 
    the region migrated south, east, and west into the valleys and drainages of 
    the Little Colorado River, the Rio Puerco, and the Rio Grande.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The Chacoan sites are considered sacred 
    ancestral homelands of the Hopi and Pueblo people, who continue to maintain 
    oral traditions recounting their historical migration from Chaco and their 
    spiritual relationship to the land. Many Southwest Indian tribes look upon 
    Chaco as a spiritual place to be honored and respected, and consider it an 
    important part of their clans' sacred migration paths.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Numic-speaking peoples, such as the 
    Ute and Shoshone, inhabited the Colorado Plateau beginning in the 12th century. 
    Nomadic Southern Athabaskan speaking peoples, such as the Apache and Navajo, 
    who followed the Pueblo people in this region in the 15th century, acquired 
    Chacoan customs and agricultural skills. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The modern Navajo Nation lies west 
    of Chaco Canyon and many Navajo live in the surrounding areas. The arrival 
    of the Spanish in the 17th century inaugurated an era of subjugation and rebellion. 
    Subsequently, the Chaco Canyon area absorbed Puebloan and Navajo refugees, 
    who fled from the Spanish rule. In succession, as first Mexico, then the US, 
    gained sovereignty over the canyon, military campaigns were launched against 
    the region's remaining inhabitants.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">A trader, Josiah Gregg, wrote about 
    the ruins of Chaco Canyon in 1832. In 1849, a U.S. Army detachment passed 
    through the area and surveyed the ruins. The location was so remote, however, 
    that over the next 50 years the canyon was scarcely visited. After a brief 
    reconnaissance by Smithsonian scholars in the 1870s, formal archaeological 
    work began in 1896, when a party from the American Museum of Natural History 
    - the Hyde Exploring Expedition - began excavating Pueblo Bonito. They spent 
    five summers in the region, sent over 60,000 artifacts back to New York, and 
    operated a series of trading posts.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">In 1901 Richard Wetherill, who had 
    worked for the Hyde brothers during their expedition, claimed a homestead 
    of 161 acres of land in the area. While investigating Wetherill's land claim, 
    federal land agent Samuel J. Holsinger observed the physical setting of the 
    canyon and its sites, its prehistoric road segments, the stairways above Chetro 
    Ketl, and its prehistoric dams and irrigation systems. His report documented 
    these findings and strongly recommended the creation of a national park to 
    encompass and preserve Chacoan sites. The next year, Edgar Lee Hewett, who 
    was president of New Mexico Normal University, which later became New Mexico 
    Highlands University, mapped many Chacoan sites. Hewett and others were instrumental 
    in enacting the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906, which was the first U.S. 
    law passed to protect antiquities. The law allowed President Theodore Roosevelt 
    to proclaimed Chaco Canyon as a National Monument on March 11, 1907.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">In 1949, Chaco Canyon National Monument 
    was expanded with lands deeded from the University of New Mexico. In return, 
    the university maintained scientific research rights to the area. By 1959, 
    the National Park Service had constructed a park visitor center, staff housing, 
    and campgrounds. As a historic property of the National Park Service, the 
    National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 
    October 15, 1966. In 1987, the park was designated a World Heritage Site by 
    UNESCO. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">To safeguard Chacoan sites on adjacent 
    Bureau of Land Management and Navajo Nation lands, the Park Service developed 
    the multi-agency Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Site program. The 
    presence of more than 2,400 archaeological sites have been identified within 
    the current park's boundaries, but only a small percentage of these have been 
    excavated.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Chaco Culture National Historical 
    Park is now managed by the National Park Service, a federal agency within 
    the Department of the Interior. Neighboring federal lands with Chacoan roads 
    are under the control of the Bureau of Land Management. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The Chaco American Indian Consultation 
    Committee was established in 1991 in order to allow Navajo, Hopi, Pueblo, 
    and other Native American representatives a voice in the park&#8217;s management 
    in order to assure protection of their heritage at Chaco Canyon.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">In addition to campgrounds in the 
    canyon, the park's visitor center features the Chaco Collection Museum, an 
    information desk, a theater, a book store and a gift shop, but very few artifacts 
    remain on location at Chaco Canyon.<br>

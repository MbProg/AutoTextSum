The Architecture of Chaco Canyon, New Mexico
Lekson, Stephen H
Publication Year: 2007
The structures of Chaco Canyon, built by native peoples between AD 850 and 1130, are among the most compelling ancient monuments on earth.
Recognized as a World Heritage Site, these magnificent ruins are consistently featured in scholarly books and popular media.
Yet, like Chaco itself, these buildings are anomalous in Southwestern archaeology and much debated.
In a century of study, our understanding and means of approaching these ruins have grown considerably.
Important tree-ring dating, GIS research, and computer imaging point to the need for a new volume on Chaco architecture that unifies older information with the new.
The chapters in this volume focus on Chaco Great Houses and consider three overlapping themes: studies of technology and building types, analyses of architectural change, and readings of the built environment.
To aid reconsideration there are over 150 maps, floor plans, elevations, and photos, including a number of color illustrations.

As the largest of the numerous ruins in Chaco Canyon, Pueblo Bonito drew the attention of the first archaeologists who visited the area in the latter part of the nineteenth century.
With its multi-story walls of fine masonry and its extensive rubble mound, Pueblo Bonito appeared to be a stunning architectural achievement in this remote and desolate canyon (Figure 5.1).

pp. 155-178
Chetro Ketl was either the largest or the second largest building in Chaco, after Pueblo Bonito.
Some archaeologists thought Bonito bigger; others favored Chetro Ketl.
Its construction (990 to 1115) began almost a century later than Pueblo Bonito’s, but Chetro Ketl soon rivaled its older neighbor as the architectural focus of “downtown” Chaco.

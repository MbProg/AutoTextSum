Chetro Ketl
c. 990–c. 1115 CE. Chaco Culture National Historical Park Loop Rd.
Chetro Ketl is a first-order Chacoan great house and a key structure in                     “Downtown Chaco.” It is distinguished equally by its monumental dimensions and by its colonnade of                     stone piers, the only example in prehistoric North America and a tantalizing link with the                     Pre-Columbian architecture of Mesoamerica. The origin and meaning of its name is unknown.
This great house has never been completely excavated and, encompassing some                     three acres in area, could be larger than its famous neighbor to the west, Pueblo Bonito. The                     abundant timbers that survive in its ruins have provided archaeologists with sixty percent of the                     tree-ring dating of structures in Chaco Canyon. The first formal archaeological fieldwork at Chetro                     Ketl was undertaken by Edgar Hewett, who excavated roughly two-thirds of its rooms in 1920–1921 and                     1929–1937; between 200 and 225 ground floor rooms are presently visible.
Chetro Ketl shares with Pueblo Bonito a D-shape plan, precise north-south                     orientation, and core-and-veneer masonry construction. Yet the two great houses are otherwise                     dissimilar, pointing to the probability that each was built to specific plans for specific purposes,                     instead of being vernacular variations on a common type of communal dwelling.
Chetro Ketl was begun later and completed in less time (circa 990–1115) than                     Pueblo Bonito. Hewett marveled at the sophistication of its banded masonry veneer and at the sheer                     material size of a project that he estimated had required some fifty million pieces of stone to                     complete. Backed to the north against a continuous straight wall nearly 480 feet long, the room                     block has an E-shape plan that faces south onto the plaza with extended wings to the east and west                     and a broad yet shallow pavilion in the center.
A curved wall, 700 feet in length and containing double rows of rooms, reaches out from the two wings to embrace the plaza and its monumental great kiva. At 62.5 feet in diameter,                     this kiva is one of the larger ones in Chaco Canyon, slightly smaller than Casa Rinconada. Between                     twelve and eighteen smaller kivas are imbedded in the three arms of the room block. The plaza itself                     stands on a huge earth platform, containing 15,000 cubic yards of earth and raised twelve feet above                     grade, with evidence of multiple earlier structures beneath.
The most unusual, and distinctive, feature of Chetro Ketl is the colonnade of                     masonry piers that fronts the central pavilion on the plaza. Later walled in, the colonnade                     originally formed a roofed porch. Unique in pre-Columbian North America, it most closely resembles                     buildings at the Mayan city of Chichen Itzá and at Tula, the Toltec capitol in central Mexico. It                     was thought initially that itinerant merchants, or pochtecas, provided a                     direct link between Chaco and the Toltecs, but recent scholarship has theorized a more indirect path                     of influence through northwest Mexico. Whatever the source, the colonnade provides striking evidence                     that the civilizations of ancient America were far less isolated than popular conceptions might have                     us believe.

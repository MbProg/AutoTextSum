A review of Pieter Bruegel by larry silver
Share
More than any other Northern European painter, Pieter Bruegel (c. 1525–69) appeals to our modern sensibility and taste. Larry Silver concludes his excellent new book by discussing Bruegel’s influence—through his two artist-sons—on later Flemish and Dutch art. But he doesn’t mention the influence on modern works: of Bruegel’s Magpie on the Gallows on Claude Monet’s The Magpie, in which an ominous black bird also stands sentinel on a wooden crossbar in the midst of a wild landscape; and of The Harvesters on D. H. Lawrence’s painting Boccaccio Story, in which the sleeping peasant has the same triangular, sprawling, massive legs that emphasize his crotch. Christ Carrying the Cross inspired the recent Polish film The Mill and the Cross. The Blind Leading the Blind, a series of sightless eyes and stumbling men, inspired one of the most poignant photographs of the Great War: a progression of British soldiers, blinded by poison gas, bandaged and shuffling toward the refuge of a field hospital.
The same poignant painting inspired the poem “Les Aveugles,” whose title echoes Bruegel’s name. Charles Baudelaire writes, “Their eyes, from which the divine spark has departed, as though they were staring into the distance, remain lifted towards the sky.” The painter also inspired William Carlos Williams’ book of poems, Pictures from Brueghel. In “The Dance,” Williams writes that in the self-indulgent and uncontrolled excess of Peasant Kermis, “the dancers go round, they go round and/ around” driven by “the squeal and the blare and the/ tweedle of bagpipes.”
The Triumph of Death, in which two doomed lovers, blind to the devastating army of death and overshadowed by a menacing skeleton, inspired Sylvia Plath’s equally morbid “Two Views of a Cadaver Room.” Plath writes,
In Bruegel’s panorama of smoke and slaughter
Two people only are blind to the carrion army . . . .
Both of them deaf to the fiddle in the hands
Of the death’s-head shadowing their song.
These Flemish lovers flourish; not for long.
Silver observes that in this “mortal combat between the living and the dead in a devastated landscape . . . the skeletal army wages war in tight formation behind a phalanx of coffin lids.”
The Fall of Icarus inspired Auden’s “Musée des Beaux Arts,” in which “the plowman may/ Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,/ But for him it was not an important failure.” In the painting, the larger-than-life Icarus, his head submerged and with only one hand and two legs showing, dies from the impact of his crash into the sea. He’s ignored not only by the plowman—who has a beaky nose, tiny mouth, delicate tread, and whose skirt-folds echo the furrows he cuts into the ground—but also by the shepherd, fisherman, and sailors in the high rigging of the wind-blown ship. These bystanders may represent diligence and industry rather than (as in Auden’s wartime poem) callous indifference to the approaching catastrophe.
The construction of King Nimrod’s massive but already tilted Tower of Babel, Silver writes, “strives to imitate the realm of the divine, to reach above the very clouds through man-made effort.” But it surely portrays the same hubris and imminent doom of the fallen Icarus. Viewers of Bruegel’s massive miniatures must search for the real subjects—Icarus, Bride and Groom, Mad Meg, Christ preaching, or Christ carrying the cross—amid a mass of vertiginous, obscure, and sometimes disgusting details. Silver notes how the scores of “tiny figures swarming across a vast landscape . . . challenge the viewer to sift and recognize the spiritual content of the main subject.”
Silver might have said more about The Misanthrope, a masterpiece of naturalistic observation, both realistic and symbolic, dramatic and reflective, which Saul Bellow describes in chapter ten of The Adventures of Augie March. In the painting, a wide-eyed, round-faced, crouching barefoot thief, dressed in ragged lilac clothing and enclosed in a glass orb surmounted by a cross, stares brazenly out of the picture as he cuts the bright red purse that hangs by a cord from the waist of the self-absorbed misanthrope. The tall, gloomy wanderer, whose upright cone-shaped figure contrasts with the stooping round thief, wears a deep-blue cape and tasseled monkish cowl that covers his eyes. He walks with his hands clasped before him, lost in meditation, and is unaware of the three sharp caltrops dangerously strewn in his path. The cut-purse disturbs the faithful shepherd in the quiet landscape, mars the meditations of the misanthrope, and expresses Bruegel’s deeply pessimistic view of mankind.
Bruegel moved from Antwerp to Brussels, from prints to paintings, from traditional Catholicism to covert but patriotic sympathy with the Protestants oppressed by Spanish rule in the Netherlands. A contemporary wrote that the painter
often went out into the country to see the peasants at their fairs and weddings. Disguised as a peasant, he brought gifts like the other guests, claiming kinship with the bride or groom. Here Bruegel delighted in observing their droll behavior, how they ate, drank, danced, capered or made love.
His pictures contrast honest toil and domestic virtues with crude sexual and alcoholic dissipation.
Silver is especially good on Bruegel’s original and inventive variations on Bosch’s recurrent motifs. In works like The Fall of the Rebel Angels and Mad Meg, Bruegel—with a Rabelaisian emphasis on bulging codpieces and bodily functions—also created monstrous, hybrid, crawling land animals with bird beaks and wings, fish scales and teeth, or birds with human faces and fish with legs and wings. Devils, who did their evil business in the world and then punished the transgressors in hell, were all too real for Bruegel. His curious and powerful mind portrayed the monstrous and hallucinatory, the demonic and diverting with infinite inventions, painful incongruities, frenetic activities, animated nightmares, and pandemic atrocities.
Silver’s hard-to-handle eight-pound book is the sort of valuable tome that used to be chained to benches in the Vatican Library. Lavishly illustrated and with illuminating comparative paintings, it presents learned, clear, and convincing explanations of many obscure but significant details in the complex paintings.
In the placid and popular Hunters in the Snow, the three hunters descend a hill with their pack of scrawny dogs, carrying only one meager hare. On their left, as Williams writes in his descriptive poem,
. . . the cold
inn yard is
deserted but for a huge bonfire
that flares wind-driven tended by
women who cluster
about it.
Beneath the dangling inn sign, a family prepares a fire to smoke and preserve their slaughtered pig. A vast frosty landscape, broken by bare-branched trees with standing rooks, unfolds below them. Two frozen gray ponds support energetic skaters, hockey players, and ice fishermen. One woman drags a friend in a sled while another carries faggots across a sturdy bridge. In the middle distance, a horse pulls a heavily laden cart toward a church and steeple, and fiery smoke blows out of the chimney of a distant, snow-covered house. In the background, the incongruous, jagged, snow-capped mountains, which Bruegel saw on his trans-alpine journey to Italy, provide a striking contrast to the flat landscape of Flanders. The tranquility, harmony, and sheer beauty of this deeply satisfying painting testifies to Bruegel’s perennial appeal.
Jeffrey Meyers 's recent books include Robert Lowell in Love (University of Massachusetts Press).

Pictures and Poetry: more Pieter Brueghel
American poet William Carlos Williams didn't put on literary airs, and is well-loved for the natural, colloquial style of his poetry.
Is it any wonder that he was especially taken with the earthy lives of the peasantry in Pieter Brueghel's work, and as he might say, their workaday world?
Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems was Williams' final book, which won a Pulitzer prize shortly after his death in 1963.
Here are four of the poems and the Brueghel paintings that inspired them:
Pieter Brueghel The Kermess oil on canvas 45" x 64.5" (1567-8)
The Dance
by William Carlos Williams
In Breughel's great picture, The Kermess,
the dancers go round, they go round and
around, the squeal and the blare and the
tweedle of bagpipes, a bugle and fiddles
tipping their bellies (round as the thick-
sided glasses whose wash they impound)
their hips and their bellies off balance
to turn them.
Kicking and rolling about
the Fair Grounds, swinging their butts, those
shanks must be sound to bear up under such
rollicking measures, prance as they dance
in Breughel's great picture, The Kermess.
Pieter Brueghel The Corn Harvest oil on panel 47" x 64" (1565)
The Corn Harvest
by William Carlos Williams
Summer!
the painting is organized
about a young
reaper enjoying his
noonday rest
completely
relaxed
from his morning labors
sprawled
in fact sleeping
unbuttoned
on his back
the women
have brought him his lunch
perhaps
a spot of wine
they gather gossiping
under a tree
whose shade
carelessly
he does not share the
resting
center of
their workaday world
Pieter Brueghel The Blind Leading the Blind oil on linen canvas 34"x 61" (1568)
The Parable of the Blind
by William Carlos Williams
This horrible but superb painting
the parable of the blind
without a red
in the composition shows a group
of beggars leading
each other diagonally downward
across the canvas
from one side
to stumble finally into a bog
where the picture
and the composition ends back
of which no seeing man
is represented the unshaven
features of the des-
titute with their few
pitiful possessions in a basin
to wash in a peasant
cottage is seen and a church spire
the faces are raised
as toward the light
there is no detail extraneous
to the composition one
follows the others stick in
hand triumphant to disaster
Pieter Brueghel The Hunters in the Snow oil on wood 46"x 64" (1565)
The Hunters in the Snow
by William Carlos Williams
The over-all picture is winter
icy mountains
in the background the return
from the hunt it is toward evening
from the left
sturdy hunters lead in
their pack the inn-sign
hanging from a
broken hinge is a stag a crucifix
between his antlers the cold
inn yard is
deserted but for a huge bonfire
the flares wind-driven tended by
women who cluster
about it to the right beyond
the hill is a pattern of skaters
Brueghel the painter
concerned with it all has chosen
a winter-struck bush for his
foreground to
complete the picture
Ever the storyteller, the details in Brueghel's paintings never dissolve into the abstracted color and shape of most modern realist paintings, but reveal one vignette after another:

Bruegel: The Blind leading the Blind
At the time there was war between Catholics and Protestants.
They killed each other on the question whether faith alone was sufficient to reach heaven or whether good works were of prime importance.

Because of this quarrel, some charities lost prestige and beggars became suspect of using make-up to fool soft hearts.
It is not known whether the lurid diagonal composition with that Catholic church in the background is meant to cover up or expose political anger.
Bruegel may have been a Calvinist*** and had to fear the Inquisition.
This would at least explain why so little is known about his life.
It might also explain why even now his work is sometimes described and sold as "landscape paintings".

This child is from a painting called "Peasant Wedding".
It's not the only place where he makes a child look so silly.

All the beauty and at times very much of it, goes into some distant background.
The people are ugly and silly, mostly, and unhappy.
It is difficult to find a beautiful lady, for instance, though I think there are some in a famous painting by him, where  a lpicnic party or some public fiesta seems to be going on, but in fact it is the hour before the execution of Jesus who is almost invisible, though placed in the center of the composition, dragging his cross up the hill:

There, in the foreground, there are some ladies in beautiful robes: the Virgin Mary and her friends attending the terrible celebration.
Next to them there is a white horse to draw your attention to a bar just aboe it: the cross, and Jesus falling beneath it.

What does THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND mean?
The Blind Leading the Blind
The Blind Leading the Blind, also Blind or The Parable of the Blind, is a 1568 painting by Flemish renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder.
Executed in tempera on linen canvas it is the earliest painting to depict the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from the Gospel of Matthew 15:14.
The work is kept in the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, Italy.
Breughel achieved such a level of Renaissance realism in The Blind Leading the Blind that the individual inflictions of each of the blind men can be determined, such as black cataracts and corneal leukemia.
Painted the year before Bruegel's death, the painting has a bitter, sorrowful tone likely springing from the establishment of the Council of Troubles in 1567 by the government of the Spanish Netherlands.
The council led to mass arrests and executions to enforce Spanish rule and suppress Protestantism.
Though it has been interpreted so by some, it is not clear if the painting was meant as a political statement.
The placement of Sint-Anna Church of the village Sint-Anna-Pede has occasioned pro- and anti-Catholic interpretations.
The diagonal composition of The Blind Leading the Blind reinforces the off-kilter motion of the six figures falling in progression, a focus on motion that has been seen as prefiguring motion pictures.
The painting shows Bruegel as a master of observation: the figures each have a different recognizable eye affliction, including corneal leukemia, atrophy of globe, and removed eyes, and they hold their heads aloft so as to make better use of their less impaired senses.

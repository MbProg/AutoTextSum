.
At the time there was war between Catholics and Protestants.
They killed  each other on the question whether faith alone was sufficient to reach  heaven or whether good works were of prime importance.

Because of this quarrel, some charities lost prestige and beggars became suspect of using make-up to fool soft hearts.
It is not known whether the lurid diagonal composition with that Catholic church in the background is meant to cover up or expose political anger.
Bruegel may have been a Calvinist*** and had to fear the Inquisition.
This would at least explain why so little is known about his life.
It might also explain why even now his work is sometimes described and sold as "landscape paintings".

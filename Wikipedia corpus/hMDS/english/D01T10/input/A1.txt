Blind Leading the Blind Meaning & Explanation
(Please scroll further down for Bible Verses & Quotes)
The Parable of The Blind Leading The Blind compels us to examine and reexamine what is truly important in living our lives as Christians.
It contrasts outwardly religious and often pretentious acts to what is truly important – what is deep inside of us, what is deep inside our hearts, our faith in God, trust in God and obedience to God.
In The Bible days, there were several rules about what to eat and what not to eat, and a great deal of emphasis was placed on washing your hands, and so on.
The Pharisees and religious leaders of the day put a lot of importance on all these things.
It became easy for many to believe that as long as one kept those rules and regulations, they were fine with God – even if their inner hearts and thoughts were far away from God.
Jesus called this attitude and common occurrence an example of the blind leading the blind.
If our focus is on outwardly acts of religion, if what we care about the most is what others can see, then we are blind, and whoever is following us is blind…and we are all on a road to destruction in that case (God forbid)!
Conversely, if our hearts are right with God, everything else with ultimately fall into place, and by God’s grace we will live lives that are truly pleasing to God – regardless of what others might think of us.
This parable also serves as a strong warning to us to be careful who we follow blindly.
We need to continually put our trust in God, not in man.
This is not to minimize the importance of good, God-led spiritual leaders, teachers and role models.
But we have to remember ask God to continually give us wisdom as well as spiritual discernment, so that we do not just follow anybody that claims to be on the right path blindly.
The following scriptures are a reminder of this discussion:
On wisdom, searching for wisdom & asking God for wisdom:
James 1:5 (ESV) “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.”
Proverbs 2:1-5(NASB)
“My son, if you will receive my words
And treasure my commandments within you,
Make your ear attentive to wisdom, Incline your heart to understanding;
For if you cry for discernment, Lift your voice for understanding;
If you seek her as silver, And search for her as for hidden treasures;
Then you will discern the fear of the LORD
And discover the knowledge of God.”
On spiritual discernment:
“Stop judging by the way things look, but judge by what is really right.”
1 John 4:1(ESV)
“Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.”
We have to rely on the help of God’s Holy Spirit to lead us, guide us, help us to grow and know God more and more each day, and to understand exactly what God desires and expects from us.
We have to pray that God will give us wisdom to know right from wrong.
Those who teach false doctrines blindly, as well as those who blindly follow these false doctrines, will all end up in a pit (or a ditch)!
The Parable of the Blind Leading the Blind – Things to Consider
Whose teachings are we following?
Whose examples are we following?
Are we following spiritual leaders blindly, or are we being discerning, trusting and following God’s leading, and making sure whatever we are involved in lines up with God’s truth?
Let’s pray to God to open our eyes and help us see!
Let’s pray to God to help us to be spiritually discerning, that we may not unknowingly follow anyone into a pit!
And let’s pray to God concerning those who may look to us for guidance, those whom we are ‘leading’ by example, mentorship or otherwise, let us pray that God may help us to lead them aright – as He desires.
May we never ever lead others astray.
Amen.

“Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.”

Will they not both fall into a pit?
A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher.
Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye?
You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother’s eye.”

Pictures and Poetry: more Pieter Brueghel
American poet William Carlos Williams didn't put on literary airs, and is well-loved for the natural, colloquial style of his poetry. Is it any wonder that he was especially taken with the earthy lives of the peasantry in Pieter Brueghel's work, and as he might say, their workaday world? 
Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems was Williams' final book, which won a Pulitzer prize shortly after his death in 1963. Here are four of the poems and the Brueghel paintings that inspired them:  
Pieter Brueghel The Kermess oil on canvas 45" x 64.5" (1567-8)
The Dance

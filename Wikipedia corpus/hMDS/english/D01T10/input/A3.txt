Your Art Gallery: Allegorical Paintings
The answer is: Pieter Bruegel the Elder
Interesting Information:
We have seen the work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder elsewhere in this virtual gallery.
One of the greatest artists of the Renaissance period, Bruegel was born in Breda, Netherlands around 1525 and is best known for his landscapes and peasant scenes.
Painted just a year before the artist's death, "The Blind Leading the Blind, Blind" (also sometimes called "The Parable of the Blind") shows figures with different afflictions of the eye finding their way in a disorderly line.
Painted in distemper on linen canvas, this painting can be seen at the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, Italy.

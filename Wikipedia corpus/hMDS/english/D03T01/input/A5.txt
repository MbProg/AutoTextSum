The Edmonton Journal was founded on Nov. 11, 1903, by three local businessmen—John Macpherson, Arthur Moore and J.W. Cunningham—as a rival to the 23-year-old  Edmonton Bulletin , Alberta ‘s first newspaper.
The three newsmen produced the first edition of The Edmonton Journal at the back of the Shamrock Fruit Store with the mission to provide reliable and relevant news to city.
After taking issue with Alberta Premier  William Aberhart ‘s attempt to pass the  Accurate News and Information Act  in 1937,  the Journal became the first non-American newspaper to be honoured by the  Pulitzer Prize  committee.
The paper also received a plaque in 1938 for defending the  freedom of the press .

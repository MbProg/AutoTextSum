Facts: This case considers the validity of three provincial acts of Alberta. The reasoning reproduced in the case book is with regards to the Alberta Accurate News and Information Act. Sections 3 and 4 of the Act provide that newspapers published in Alberta must perform duties on the demand of the "Chairman" of the Board constituted by s. 3 of The Alberta Social Credit Act. (s. 3 basically allows the Chairman to dictate what newspapers can say about government policy. s. 4 allows the Chairman to demand specific information on any of the sources from which a newspaper received any information it published.)
Issue: Is the Alberta Accurate News and Information Act intra vires the legislature of Alberta?
Held: No, the Act is ultra vires.
Reasoning (Duff C.J. and Davis J.):
- The "Board" is a non-existent body, so ss. 3 and 4 are inoperative, as are ss. 6 and 7 (which provide sanctions).
- Also, the Bill seems to be part of the general scheme of Social Credit legislation under the Alberta Social Credit Act and thus presupposes that the latter is validly enacted, which it is not.
- BNA Act contemplates legislative power for Canada being vested in one Parliament, and a House of Commons as being a representative body, working under the influence of public opinion and discussion. This right, "notwithstanding its incidental mischiefs, is the breath of life for parliamentary institutions." Not only does the Parliament of Canada undoubtedly possess authority to legislate for protection of this right, it would be beyond the power of provincial legislatures to "abrogate this right ... or to suppress the traditional forms of the exercise of its right." The subject matter of such legislation could not be considered wholly provincial. It would be contrary to the implications of the BNA Act.
- Some degree of newspaper regulation can be accorded to the provinces, but not when it is so substantial as to interfere with the working of parliamentary institutions as contemplated in the BNA Act.
- Alberta's legislature does not have capacity under s. 129 to alter the law by legislation "obnoxious to the principle stated."
- The legislation gives the Chairman autocratic powers which "could, if arbitrarily wielded, be employed to frustrate in Alberta these rights of the Crown and the people of Canada as a whole."
Reasoning (Cannon J.):
- This bill deals with the regulation of the press of Alberta, not in the context of "private wrongs or civil injuries resulting from any alleged infringement or privation of civil rights which belong to individuals, considered as individuals, but from the viewpoint of public wrongs or crimes, i.e., involving a violation of the public rights and duties to the whole community, considered as a community, in its social aggregate capacity."
- So, the matters dealt with in this bill are not purely private and local: the Act tends to nullify Albertan inhabitants' political rights AND the political rights of citizens of Canada.
- Our (British) system does not allow a political party to erect a prohibitory barrier to prevent electors from getting information about the government's policy. Freedom of discussion "is essential to enlighten public opinion in a democratic State; it cannot be curtailed without affecting the right of the people to be informed."
Ratio (Duff C.J. and Davis J.): "[T]here is a very wide field in which the provinces undoubtedly are invested with legislative authority over newspapers; but the limit, in our opinion is reached when the legislation effects such a curtailment of the exercise of the right of public discussion as substantially to interfere with the working of the parliamentary institutions of Canada as contemplated by the provisions of The British North America Act and the statutes of the Dominion of Canada."
Ratio (Cannon J.): "Democracy cannot be maintained without its foundation: free public opinion and free discussion throughout the nation of all matter affecting the State within the limits set by the criminal code and the common law. Every inhabitant [of a province] is also a citizen of the Dominion. The province may deal with his property and civil rights of a local and private nature within the province; but the province cannot interfere with his status as a Canadian citizen and his fundamental right to express freely his untrammelled opinion about government policies and discuss matters of public concern."

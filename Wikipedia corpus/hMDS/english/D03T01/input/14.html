<P class="Metadata">IN THE MATTER OF THREE BILLS PASSED BY THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA AT THE 1937 (THIRD SESSION)
THEREOF, ENTITLED RE&shy;SPECTIVELY:</P>

<P class="Metadata">&quot; An Act Respecting the Taxation of
Banks &quot;;</P>

<P class="Metadata">&quot; An Act to Amend and Consolidate the
Credit of Alberta Regulations Act &quot;; and</P>

<P class="Metadata">&quot; An Act to Ensure the Publication of Accurate
News and Information &quot;;</P>

<P class="Metadata">and reserved by the Lieutenant-Governor for
the significa&shy;tion of the Governor General's pleasure.</P>

<P class="Metadata">1938, Jan. 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, Mar. 4</P>

<P class="Metadata">PRESENT:&mdash;Duff C.J. and Cannon, Crocket,
Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.</P>

<P class="Keywords">Constitutional law&mdash;Alberta statutes&mdash;The Bank
Taxation Act&mdash;The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, 1937&mdash;The Accurate News and
Information Act&mdash;The Alberta Social Credit Act&mdash;Constitutional validity&mdash;B.N.A.
Act, 1867, ss. 91, 92</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpFirst">The Bank Taxation Act, The Credit of
Alberta Regulations Act, 1937 and The Accurate News and Information Act are
ultra vires of the provincial
legislature of Alberta.</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpMiddle">The Alberta Social Credit Act is
ultra vires of the provincial
legislature. Cannon J. expressing no opinion..</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpMiddle">Per Duff C.J. and Davis and Hudson
JJ.&mdash;Such legislation does not come within section 92 (13 or 16) of the B.N.A.
Act; it is not within the power of that province to establish such statutory
machinery with the functions for which this machinery is designed and to
regulate the operation of it: such machinery, in part at least, as subject
matter of legislation, comes within the field designated by
&quot;Currency,&quot; (s. 91 (14) B.N.A. Act).</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpMiddle">Per Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin
and Hudson. JJ.&mdash;Such machinery, as established by The Alberta Social Credit
Act, in its essential components and features, comes under head no. 15,
&quot;Banks and Banking.&quot;</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpMiddle">Per Duff C.J. and Davis and Hudson
JJ.&mdash;Even if such legislation is not strictly within the ambit of no. 14 ,or no,
15, or partly in one or partly in the other, then this legislation is ultra vires as its subject-matter is embraced
within category no. 2 of s. 91, &quot;Regulation of Trade and Commerce.&quot;</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpMiddle">Held, by the Court, that the Bank
Taxation Act is not an enactment in exercise of the provincial power to raise a
revenue for provin&shy;cial purposes by direct taxation, but is legislation which,
in its true character and by ascertaining its effect in the known circum&shy;stances
to which it is to be applied, relates to &quot;Incorporation of Banks and
Banking&quot; (s. 91 (15) B.N.A. Act).</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpLast">Per Duff C.J. and Cannon, Davis and
Hudson JJ.&mdash;The rate of taxation provided by that Act must be prohibitive in fact
and must be known</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 101]</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpFirst">to the Alberta legislature to be
prohibitive. It is not competent to the provinces of Canada, by the exercise of their powers of taxation, to force banks
which <I>are </I>carrying on business under the authority of the <I>Bank Act </I>to
discontinue business; and taxation by <I>one </I>prov&shy;ince on a scale which, in
a practical business sense, is manifestly pro&shy;hibitive is not a valid exercise
of provincial legislative authority under section 92. Such legislation, though
in the form of <I>a </I>taxing statute is &quot;directed to&quot; the
frustration of the system of banking established by the <I>Bank Act, </I>and <I>to
</I>the controlling of banks in the conduct of their business.</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpMiddle"><I>Per </I>Crocket
and Kerwin JJ.&mdash;The <I>Bank Taxation Act, </I>instead of being a taxing
enactment, is merely a part of a legislative plan to prevent the operation
within the province of those banking institutions which have been called into
existence and given the necessary powers to conduct their business by the only
proper authority, the Parlia&shy;ment of Canada.</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpMiddle"><I>Held, </I>by the Court, that <I>The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, 1937, is
</I>legislation in relation to &quot;Banking&quot; (s,. 91 (15) B.N.A. Act);
and, <I>per </I>Duff C.J. and Davis and Hudson. JJ., it is also legislation in
relation to &quot;The regulation of trade and commerce &quot; within the
meaning of section 91 (2).</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpMiddle"><I>Per Duff </I>C.J. and Davis and Hudson JJ.&mdash;This Act is a part of a general scheme
<I>of </I>legislation <I>of </I>which <I>The Social Credit Act </I>is really
the basis; and, that latter Act being <I>ultra vires, </I>ancillary and
dependent legislation falls with it.</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpMiddle"><I>Held, </I>by the Court (except Cannon J.) that <I>The Alberta Accurate News
and Information Act </I>forms part of the general scheme of social credit
legislation, the basis of which is <I>The Alberta Social Credit Act; </I>and
since that Act is <I>ultra vires, </I>ancillary and dependent legislation must
fall with it.</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpMiddle"><I>Per </I>Duff
C.J. and Davis J.&mdash;Under the constitution established by the B.N.A. Act,
legislative power for Canada is vested in <I>one </I>Parlia&shy;ment <I>and </I>that
statute contemplates <I>a </I>parliament working under the influence of public
opinion and public discussion. The Parliament of Canada possesses authority to
legislate for the protection of that right; and any attempt to abrogate that
right of public debate or to suppress the traditional forms of the exercise of
such right (in public meeting or through the press) would be incompetent to the
legislatures <I>of </I>the provinces. Moreover, the law by which 'the right of
public discussion is protected existed at the time of the enactment of <I>The
British North America Act </I>and the legislature of Alberta has not the
capacity under section 129 <I>of </I>that Act <I>to </I>alter that law by
legislation obnoxious to the principle stated.</P>

<P class="SummaryCxSpLast"><I>Per </I>Cannon
J.&mdash;The mandatory and prohibitory provisions of the <I>Alberta Accurate News and
Information Act </I>interfere with <I>the </I>free working of the political
organization of the Dominion. They have a tendency to nullify the political
rights of the inhabitants of Alberta and of the citizens outside the province,
as citizens of Canada, and cannot be considered as dealing with matters purely
private and local in that province. The federal parliament is the sole
authority to curtail, if deemed expedient and in the public interest, the
freedom of the press in discussing public affairs and the equal rights in that
respect of all citizens throughout the Dominion. These subjects were matters of
criminal law before Confederation, have been recognized by</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 102]</P>

<P class="Summary">Parliament as criminal matters and have been
expressly dealt with by the criminal code. Such an Act is an attempt by the
legislature to amend the Criminal Code in this respect and to deny the
advantage of section 133 (a) of that Code to the newspaper pub&shy;lishers,</P>

General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada in the exer&shy;cise of the

August, 1937, be disallowed; that upon the same date, the Deputy of the
Governor General did certify under his sign manual and seal that the said Acts
were received by him on the 10th day of August, 1937; and that by proclamation
of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the province of Alberta, dated August
27, 1937, published in the issue of the <I>Canada </I><I>Gazette of </I>September 11, 1937
(at page 686), reciting the tenor of the said Order in Council and Certificate,
the disallowance of the said Acts was duly signified.</P>

<P class="Indent1">passed by the Legislative Assembly of the province

Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, on the 5th October, 1937, reserved for the
signification of the Governor General's pleasure; and that authentic copies of
the Bills so reserved were received by the Secretary of State of Canada on the
12th October, 1937;</P>

<P class="Indent1">6. That in a submission set forth in a letter
of October 12th, 1937, to the Right Honourable the Prime Minister of Canada,
the Honourable William Aberhart, Premier of the Government of the province of
Alberta, stated, with reference to said Bill No. 8: &quot; Should there be any
doubt as to the constitutional validity of the press bill, we have no objection
whatever to having it referred to the courts along with the question of disallowance,&quot;
and, after making certain observations with particular reference to said Bills
Nos. 1 and 8, concluded: &quot; For all these reasons we contend that the
question of disallowance and the press bill might well be referred to the
courts for a decision.&quot;</P>

<P class="Indent1">And whereas the Minister of Justice reports
that doubts exist or are entertained as to whether the legislature of the
province of Alberta has legislative jurisdiction to enact the provisions of
said Bills Nos. 1, 8 and 9 (authentic copies whereof are hereto annexed); and,
reserving for the time being the consideration of what advice ought to be
tendered to the Governor General as to the propriety of signifying, or of
withholding signification of, the royal assent to the said Bills, he is of
opinion that it is expedient that the question aforementioned should be
referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for judicial determination.</P>

<P class="Indent1">Now, therefore, His Excellency the Governor
General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice and
pursuant to the provisions of section 55 of the <I>Supreme Court Act, </I>is
pleased to refer and doth hereby refer the following questions to the Supreme
Court of Canada for hearing and consideration:</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 106]</P>

<P class="Indent1">1. Is Bill No. 1, entitled &quot; An Act

<P class="Sollicitors">J. L. Ralston K.C., S. W. Field K.C. and
R. de W. MacKay K.C. for the Alberta newspapers.</P>

<P class="Para">The judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis J. was
delivered by</P>

<P class="Para">THE CHIEF JUSTICE.&mdash;The
three Bills referred to us are part of a general scheme of legislation and in
order to ascertain the object and effect of them it is proper to look at the
history of the legislation passed in furtherance of the general design.</P>

<P class="Para">It is no part of our duty (it is, perhaps,
needless to say) to consider the wisdom of these measures. We have only to
ascertain whether or not they come within the ambit of the authority entrusted
by the constitutional statutes (the</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 107]</P>

<P class="Para"><I>British North
America Act </I>and the Alberta Act) to the legislature
of Alberta and our responsibility is rigorously confined to the determination
of that issue. As judges, we do not and cannot intimate any opinion upon the
merits of the legislative proposals embodied in them, as to their
practicability or in any other respect.</P>

<P class="Para">It will be necessary, first of all, to examine
with some care the central measure, which <I>is The Alberta Social Credit Act, </I>and to arrive at a proper conception of its character from the
constitutional point of view.</P>

<P class="Para">Various declarations throughout the enacting
provisions of this statute, as well as in the preamble, leave no room for doubt
as to its objects. We cite verbatim some of these declarations because we think
it is important to have before us the language selected by the Legislature
itself to describe the purpose of the legislation and the general nature and
functions of the machinery which is to be put into operation,</P>

<P class="Para">To appreciate the significance of these
declarations, however, it is necessary to advert to the constitution and nature
of the three bodies set up by the statute for the administration of the Act as
well as to the statutory definition of &quot; Alberta Credit.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">There is, first, a Board which is designated
simply as &quot; The Board&quot;; the first members of which are named by the
statute, their successors being appointed by the Legislature. Then there is the
Provincial Credit Com&shy;mission which is to be appointed by the Board; and here
it is convenient to mention the duties of the Commission in determining the
value of &quot; Alberta Credit.&quot; &quot; Alberta Credit &quot; is defined
by section 2 <I>(a) </I>as,</P>

<P class="Citation1">the unused capacity of the industries and
people of the province of Alberta to produce wanted goods and services.</P>

<P class="Para">By section 5 (1) there is to be an account in
the treasury of the province known as the Provincial Credit Account. The
Commission is to determine, in the manner prescribed by the Act, the value for
each year of the</P>

<P class="Citation1">unused capacity of the industries and
people of the province of Alberta to produce wanted goods and services;</P>

<P class="Para">in other words, the value in money (section 2
(k)) of &quot; Alberta Credit.&quot; This amount is to be credited to the
Provincial Credit &quot;Account and &quot; at the end of each year the amount
&quot; in this account &quot; which shall not have been</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 108]</P>

<P class="Para">drawn upon in that year shall be written
off.&quot; The decisions of the Board and of the Commission in the
determination of the annual money value of this &quot; unused capacity &quot;
are to be final and are to govern the Provincial Treasurer in the establishment
and maintenance of the &quot; Provincial Credit Account.&quot; It is this &quot;
Alberta Credit &quot; annually determined and credited to the Provincial Credit
Account which constitutes, according to the plan of the statute, a fund of
credit that is to be employed and put into circulation through the machinery
set up by the Act in order to facilitate the exchange of goods ,and services
and generally to effectuate the purposes of the Act.</P>

<P class="Para">Then, there is the Alberta Credit House which is
a department of the provincial administration, constituted by the Commission
and a body corporate; and which is to maintain branches throughout the
province.</P>

<P class="Para">A reference is also necessary to Treasury Credit
Certifi&shy;cates. These are issued by the Provincial Treasurer against the
Provincial Credit Account from time to time through the Credit House system.</P>

<P class="Para">Among the declarations expounding the purpose of
the statute we refer to these:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Para">By the preamble it is affirmed :</P>

<P class="Citation1">the people of Alberta, rich in natural
wealth and resources both actual and potential, are yet heavily in debt and
have been unable to acquire and maintain a standard of living such as is
considered by them to be both desirable and possible; and</P>

<P class="Citation1">* * * the existing means or system of
distribution and exchange of wealth is considered to be inadequate, unjust and
not suited to the welfare, prosperity and happiness of the people of Alberta.</P>

<P class="Para">Section 7 provides:</P>

<P class="Citation1">It is the intent and purpose of this Act to
provide for the issue of Treasury
Credit Certificates to such extent as may be requisite for the purpose of
increasing the purchasing power of the consumers of Alberta as to make such
purchasing power conform to the productive capacity of the people 'of the
province for the production and delivery of wanted goods and services, which
capacity is declared to be the measure of Alberta Credit.</P>

<P class="Para">Section 31 declares:</P>

<P class="Citation1">The Commission shall so function and
administer this Act for the purpose and to the intent that the Treasury Credit
Certificate Account in all
branches shall be maintained in balance at all times. It is the intent of this
Act to control the volume of the means of payment for goods and services in
harmony with the ability of the whole province to produce and consume them on a
rising standard of living, so that excess expansion of credit and a consequent
undue advance in the price level</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 109]</P>

<P class="Citation1">shall not occur, and that the present
system of issuing credit through private initiative for profit, resulting in
recurrent deflations and inflations shall cease.</P>

<P class="Para">With this section, section 33 should be read. It
is in the following words :</P>

<P class="Citation1">In order to establish a system of
circulating credit which shall at all times conform to the capacity of the
industries and people of Alberta for the production of wanted goods and
services; it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Legislative Assembly of
Alberta to prevent the undue expansion of credit as well as to eliminate the
contraction of credit in time of slackening trade. It is the true meaning and
intent of this Act, whenever deemed necessary by the Commission, that the
controls over supply of credit through open market operations and the discount
rate shall be employed as heretofore to maintain a balanced credit structure.</P>

<P class="Para">To these should be added the following
statements in the <I>Social
Credit Measures Act </I>(1936) which has been repealed:</P>

<P class="Citation1">* * * the existence of indigence and
unemployment throughout a large portion of the population demonstrates the fact
that the present monetary system is obsolete and a hindrance to the efficient
production and distribu&shy;tion of goods; and</P>

<P class="Citation1">* * * the electors of the province are
favourable to the adoption in the province of a measure based .on what are
generally known as Social Credit principles, their general objects being to
bring about the equation of consumption to production, and to afford to each
person a fair share in the cultural heritage of the people in the province;</P>

<P class="Para">and this statement from the <I>Credit House Act </I>(1936) also repealed :</P>

<P class="Citation1">2 (a) &quot;Alberta Credit&quot; means the
credit provided by the Credit House for facilitating the exchange of goods and
services within the province.</P>

<P class="Para">Section 36 (b) should also be noticed:</P>

<P class="Citation1">36. In addition to the specific powers
'conferred by this Act, the Commission shall be empowered,&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1"><I>(b) </I>to
examine into, consider, investigate and formulate proposals 'having for their
object the increase of the purchasing power of the consumer by means of social
dividends, compensating discounts or by any other means and the payment to the
producer of any commodity of a just price and the allowance to any dealer in a
commodity of a fair commission on turnover, and for such purposes to ascertain
all necessary facts relating thereto, and to report to the Board as to the
feasibility of applying any such proposal or any modification thereof having
regard to the economic circumstances of 'the province and of the various
businesses, industries, trades and vocations of the people of the Province.</P>

<P class="Para">By section 42, the substance of which is given
below, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council has full power to give effect to any
report of the Commission in so far as its recommendations are not contrary to
the policy of the statute, even to the extent of altering and supplementing the
provisions of the statute itself.</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 110]</P>

<P class="Para">These declarations enable us to affirm with
certainty (1) that the evil as the Legislature conceives it with which the
statute is intended to grapple is the inability of the people of Alberta to
attain to a proper standard of living by reason of the inadequate supply or the
unfair distribu&shy;tion of purchasing power; and (2) that, broadly speaking, the
enactments in the statute are designed, to employ the phraseology of the
authors of the legislation, to equate purchasing power or effective demand with
productive capacity; and, moreover, it is easily susceptible of demon&shy;stration
by reference to the provisions of this statute in detail and to those of the
cognate legislation that these measures proceed upon this fundamental
postulate, viz., that the economic ills which they aim at curing arise
primarily from financial causes and, particularly, from the circumstance that
bank credit, which constitutes in the main, in point of volume, the circulating
medium of payment and exchange in this country, is issued through private
initiative for private profit. And, speaking in general terms, the statute sets
up the machinery of a financial system which is to be administered by statutory
authority and the predominant function of which is to provide a form of credit
designated as &quot; Alberta Credit &quot; which is to be made accessible to
consumers and others through the channels created by the Act, and which is to
circulate as a medium of exchange and payment.</P>

<P class="Para">Alberta credit (the nature of which is described
as explained above) is distributed by the Provincial Treas&shy;urer by means of
Treasury Credit Certificates; and it is his duty to issue through the Credit
House system Treasury Credit Certificates in such amounts and at such times as
may be required for the purposes of the statute. In particular, it is his duty
to issue such certificates to the branches or other agencies for the purpose of
pro&shy;viding the credits established pursuant to the requirements of section 13
for, that is to say,</P>

<P class="Indent1">(a) a discount on prices to consumers at
retail;</P>

<P class="Indent1">(b) government services;</P>

<P class="Indent1">(c) interest free loans;</P>

<P class="Indent1">(d) debt payments;</P>

<P class="Indent1">(e) export subsidies;</P>

<P class="Indent1">(f) provincial consumers' dividends;</P>

<P class="Indent1">(g) such other purposes as the
Lieutenant-Governor in Council at the request of the Board may by order so
declare.</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 111]</P>

<P class="Para">As to the purposes mentioned in section 13 (g),
it should be noticed that, by section 36 (a), in addition to the other powers
conferred by the Act, the Commission is empowered to transfer Treasury Credit
Certificates in any manner consistent with the purpose of this Act.</P>

<P class="Para">The Commission is, moreover, specifically
authorized by section 5 (3) to advance Alberta credit to persons engaged in</P>

<P class="Citation1">agriculture or manufacturing or industry *
* * and * * * to defray the costs of the building of a home or for establishing
or maintaining any business, vocation, calling or for public service.</P>

<P class="Para">It is also authorized to negotiate any transfer
of Alberta credit with any person, firm or corporate body &quot; entitled to
Alberta credit.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">Then the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is
authorized (section 10),</P>

<P class="Citation1">on the advice of the Board * * * (to)
declare that all claims against the province for the payment of any money out
of any appropriation of public money made by the Legislative Assembly * * *
shall be satisfied by the transfer to such person of an amount of Alberta
Credit.</P>

<P class="Para">equivalent to the amount of such claim, with a
proviso that, in the case of contractual obligations, all parties must agree.</P>

<P class="Para">Municipal corporations (by s. 12) are authorized
to accept transfers of Alberta credit in satisfaction of any claim and to
transfer such Alberta credit to persons who are willing to accept the same in
satisfaction or partial satisfaction of their claims for the carrying out of
any public work.</P>

<P class="Para">Two principal methods are provided for securing
access to Alberta Credit by the population generally as individuals. One of the
means adopted for this purpose is designated the &quot;Consumers'
Dividend,&quot;&mdash;a monthly grant of Alberta credit to everybody falling within
the designation of &quot;persons entitled to Alberta credit,&quot; which
includes virtually everybody who is twenty-one years of age, a British subject,
resident and domiciled in Alberta, the amount of which is determined by the
Commission. The payment of these dividends is provided by Treasury Certificates
issued to each branch for the amount that branch has to disburse and the branch
issues credit vouchers to the recipients of the dividend in payment thereof.</P>

<P class="Para">The second method is by use of the retail
discount rate, which constitutes, perhaps, the cardinal feature of the</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 112]</P>

<P class="Para">statutory plan. This is a rebate by which
purchasers of goods and services are subsidized through a reduction of price
compensated by a corresponding credit to the retailer. It is applicable to
sales of goods and services to ultimate consumers by persons qualified to
&quot; dispense &quot; the discount. In order to qualify for this purpose, a
retailer must enter into an agreement with the Commission, one term of which,
if the Commission so requires, is that he will deal only with wholesalers and
primary producers who have entered into agreements with the Commission pursuant
to the provisions of the statute. The discount rate is fixed by the Commis&shy;sion
and is determined by the ratio of the money value of the &quot; unused
productive capacity &quot; of Alberta to the value of the total capacity.</P>

<P class="Para">For augmenting purchasing power, the principal
agency appears to be this retail discount rate. A subsidy in this form, by way
of reduction of price, it is, perhaps, assumed, will not be attended with the
same risk of consequen&shy;tial inflation as a direct subsidy to consumers;
especially as the rate, being fixed by reference to the ratio between the value
of unusued capacity for production and the value of total capacity may be
supposed to diminish with augmentation of production. A condition of the opera&shy;tion
of this device is, of course, the provision of some means for compensating the
seller for the reduction in price and, since the province of Alberta has no
legislative control over the creation of currency or legal tender or bank
credits, compensation in any of these forms would ordinarily be supplied by
means of taxation, or in other words, ulti&shy;mately from the pockets of people
living in Alberta or own&shy;ing property there. Such difficulties the statutory
plan proposes to avoid by the establishment of Alberta credit as a fund of credit
for employment, as we have seen, as a means of exchange and payment.</P>

<P class="Para">The statute recognizes that extra-provincial
debts will in most cases have to be paid in currency and declares that they
shall be so paid when desired by the &quot; other party&quot;; and certain
enactments of the statute appear to be intended to make provision for this. It
is recognized, in other words, that it would not be practicable for Alberta to
establish a system under which legal tender is wholly dispensed with.</P>

<P class="Para">As regards intra-provincial transactions,
authority is given to everybody to receive Alberta credit in payment of</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 113]</P>

<P class="Para">goods and services, but here again the
Legislature has ob&shy;viously recognized its lack of authority to make such
acceptance compulsory by direct legislative enactment. Never&shy;theless, it is
clear from the declarations above quoted, as well as from the statute as a
whole that the substitution generally in internal commerce of Alberta credit
for bank credit and legal tender as the circulating medium is of the very
essence of the plan.</P>

<P class="Para">The object being to provide increased purchasing
power, it is, as explained, of the essence of the scheme that this shall be
brought about, not by subsidizing consumers directly, but, mainly by a rebate
in prices through the appli&shy;cation of the retail discount rate. As that
necessarily involves the provision of some means for compensating the seller,
and since the compensation provided is compensa&shy;tion out of Alberta credit, it
is clear enough that this device could only be made practicable in connection
with transac&shy;tions where the price is paid in Alberta credit, and the discount
rate will itself, of course, be paid in the same way.</P>

<P class="Para">The practicability of the scheme, the
feasibility of it as a means of accomplishing the declared purpose of the
legislation, postulates, therefore, a willingness on the part of sellers of
goods and services, in Alberta transactions, to accept Alberta credit in
payment; in other words, acceptance generally in Alberta of Alberta credit as
the circulating medium.</P>

<P class="Para">The Credit House is, as already observed, the
agent of the Provincial Treasurer through which Alberta credit circulates. The
Credit House is to accept deposits of cur&shy;rency and securities, to transfer
credit, to receive deposits of credit vouchers and of transfers of Alberta
credit. It can convert currency and negotiable instruments on demand into
Alberta credit. It is to issue credit vouchers in payment of the consumers'
dividend. It is probably intended to issue discount vouchers. Alberta credit on
deposit with a branch may be drawn against by a cus&shy;tomer by means of any
instrument in the form prescribed by the Commission. The forms of credit
vouchers and discount vouchers and of transfers are to be settled by regulation
by the Commission.</P>

<P class="Para">It is expressly provided that a transfer of
credit becomes effective on delivery; that is to say, on presentment to a</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 114]</P>

<P class="Para">branch of the Credit House. In other words, it
is equiva&shy;lent to an order which is to be honoured on demand. Bankers' credit
may be described as the &quot; right to draw cheques on a bank &quot;; and the
practical exercise of this right involves either the transfer of credit to
another on the books of the same bank, or on the books of another bank, or
payment to the payee in legal tender at his dis&shy;cretion. A customer of the
Credit House has no right to require payment of legal tender at his discretion,
unless his ; deposit is a currency deposit, and cannot transfer such a right to
another, but, save in that respect, he is, and must necessarily be, if the
system is really to be operative, in relation to his account in the Credit
House, in the same position as the customer of a bank.</P>

<P class="Para">The question arises: Is legislation of this type
com&shy;petent to a province as within the ambit of Property and Civil Rights
within the Province (no. 13) or Matters merely local or private within the
Province (no. 16) ; or does the subject matter of it fall within the categories
of matters set apart by section 91 under the enumerated heads of that section
to be exclusively regulated and controlled by the central legislative authority
acting in behalf of the people of Canada as a whole?</P>

<P class="Para">The question thus stated puts a dilemma which is
not strictly complete because, of course, a subject matter of legislation,
though not within any of the enumerated heads of section 91, may still be
outside the ambit of section 92.</P>

<P class="Para">The whole of the two sections must be
considered; and, of course, in light of the judicial interpretation of them.
The second of the enumerated categories of section 91 is defined by the words
&quot; The Regulation of Trade and Com&shy;merce.&quot; The same section comprises
a number of other categories of subjects which in great part, at least, would,
if full scope were given to the words &quot;Regulation of Trade and
Commerce&quot; in their ordinary sense, fall under head no. 2. Among them are
Currency and Coinage (no. 14) ; Incorporation of Banks, Banking and the Issue
of Paper Money (no. 15) and Legal Tender (no. 20).</P>

<P class="Para">In respect of &quot; any matter coming within
any &quot; of these &quot; classes of subjects&quot; the authority of the
Parliament of Canada is &quot; exclusive &quot;; and &quot;legislation falling
strictly</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 115]</P>

<P class="Para">within any of the classes &quot; so enumerated
&quot; is not within the legislative competence of the provincial legislatures
under section 92&quot; (The <I>Fisheries
</I>case)<A href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[1]</SPAN></SPAN></A>.</P>

<P class="Para">Indeed, by the explicit words of the concluding
paragraph of section 91, &quot; any matter coming within any of &quot; these
&quot; classes of subjects shall not be deemed to come within the class of
matters of a local and private nature &quot; assigned exclusively to the
provinces. It is settled by the decision of the Privy Council in A.G. <I>for Ontario v. A.G. for Canada<A href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[2]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A> </I>(as interpreted in the <I>Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King<A href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[3]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>)
</I>that if a given subject-matter falls within any
class of subjects enumerated in section 91, &quot;it cannot be treated as
covered by any of those within sec&shy;tion 92.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">The general character of the classes of subjects
enumer&shy;ated in section 91, especially of those mentioned above (Trade and
Commerce, Currency and Coinage, Banks and Banking, Legal Tender), is important.
A comparison of the nature of these subjects with the subjects included in
section 92 seems to suggest that credit (including credit in this novel form)
as a medium for effecting the exchange of goods and services, and the machinery
for issuing and circulating it, are among the matters assigned to the Dominion
under section 91 and not among those intended to be assigned to the provinces
under any of the categories of section 92.</P>

<P class="Para">The categories (of s. 91) mentioned having been
com&shy;mitted for legislative action to Parliament, which repre&shy;sents the people
of Canada as a whole, we find it difficult to suppose that it could have been
intended, under the general headings Property and Civil Rights, Matters merely
local or private, that a single province might direct its powers of legislation
under section 92 to the introduction, maintenance and regulation of this novel
apparatus for all commercial, industrial and trading operations.</P>

<P class="Para">For our present purpose, we are, once again, not
in the least concerned with any question of the practicability of the scheme;
which will necessarily depend, as we have seen, upon the general acceptance, by
the people of Alberta, of</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 116]</P>

<P class="Para">Alberta credit as a medium of payment in
intra-provin&shy;cial transactions. In order to test the validity of the legis&shy;lation
we must, we think, envisage the plan in practice as the statute contemplates
it.</P>

<P class="Para">Our conclusion is that it is not within the
power of the province to establish statutory machinery with the functions for
which this machinery is designed and to regulate the operation of it. Weighty
reasons could be urged for the conclusion that, as subject matter of legisla&shy;tion,
in part at least, it comes within the field designated , by
&quot;Currency&quot; (no. 14 'of section 91). We think the machinery in its
essential components and features comes under head no. 15, Banks and Banking;
and if the legis&shy;lation is not strictly within the ambit of no. 14 or no. 15,
or partly in one and partly in the other, then we are satis&shy;fied that its
subject matter is embraced within category no. 2, Trade and Commerce, and
that it does not come within section 92.</P>

<P class="Para">First, as to banking. A banker has been defined
as &quot; a dealer in credit.&quot; True, in ordinary speech, bank credit
implies a credit which is convertible into money. But money as commonly
understood is not necessarily legal tender. Any medium which by practice
fulfils the function of money and which everybody will accept in payment of a debt is money in
the ordinary sense of the words even although it may not be legal tender; and
this statute envisages a form of credit which will ultimately, in Alberta,
acquire such a degree of confidence as to be generally acceptable, in the sense that
bank credit is now acceptable; and will serve as a substitute therefor.</P>

<P class="Para">Sections 31 and 33, which have been quoted
above, are most important in this connection.</P>

<P class="Para">Furthermore, sections 32, 34 and 35 (1) all
contemplate the maintenance and control of credit by operations which would
appear to be substantially banking operations.</P>

<P class="Para">It will be observed that full powers are vested
in the Commission to give effect to the general provisions of the Act by
regulation; and that, moreover, the Board is invested with authority to assist
any proposal calculated to
&quot; equate &quot; consumption with production; and,
further-more, that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, by sec&shy;tion 42, is
authorized, for the purpose of giving effect to</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 117]</P>

<P class="Para">the intent and purpose of the statute, upon the
request of the Board, to alter or supplement the provisions of the Act for the
purpose of providing for matters arising out of the operation of the Act for
which no provision is made, pro&shy;vided that such change is not contrary to the
policy of the Act. The &quot;policy&quot; of the Act, &quot;the intent and
purpose&quot; of the Act, are sufficiently stated in the declarations quoted
above.</P>

<P class="Para">Since the operation of the scheme will
necessarily depend upon the general employment of Alberta credit as a means of
exchange and payment, we think the argument advanced in Mr. Geoffrion's factum
is a sound one, that, as regards the forms of credit vouchers and discount
vouchers and transfers, and the administration of the Credit House and the
transaction of business as between the Credit House and its customers,
provision will presumably be made in exercise of these powers for facilitating
in as high degree as possible the use of Alberta credit for all the purposes of
trade and commerce within Alberta; and that the forms of dealing in credit,
which by long experience have commended themselves to the banking, financial
and commercial community as the most convenient, will be followed as far as
practic&shy;able. It is fair to infer, we think, that this is what the statute
contemplates.</P>

<P class="Para">In substance, we repeat, this system of
administration, management and circulation of credit (if, and in so far as it
does not fall under the denomination &quot; Currency &quot;) constitutes in our
view a system of &quot; banking &quot; within the intendment of section 91; and
the statute in our opinion is concerned with &quot; banking &quot; in that
sense.</P>

<P class="Para">There is, if the subject matter of the statute
is not strictly &quot; currency &quot; or &quot; banking,&quot; or both, an
alternative view of the character of it. Employing the words in their ordinary
sense and detached from their context in the <I>British North America Act, </I>nobody would hesitate to say that <I>The Alberta Social Credit Act is </I>concerned with &quot;trade and commerce.&quot; It provides the
machinery for a novel system of credit and contemplates the separation of
intra-provincial industry, commerce and trade from the existing system of
finance (in which bank credit and legal tender constitute the media of payment)
; and the conduct of industrial, commercial and trading activities by the
instrumentality </P>

<P class="Page">[Page 118]</P>

<P class="Para">of this new system of credit through this
statutory machinery; and this would appear to involve profound and far-reaching
changes in the operations of commerce and trade. In this connection the
comprehensive terms of section 36 (b) should be recalled. Any proposal reported
to the Board by the Commission pursuant to that section can, under the powers
of section 42, be given the force of statute by the Lieutenant-Governor in
Council, even though that should involve an amendment of the Act. These two
sections afford striking evidence of the penetrating and far-reaching character
of the activities of the Board and the Commission in relation to commerce,
industry and trade which the authors of the legislation had in view.</P>

<P class="Para">Such legislation, if not legislation in respect
of banking or currency, would appear to be concerned with the regula&shy;tion of
trade and commerce, rather than with property and civil rights or matters
merely local or private in the prov&shy;ince.</P>

<P class="Para">This brings us to the question: Is such a
classification forbidden by the context, or by any restriction imposed in
consequence of considerations derived from the enact&shy;ments and the declarations
of the B.N.A. Act as a whole?</P>

<P class="Para">In deciding this question, we must, of course,
consult the pronouncements of the Courts. It has been settled in a series of
decisions that the literal meaning of the words &quot; Regulation of Trade and
Commerce &quot; must be restricted</P>

<P class="Citation1">in order to afford scope for powers which
have been given exclusively to the provincial legislatures <I>(Bank of Toronto v. Lambe</I><A href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><I><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[4]</SPAN></B></I></SPAN></A><I>.</I></P>

<P class="Para">It will not be necessary to review these
decisions at length. The concrete questions there brought into controversy can
be briefly stated. They concerned the authority of the Dominion under section
91(2) to legislate in relation to local railways and undertakings, which are
specifically dealt with in section 91(29) and section 92(10) <I>(Montreal Street Railway </I>case)<A href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[5]</SPAN></SPAN></A> ; in
relation to the regulation of a par&shy;ticular business <I>(Insurance Reference)<A href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[6]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>; </I>in relation to a commission appointed by the Government of Canada
and empowered to make orders directed to particular traders in a given town
controlling them in respect of the prices of commodities offered by them for sale in such</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 119]</P>

<P class="Para">town (In <I>re Board of Commerce Act)<A href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[7]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>; </I>in relation to the public investigation of disputes between
individual employers and their workers and the prohibition of strikes and
lockouts pending such investigation <I>(Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider)<A href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[8]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.</I></P>

<P class="Para">These comprise the principal relevant decisions
prior to the judgment of the Privy Council in 1937 in re <I>Natural Products Marketing Act<A href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[9]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A> </I>to which we are about to refer; and if attention be directed to the
thing which was the actual subject of decision, rather than to what was said,
it will be found that they are completely and accurately summed up in the
observation of Lord Atkin in A.-G. <I>for B.C. v. A.-G. for Canada<A href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[10]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A></I> in these words:</P>

<P class="Citation1">the regulation of trade and commerce does
not permit the regulation of individual forms of trade or commerce confined to
the province.</P>

<P class="Para">In our opinion, there is no kind of analogy
between the legislation under review in any of these cases and <I>The Social Credit Act. </I>Neither the object of that Act, as stated in the explicit
declarations quoted, nor the effect of it, if it be operative, is the
regulation of any particular form of business, unless it is legislation on the
subject of banking. Nor does the statute attempt the regulation of particular
trades or of forms of trade or commerce through a general authority committed
to a single regulating body, as in the <I>Board of Commerce </I>case<A href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[11]</SPAN></SPAN></A> and in the <I>Reference re the Natural Products Marketing Act<SUP>5</SUP>.
</I>Nor is it a statute, such as the <I>Sales of Goods Act, </I>declaring the legal rights of parties in relation to trading or
commercial transactions. It attempts, as we have said, to effect a radical
reorganization of the whole system of trade and commerce within the province by
the substitution of a novel system of credit for the present financial system
under which the operations of trade, industry and commerce are now conducted.</P>

<P class="Para">Can it be said that this view ascribes to the
Regulation of Trade and Commerce a meaning and effect which unduly restricts
the ambit of the powers given under section 92&mdash;which fails, in the words quoted
above from the judgment in <I>Bank
of Toronto v. Lambe<A href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[12]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>,
</I>to</P>

<P class="Para">afford scope for powers
which are given exclusively to the provincial legislatures?</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 120]</P>

<P class="Para">The conclusion, we have already indicated, that
the subject matter of this legislation would appear more natur&shy;ally to fall
within category no. 2 of section 91 than within section 92 under either
Property and Civil Rights or Mat&shy;ters merely local and private, is fortified by
reference to the general nature of other classes of subjects assigned to the
Dominion. Assuming that the subject-matter does not fall within the more
specific categories mentioned (Banking and Currency), it is closely allied to such,
matters. We can see, we repeat, no reason for ascribing it to nos. 13 and 16 of
section 92. Where you have in the enumerated subdivisions of section 91
language which is apt for the designation of a particular matter, then you are
not entitled to exclude that matter from the category so defined in the absence
of some very cogent reason. The reason indicated above (the risk of unduly
restricting the scope of powers intended to be vested in the provinces) which led to the
exclusion from this category of the regula&shy;tion of individual forms of trade
and commerce, and of contracts in particular trades, and the regulation of the
relations of masters and servants, have no application here; because an
inspection of the structure and language of sections 91 and 92, and a
comparison of the subjects of the two sections, reveals no justification for
the assumption that the subject matter of this legislation belongs to any type
of matters which it could have been intended to commit to the legislative
jurisdiction of a single province.</P>

<P class="Para">We have discussed the principal decisions upon
the scope of head no. 2 of section 91. It remains to consider some observations
contained in the judgments in three, of those cases,&mdash;the M<I>on</I>t<I>real
Street Railway </I>case<A href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[13]</SPAN></SPAN></A>, the <I>Board of Commerce </I>case<A href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[14]</SPAN></SPAN></A> and <I>Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider<A href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[15]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>. </I>In the judgments in the two last-mentioned cases a view was
expressed which had been adumbrated in the first of them and which can be given
in a sentence from the judgment in <I>Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider<A href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[16]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.
</I>It is to this effect:</P>

<P class="Citation1">It is in their Lordships' opinion now clear
that excepting so far as the power can be invoked in aid of capacity conferred
independently under other words in s. 91, the power to regulate trade and
commerce</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 121]</P>

<P class="Para">cannot be relied on as
enabling the Dominion. Parliament to regulate civil rights in the provinces.</P>

<P class="Para">It is difficult, no doubt, to reconcile this
view with the concluding paragraph of section 91 already discussed;
nevertheless, in a judgment delivered in <I>Re the Natural Products Marketing Act<A href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[17]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A> </I>we unanimously expressed the opinion, and our judgment proceeded in
part, at least, upon the hypothesis, that we were bound by this pronouncement
in the judgment in <I>Snider's
</I>case<A href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[18]</SPAN></SPAN></A> and by
similar &mdash; pronouncements in the <I>Board of Commerce </I>case<A href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[19]</SPAN></SPAN></A>, as expressing the <I>ratio decidendi </I>of those decisions. It is clear now, however, from the reasons for
judgment in A.-G. <I>for
Ontario v. A.-G. for Canada<A href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[20]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>
</I>that the Regulation of Trade and Commerce must be
treated as having full independent status as one of the enumerated heads of
section 91. The judgment states, referring to the former <I>Trade Mark Act </I>of
1927, that it gave.</P>

<P class="Citation1">to the proprietor of a registered trade
mark the exclusive right to use the trade mark to designate articles
manufactured or sold by him. It creates, therefore, a form of property in each
province and the rights that flow therefrom. * * * If challenged one obvious
source of authority would appear to be the class of subjects enumerated in s.
91 (2), the Regulation of Trade and Commerce, referred to by the Chief Justice.
There could hardly be a more appropriate form of the exercise of this power
than the creation and regulation of a uniform law of trade marks.</P>

<P class="Para">This judgment recognizes the necessity of
keeping the actual language of sections 91 and 92 constantly in view in
applying the enactments of those sections. Paraphrases of the words of head no.
2 of section 91 have been found useful in particular cases for assigning to
that head a func&shy;tion in the scheme of these sections which would not result in
defeating one main purpose of the B.N.A. Act by sub&shy;stantially impairing the
autonomy of the provinces in respect of matters of purely provincial concern.
But such paraphrases were not framed in light of the possibility of such legislation
as that now before us. Such legislation was not in the minds of the great
judges who adopted them. And since in none of the cases was it strictly neces&shy;sary
to draw an abstract line fixing the limits of the category in question, these
formulae ought not to be treated as substitutes for the words of section 91,
when, as now, a totally new type of legislation has to be considered; </P>

<P class="Page">[Page 122]</P>

<P class="Para">in relation to which it would be extravagant to
suggest that any question of impairment of such autonomy arises.</P>

<P class="Para">It remains to add that the circumstance that the
statute operates only within the boundaries of the province is, in the view
expressed above, immaterial.</P>

<P class="Para">This Act, in common with <I>The Credit of Alberta Regula&shy;tion Act, </I>contains a section which it will be convenient to discuss here. It
is section 50 and is in these words:</P>

<P class="Citation1">No provision of this Act shall be so
construed as to authorize the doing of any act or thing which is not within the
legislative competence of the Legislative Assembly.</P>

<P class="Para">Speaking of similar provisions in <I>Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd.<A href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[21]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>, </I>Lord Sumner said:</P>

<P class="Citation1">In their Lordships' opinion the real
question is whether the Legis&shy;lature has actually interfered with interprovincial
or with foreign trade. The presence or absence of an express disclaimer of any
such interference may greatly assist where the language of the Provincial
Legislature does not in itself determine the question and define its effect.
If, however, it is otherwise clear that there is such an interference, or that
there is none and the language actually used sufficiently decides that
question, there is no such sovereign efficacy in such a clause as s. 72 as to
make its presence or absence in an enactment crucial.</P>

<P class="Para">Since, in our opinion, the substantive
enactments of the statute are <I>ultra vires </I>and the statute as a whole is
void as constituting an attempt to set up and provide for the regulation of the
machinery for a system of credit in the sense explained, s. 50 would appear, in
the view expressed by the Judicial Committee, to be of no significance, as
having nothing to operate upon.</P>

<P class="Para">Section 50 is of an entirely different character
from that in question in <I>A.G.
for Manitoba v. Manitoba License-holders Ass'n<A href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[22]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.</I></P>

<P class="Para">We come now to the bills submitted. The first to
be considered is Bill no. <I>8, </I><I>The Credit of Alberta Regula&shy;tion Act, 1937,&quot;</I></P>

<P class="Para">In view of what has already been said, this
statute is <I>ultra vires </I>on a narrow ground. It is a licensing statute, not in the sense that
it imposes taxation by way of licence, but in the sense that the licensing authority
is used for the purpose of regulating the institutions to which the statute
relates; that is the pith of it, and the licensing</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 123]</P>

<P class="Para">authorities are the Provincial Credit Commission
and the Social Credit Board, the commission and the board con&shy;stituted under <I>The Alberta Social Credit Act; </I>and the narrow point is this: In the view already expressed, <I>The Alberta Social Credit Act is ultra
vires. </I>The machinery it professes to constitute
cannot, therefore, come into opera&shy;tion. Consequently, <I>The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act </I>which can only take effect through that machinery must necessarily
be inoperative. Furthermore, it is quite plain, not only from the preamble of <I>The Credit of Alberta Regu&shy;lation Act, </I>but also from its enacting provisions, that it is a part of the
general scheme of legislation of which <I>The Alberta Social Credit Act is </I>really the basis; and that sta&shy;tute being <I>ultra vires, </I>ancillary
and dependent legislation falls with it.</P>

<P class="Para">The broader ground upon which we think this
legislation is <I>ultra vires
is this: </I>First, it is legislation in relation to
Banking. In the alternative, it is legislation in relation to the Regulaton [sic]
of Trade and Commerce within the meaning of section 91 (2) of <I>The British North America Act.</I></P>

<P class="Para">The statute contains no express definition of
&quot; credit.&quot; Nevertheless, the language itself in which the enactments
of the statute are expressed appears to afford indicia from which it is not
difficult to ascertain the kind of credit the statute contemplates. First, we have
the declaration that a &quot; credit institution &quot; is a person or
corporation whose business or ,any part of whose business is the business of
dealing in credit. The credit we are concerned with, therefore, is something
which is dealt with as part of a business.</P>

<P class="Para">Then, by clause (b), a business of this kind
consists in transactions whereby such &quot; credit is created, issued, lent *
* * provided * * * by means of book-keeping entries &quot; or &quot; dealt in
&quot; by such means. Further, the credit is of such a character that these
transactions occur in rela&shy;tion to it: &quot; the payment of cheques (which
have been) made, drawn or paid in by customers,&quot; the payment of other
negotiable instruments which have been similarly dealt with by customers and
&quot; the making of advances and the granting of overdrafts.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">We are concerned, for the present, with
'ascertaining the effect of clause (a) and of clause (b) minus the last member.</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 124]</P>

<P class="Para">Perhaps it is convenient at the outset to refer
to the recital which is in these words:</P>

<P class="Para">Whereas the extent to
which property and civil rights in the province may be enjoyed depends upon the
principles governing the monetization of credit and the means whereby such
credit is made available to the province and to the People collectively and
individually of the province.</P>

<P class="Para">&quot;Monetization of credit&quot; does not seem
to be a very precise expression, but it does point to the conclusion that the
credit with which the statute is concerned is credit in a form in which it can
be employed for the purposes of money.</P>

<P class="Para">Now, the language of clause (b), excluding, of
course, the last member, is perfectly sensible as applied to bank credit. A
banker is a dealer in credit. Bank credit has, in ordinary usage, the meaning
which is ascribed to it in the following paragraph in the chapter on the
Creation of Credit in the late Mr. Walter Leaf's volume on Banking in the Home
University Library, a chapter added in the last edition by Mr. Ernest Sykes,
secretary to the Institute of Bankers:</P>

<P class="Citation1">The word credit is used in a variety of
meanings between which it is not at the moment necessary to distinguish.
Suffice it to say that when the creation of credit is discussed there is
general agreement that by credit is meant banker's credit, that is to say, the
right to draw cheques on a bank. The exercise of this right involves either the
withdrawal from the bank of legal tender, in the shape of bank notes or silver
and bronze coin, or the transfer of such a right to some other person in the
books of the same or another bank.</P>

<P class="Para">In a well-known book, published in 1890
(Macleod, Theory of Credit, p. 368-9), it is said:</P>

<P class="Citation1">When a customer pays in money into his
account in the usual way of business, he sells it to the banker. * * *</P>

<P class="Citation1">In exchange for the money the banker makes
an entry of an equal sum in credit in favour of his customer. And it is the
entry to the credit of the customer which, in the technical language of modern
banking is termed a deposit * * *</P>

<P class="Citation1">So when a banker discounts a bill for a
customer he buys it exactly in the same way as he bought money from his
customer. He creates a credit in his books in favour of his customer. And this
credit created to purchase the bill is termed a deposit equally as the credit
created to purchase the money * * * A deposit is simply a credit in the
banker's books. It is the evidence of the right of action which a customer has
to demand a sum of money from the banker. As soon as the banker has created a
credit, or deposit, in his books in favour of a customer he has issued to him a
right of action against himself.</P>

<P class="Para">It is needless to say, perhaps, that we are not
in the least concerned here with controversies about the creation</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 125]</P>

<P class="Para">of credit by bankers, touching the limits of the
power of bankers in this respect, and the conditions to which the power is
subject. Everybody concedes that bankers do create credit in the sense of the
paragraphs just quoted. Moreover, it is not in conflict with usage to speak of
such credit being &quot; credit created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in by
means of book-keeping entries.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">Such language, properly understood, not
incorrectly describes the practice followed in banking transactions. Speaking
generally, bank credit transferable on demand and so available for commercial
purposes is evidenced by book-keeping entries, and it is upon the evidence, and
authority of such entries that the banker and his employees daily and hourly
act in the business of the bank. Such entries are for practical purposes the
record as well as the evidence of the creation, of bank credit and it is by
means of them that such credit as a medium of payment and exchange is
transferred, disbursed and dealt in.</P>

<P class="Para">Then, the 'transactions enumerated in the second
member of the clause are all defined as transactions relating to &quot; credit
created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in by means of book-keeping entries
&quot; in course of the business of deal&shy;ing in credit. In this country, the
functions of temporary lending and the provision of transferable credits as a
means of payment are performed together as a matter of course.</P>

<P class="Para">But it is important to emphasize that, while the
payment of customers' cheques and other negotiable instru&shy;ments and the making
of advances and the granting of overdrafts are enumerated in the second member
of the clause, they are all transactions having relation to some &quot; credit
created * * * or dealt in by means of book-keeping entries.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">The essential feature of the business of dealing
in credit, therefore, is, by this definition, the creation of credits and the
dealing in credits by means of book-keeping entries and these related
transactions. It should be noted also that, from the persons carrying on the
business of dealing in credits so defined is excepted the Bank of Canada; and
clause (b), with the last member left out of consideration, has unquestionably
the effect of designating transactions which are the transactions of somebody
who is carrying</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 126]</P>

<P class="Para">on business in banking. We are unable to read
this language as extending to transactions which are not of that character. It
was suggested that the transactions of a bill broker or a person engaged in
discounting bills or making advances on the credit of bills or promissory notes
would fall within it, but this leaves entirely out of account the all important
limitation that the business of dealing in credit, by definition, is the
business of somebody who is engaged in transactions of the kind specified but
with the qualification that such transactions are effectuated by means of
&quot;book-keeping entries.&quot; Such language, properly understood, finds, as
we have seen, a reasonable application in designating the transactions of a
banker but, so far as we are aware, it has no application to the business of a
bill broker or to that of a money lender who is not a banker.</P>

<P class="Para">It should be observed that the statute applies
only to credit institutions which are carrying on business when the Act comes
into force, that is, when assented to.</P>

<P class="Para">We come now to the final member expressed in
these words :</P>

<P class="Citation1">but does not include transactions which are
banking within the meaning of the word &quot;bang&quot; as used in subhead 15
of section 91 of <I>The </I><I>British North America
Act, </I>1867.</P>

<P class="Para">We repeat, clause (b) consists of a single
sentence con&shy;taining what professes to be a definition of &quot; business of
dealing in credit &quot; as employed in the statute. The words just quoted are
part of that definition. If effect is given to them, they completely destroy
everything which precedes them in that definition. They reduce the definition
to the single proposition that the &quot; business of dealing in credit &quot;
in the Act &quot;does not include transactions which are banking within the
meaning of the word ` banking' as used in sub&#8209;head 15 of section 91 of <I>The British, North America Act, </I><I>1867.&quot;</I></P>

<P class="Para">We have come to the conclusion that we have here
one of those cases in which there is a repugnancy of such a character that the
last words, if any effect is to be given them, really empty the clause of all
meaning ,as a definition and the statute of its intended effect and must be
disregarded. <I>(The Case of
Alton Woods<A href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[23]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>
; Clelland v. Ker<A href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[24]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>,
</I>and <I>Drury 227).</I></P>

<P class="Page">[Page 127]</P>

<P class="Para">If we should be wrong in this view of the
construction of section 2(b), in other words, if, giving full effect to the
last sentence, there is still some content left in the phrase &quot; business
of dealing in credit &quot; then the subject-matter of the statute would appear
to be within the category Regu&shy;lation of Trade and Commerce within the meaning
of section 91(2). We think it plain that &quot; credit &quot; (if not strictly
confined to bank credit) here means credit which is dealt in as bank credit is
dealt in, not such a credit, for example, as is created by a purchase of goods
on credit in the ordinary course of business, but credit which is created, issued
and so forth for the purpose of being dealt with as such.</P>

<P class="Para">In our opinion, legislation regulating credit
from the aspect and with the purpose disclosed by the provisions of the statute
as .a whole, read in light of the preamble and of the cognate statutes and
bills, (if it is not banking legislation) is legislation respecting matters which
fall strictly within Trade and Commerce and not within any of the matters
contemplated as subjects of provincial legislation within the meaning of
section 92.</P>

<P class="Para">Section 7 of the statute is, in terms, identical
with section 50 of the Social Credit Act and the observations with regard to
that section apply equally to section 7.</P>

<P class="Para">The answer, therefore, to the question
concerning this Bill is that it is <I>ultra vires.</I></P>

<P class="Para">The next Bill to be considered is that
respecting the Taxation of Banks: The question to be determined in relation to
this Bill is this: Is it an enactment in exercise of the provincial power to
raise a revenue for provincial purposes by direct taxation, or is it
legislation which, in its true character, relates to Incorporation of Banks and
Banking.</P>

<P class="Para">The judgment of the Judicial Committee in <I>Union Col&shy;liery Co. of B.C., Ltd. v. Bryden.<A href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[25]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A> </I>is sufficient authority for the proposition that the answer to this
question is to be found by ascertaining the effect of the legislation in the
known circumstances to which it is to be applied.</P>

<P class="Para">The rate of taxation is an annual rate of
one-half of one per cent on the paid-up capital and one per cent upon the
amount of the reserves as well as upon the amount of the</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 128]</P>

<P class="Para">undivided profits. It is proper, we think, to test
the effect of the legislation by considering the case of a bank&mdash;the Bank of
Montreal, for example&mdash;which carries on business in every province of Canada as
well as in many other places in North America and elsewhere.</P>

<P class="Para">The population of Alberta, in round numbers, is
800,000 and that of the Dominion, in round numbers, 10,000,000. The ratio of
the first figure to the second is expressed by the fraction two twenty-fifths.
It is not, we think, for our present purposes an inaccurate assumption that the
volume of business carried on by such a bank in Alberta would bear a ratio to
the total business of the bank in Canada not materially greater than the ratio
of the Alberta population to the population of the Dominion. The annual tax,
therefore, in the case of such a bank of one-half of one per cent upon the
paid-up capital may be regarded as a charge upon two twenty-fifths of its total
business; and, in respect of its reserves and undivided profits, one per cent,
borne by the same part of its business. Indeed, it is pretty obvious that the
fraction two twenty-fifths expresses a considerably higher ratio than a figure
strictly in accord with the facts. This would appear to give a fair and
reasonable point of view for obtaining a just idea of the practical effect of such
taxation.</P>

<P class="Para">It is plain, of course, that if such a bank were
subjected to such a levy in each of the provinces but on a scale varying with
the business done in the province, or the population of the province, the total
levy charged upon its business throughout the Dominion would amount to an
annual im&shy;post of six and one-quarter per cent upon its paid-up capital and
twelve and one-half per cent upon each of the other funds&mdash;the reserves and the
undivided profits.</P>

<P class="Para">In our opinion, it requires no demonstration to
show that such a rate of taxation must be prohibitive in fact and must be known
to the Alberta legislature to be prohibitive. It is our duty, as judges, to
take judicial notice of facts which are known to intelligent persons generally;
and any suggestion that the profits of banking as carried on in Canada could be
such as to enable banks to pay taxes to the provinces of such magnitude, having
regard to the other burdens, such as municipal rates, which are levied</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 129]</P>

<P class="Para">upon them in Canada, as well as the taxes paid
in foreign countries, would be incontinently rejected by anybody possessing the
most rudimentary acquaintance with affairs.</P>

<P class="Para">Now, this tax upon banks is of proportions which
have no parallel in the Alberta system of taxation. In the same year there was
a substantial increase in the taxes levied upon corporations generally,
including banks. This levy now in question which was imposed later is directed
exclu&shy;sively against banks.</P>

<P class="Para">Such legislation, in effect prohibitive,
although in form relating to taxation is, in truth, legislation &quot; directed
to,&quot; to quote the phrase of Lord Haldane in <I>Wharton's </I>case<A href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[26]</SPAN></SPAN></A>, controlling the banks in the conduct of
their busi&shy;ness, by forcing upon them !a discontinuance of business, or
otherwise. Such legislation, notwithstanding its form, is not within the powers
of the provinces under section 92 because its subject-matter in truth is the
Incorpora&shy;tion of Banks and Banking, one of the enumerated heads of section 91
(no. 15). The concluding paragraph of sec&shy;tion 91 is explicit.</P>

<P class="Citation1">Their Lordships made reference to the
circumstance that the con&shy;cluding words of s. 91 of <I>The British North
America Act, </I><I>&quot;Any </I>matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in.
this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local
or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by
this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces,&quot;
render it necessary to do more than ascertain whether the subject-matter in question
apparently falls within any of the heads of s. 92. As is now well settled the
words quoted apply, not only to the merely local or private matters in the
province referred to in head 16 of s. 92, but to the whole of the sixteen heads
in that section: A.-G. <I>for Ontario v. A.-G. for Canada<A href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;

<P class="Para">This is the language of the Judicial Committee
in <I>Great </I><I>West </I><I>Saddlery
Co. v. The King<A href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[28]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.</I></P>

<P class="Para">The chartered banks in Alberta exercise their
powers under the authority of a Dominion statute, the <I>Bank Act. </I>By
that statute, a system of banking is set up by the Parlia&shy;ment of Canada and
provision is made for the incorpora&shy;tion of individual banks which, on
compliance with the statutory conditions, are entitled to carry on business sub&shy;ject
to the provisions of the statute. This system of bank&shy;ing has been created by the
Parliament of Canada in exercise </P>

<P class="Page">[Page 130]</P>

<P class="Para">of its plenary and exclusive authority in
relation to that subject, and any legislation by a province which, to quote
again the phrase of Lord Haldane, is &quot;so directed by the provincial
legislatures&quot; as either directly or indirectly to frustrate the intention
of the <I>Bank Act </I>by preventing banks carrying on their business or controlling them
in the exercise of their powers must be invalid <I>(G. W. </I><I>Saddlery </I><I>v. </I><I>The King<A href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[29]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>).</I></P>

<P class="Para">This view of the effect of the legislation is
greatly strengthened by the obvious relation of the Bill to the scheme of
legislation to which the other Bills already discussed belong. This relation
between the Bill in question and the Social Credit legislation as a whole
enables us in some degree to understand a measure which would otherwise be
simply incomprehensible.</P>

<P class="Para">There are two other points to which we think it
advis&shy;able to refer briefly. As regards the excessive magnitude of the tax, the
question may be asked: Where are you to draw the line? The answer to that is,
any attempt to draw an abstract line is difficult and, in dealing with ques&shy;tions
of the kind before us, it is inadvisable to attempt it unless it be absolutely
necessary. This case presents no such necessity. It is plain on the face of the
Bill that the purpose of it is not to raise a revenue for provincial purposes,
and equally plain that taxation of this character throughout Canada, if
operative, would completely frus&shy;trate the purposes of the <I>Bank Act.</I></P>

<P class="Para">The next point concerns the decision of the
Judicial Committee in the <I>Bank
of Toronto v. Lambe<A href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[30]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.
</I>In that case counsel on behalf of the bank strongly
pressed upon their Lordships the view upon which the Supreme Court of the
United States acted in a series of cases <I>(McCulloch v. Maryland<A href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[31]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A> ; Osborn v. United States
Bank<A href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[32]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>
; Railroad Co. v. Peniston<A href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[33]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>)
</I>that since, in the words of the famous dictum of Chief
Justice Marshall &quot;the power to tax involves the power to destroy,&quot;
the states must be held to be deprived of the power to tax the instru&shy;mentalities
of the Federal government.</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 131]</P>

<P class="Para">Their Lordships declined to apply this principle
of inter&shy;pretation to <I>The
British North America Act </I>partly, it would appear,
on the ground that the legislation of the provinces is subject to control by
the Dominion through the power of disallowance. But the tax there in question
had no sort of resemblance to that we are now considering and the question now
before us did not there arise. Taxation of such a magnitude as to crush banks
out of existence was put as a bare possibility and their Lordships declined to
hold that such a possibility was sufficient for denying the provinces the power
to exercise the right of taxation in a legitimate way.</P>

<P class="Para">In <I>Caron v. The King<A href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[34]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>,
</I>Lord Phillimore, speaking on behalf of the Judicial
Committee, quoted with approval a passage from the judgment of Davies C.J.
(then Davies J.) in <I>Abbott
v. City of Saint John<A href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[35]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>
</I>in these words:</P>

<P class="Citation1">The province does not attempt to interfere
directly with the exercise of the Dominion power, but merely says that, when
exercised, the recipients of the salaries shall be amenable to provincial
legislation in like manner as all other residents * * * It is said the
legislature might authorize an income tax denuding a Dominion official of a
tenth or even a fifth of his official income, and, in this way, paralyse the
Dominion service and impair the efficiency of the service. But it must be borne
in mind that the law does not provide for a special tax on Dominion officials but
for a general undiscriminatory tax upon the incomes of residents and that
Dominion officials could only be taxed upon their incomes in the same ratio and
proportion as other residents. At any rate, if, under the guise of exercising
power of taxation, confiscation of a substantial part of official and other
salaries were attempted, it would be then time enough to consider the question
and not to assume beforehand such a suggested misuse of the power.</P>

<P class="Para">The judgment proceeds:</P>

<P class="Citation1">In <I>Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King<A href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[36]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A> </I>provincial legisla&shy;tion,
which had the effect of precluding Dominion trading companies from carrying on
their business in the Province unless they complied with certain special terms,
was held ultra vires, as calculated to abrogate the capacity or derogate from
the status which it was in the power of the Parliament of Canada to bestow; and
,a general principle was laid down that no provincial Legislature could use its
special powers as an indirect means of destroying powers given by the Parliament
of Canada.</P>

<P class="Citation1">By parity of reason the Parliament of
Canada could not exercise its power of taxation so as to destroy the capacity
of officials lawfully appointed by the Province.</P>

<P class="Para">The specific ground on which, in our opinion,
this legis&shy;lation is invalid is: It is not competent to the provinces of
Canada, by the exercise of their powers of taxation, to</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 132]</P>

<P class="Para">force banks which are carrying on business under
the authority of the Bank Act to discontinue business; and taxation by one
province on a scale which, in a practical business sense, is manifestly
prohibitive is not a valid exercise of provincial legislative authority under
section 92. Such legislation, though in the form of a taxing statute, is &quot;
directed to &quot; the frustration of the system of banking established by the
Bank Act, and to the controlling of banks in the conduct of their business.</P>

<P class="Para">The answer, therefore, to the question
concerning this, Bill is that it is <I>ultra vires.</I></P>

<P class="Para">We now turn to Bill No. 9.</P>

<P class="Para">This Bill contains two substantive provisions. Both
of them impose duties upon newspapers published in Alberta which they are
required to perform on the demand of &quot; the Chairman,&quot; who is, by the
interpretation clause, the Chairman of &quot; the Board constituted by section
3 of <I>The Alberta Social
Credit Act.&quot;</I></P>

<P class="Para">The Board, upon the acts of whose Chairman the
opera&shy;tion of this statute depends, is, in point of law, a non-existent body
(there is, in a word, no &quot; board &quot; in existence &quot; constituted by
section 3 of <I>The Alberta
Social Credit Act &quot;) </I>and both of the substantive
sections, sections 3 and 4, are, therefore, inoperative. The same, indeed, may
be said of sections 6 and 7 which are the enactments creating sanctions. It
appears to us, furthermore, that this Bill is a part of the general scheme of
Social Credit legislation, the basis of which is <I>The Alberta Social Credit Act; </I>the Bill presupposes, as a condition of its operation, that <I>The </I><I>Alberta Social Credit Act is </I>validly enacted; and, since that Act is <I>ultra vires, </I>the
ancillary and dependent legis&shy;lation must fall with it.</P>

<P class="Para">This is sufficient for disposing of the question
referred to us but, we think, there are some further observations upon the Bill
which may properly be made.</P>

<P class="Para">Under the constitution established by <I>The British North America Act, </I>legislative power for Canada is .vested in one Parliament consisting
of the Sovereign, an upper house styled the Senate, and the House of Commons.
Without entering in detail upon an. examination of the enactments</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 133]</P>

<P class="Para">of the Act relating to the House of Commons, it
can be said that these provisions manifestly contemplate a House of Commons
which is to be, as the name itself implies, a representative body; constituted,
that is to say, by mem&shy;bers elected by such of the population of the united
prov&shy;inces as may be qualified to vote. The preamble of the statute, moreover,
shows plainly enough that the consti&shy;tution of the Dominion is to be similar in
principle to that of the United Kingdom. The statute contemplates a parliament
working under the influence of public opinion and public discussion. There can
be no controversy that such institutions derive their efficacy from the free
public discussion of affairs, from criticism and answer and counter-criticism,
from attack upon policy and administration and defence and counter-attack; from
the freest and fullest analysis and examination from every point of view of
political proposals. This is signally true in respect of the discharge by
Ministers of the Crown of their responsi&shy;bility to Parliament, by members of
Parliament of their duty to the electors, and by the electors themselves of
their responsibilities in the election of their representatives.</P>

<P class="Para">The right of public discussion is, of course,
subject to legal restrictions; those based upon considerations of decency and public
order, and others conceived for the protection of various private and public
interests with which, for example, the laws of defamation and sedition are
concerned. In a word, freedom .of discussion means, to quote the words of Lord
Wright in <I>James v. Commonwealth<A href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[37]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>, &quot; </I>freedom governed by law.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">Even within its legal limits, it is liable to
abuse and grave abuse, and such abuse is constantly exemplified before our
eyes; but it is axiomatic that the practice of this right .of free public
discussion of public affairs, notwithstanding its incidental mischiefs, is the
breath of life for parliamentary institutions.</P>

<P class="Para">We do not doubt that (in addition to the power
of disallowance vested in the Governor General) the Parliament of Canada
possesses authority to legislate for the protec&shy;tion of this right. That
authority rests upon the principle that the powers requisite for the protection
of the constitution </P>

<P class="Page">[Page 134]</P>

<P class="Para">itself arise by necessary implication from <I>The British North America Act as </I>a whole <I>(Fort
Frances Pulp &amp; Power Co. Ltd. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. Ltd.<A href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[38]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A></I>) ; and since the subject-matter in relation to which the power is
exercised is not exclusively a provincial matter, it is necessarily vested in
Parliament.</P>

<P class="Para">But this by no means exhausts the matter. Any attempt
to abrogate this right of public debate or to suppress the traditional forms of
the exercise of the right (in public meeting and through the press) would, in
our opinion, be incompetent to the legislatures of the provinces, or to the
legislature of any one of the provinces, as repugnant to the provisions of <I>The British North America Act, </I>by which the Parliament of Canada is established as the legislative
organ of the people of Canada under the Crown, and Dominion legislation enacted
pursuant to the legisla&shy;tive authority given by those provisions. The subject
matter of such legislation could not be described as a pro&shy;vincial matter
purely; as in substance exclusively a matter of property and civil rights
within the province, or a matter private or local within the province. It would
not be, to quote the words of the judgment of the Judicial Com&shy;mittee in <I>Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King<A href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[39]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>, </I>&quot;legislation directed solely to the purposes specified in
section 92 &quot;; and it would be invalid on the principles enunciated in that
judgment and adopted in <I>Caron
v. The King<A href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[40]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.</I></P>

<P class="Para">The question, discussed in argument, of the
validity of the legislation before us, considered as a wholly indepen&shy;dent
enactment having no relation to the <I>Alberta Social Credit Act, </I>presents no little difficulty. Some degree of regulation of
newspapers everybody would concede to the provinces. Indeed, there is a very
wide field in which the provinces undoubtedly are invested with legislative
author&shy;ity over newspapers; but the limit, in our opinion, is reached when the
legislation effects such a curtailment of the exercise of the right of public
discussion as substantially to interfere with the working of the parliamentary
insti&shy;tutions of Canada as contemplated by the provisions of <I>The British North America Act </I>and the statutes of the</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 135]</P>

<P class="Para">Dominion of Canada. Such a limitation is
necessary, in our opinion, &quot;in order,&quot; to adapt the words quoted
above from the judgment in <I>Bank
of Toronto v. Lambe<A href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[41]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>
</I>&quot;to afford scope &quot; for the working of
such parliamentary institutions. In this region of constitutional practice, it
is not permitted to a provincial legislature to do indirectly what cannot be
done directly <I>(Great West Saddlery
Co. v. The King<A href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[42]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>).</I></P>

<P class="Para">Section <I>129 of The British North America Act is </I>in these words:</P>

<P class="Citation1">129. Except as otherwise provided by this
Act, all Laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, at the Union,
,and all Courts of Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction, and all legal Commissions,
Powers, and Authorities, and all Officers, Judicial, Administrative, and
Ministerial, existing therein at the Union, shall continue in Ontario, Quebec,
Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick respectively, as if the Union had not been made;
subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as are enacted by or exist
under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), to be repealed, abolished, or
altered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the respective
Province, according to the Authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature
under this Act.</P>

<P class="Para">The law by which the right of public discussion
is pro&shy;tected existed at the time <I>of </I>the enactment of <I>The British North America Act </I>and, as far as Alberta is concerned, at the date on which the
Alberta Act came into force, the 1st of September, 1905. In our opinion (on the
broad principle of the cases mentioned which has been recognized as limiting
the scope of general words defining the legislative authority of the Dominion)
the Legislature of Alberta has not the capacity under section 129 to alter that
law by legislation .obnoxious to the principle stated.</P>

<P class="Para">The legislation now under consideration
manifestly places in the hands of the Chairman of the Social Credit Commission
autocratic powers which, it may well be thought, could, if arbitrarily wielded,
be employed to frus&shy;trate in Alberta these rights of the Crown and the people
of Canada as a whole. We do not, however, find it neces&shy;sary to express an
opinion upon the concrete question whether or not this particular measure is
invalid as exceed&shy;ing the limits indicated above.</P>

<P class="Para">The answer to the question concerning this Bill
is that it is <I>ultra vires.</I></P>

<P class="Page">[Page 136]</P>

<P class="Para">CANNON J.&mdash;The first question referred to us by His Excellency the Governor General
in Council is :</P>

<P class="Para">Is Bill No. 1 entitled <I>&quot;An Act Respecting the Taxa&shy;tion of
Banks&quot; </I>or any of the provisions thereof and in
what particular or particulars or to what extent <I>intra vires </I>of the
legislature of the province of Alberta?</P>

<P class="Para">This bill provides that every bank which
transacts busi&shy;ness in the province of Alberta shall annually pay to His
Majesty for the use of the province, in addition to any tax payable pursuant to
any other Act, the following taxes, namely:</P>

<P class="Citation1">(a) a tax of one-half of one per centum on
the paid-up capital thereof;</P>

<P class="Citation1">(b) a tax of one per centum on the reserve
fund and undivided profits thereof.</P>

<P class="Para">It is claimed :</P>

<P class="Indent1">1. That the tendency of the tax is that it
shall be passed on and is in reality an attempt to impose a tax on the paid up
capital and reserves and profits throughout Canada and abroad and, therefore,
is not &quot;direct taxation within the province&quot; ;</P>

<P class="Indent1">2. The proposed taxation would destroy or
nullify the status and capacity of the banks which are Dominion corporations;</P>

<P class="Indent1">3. Taxation of the character in question, if
within provincial competence and adopted by all provinces would strike at the
very solvency of the banks and their ability to return moneys deposited with
them.</P>

<P class="Para">The extraordinary expansion given to the
recognized power of the provinces to levy direct tax for local purposes since
the decision of the Privy Council in <I>Bank of Toronto </I><I>v. </I><I>Lambe<A href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[43]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>,

</I>must be be reviewed in order to decide the
question.</P>

<P class="Para">In <I>Bank of Toronto v. Lambe<SUP>43</SUP>, </I>the
Privy Council said at pp. 586-587:</P>

<P class="Citation1">Then it is suggested that the legislature
may lay on taxes so heavy as to crush a bank out of existence, and so to
nullify the power</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 137]</P>

<P class="Citation1">of parliament to erect banks. But their
Lordships cannot conceive that when the Imperial Parliament conferred wide
powers of local self-government on great countries such as Quebec, it intended
to limit them on the speculation that they would be used in an injurious
manner. People who are trusted with the great power of making laws for property
and civil rights may well be trusted to levy taxes. There are obvious reasons
for confining their power to direct taxes and licences, because <I>the power of
indirect taxation would be felt all over the Dominion. </I>But whatever power
falls within the legitimate meaning of classes 2 and 9, is, in their Lordships'
judgment, what the Imperial Parliament intended to give; and to place a limit
on it because the power may be used unwisely, as all powers may, would be an
error, and would lead to insuperable difficulties, in the construction of the
Federation Act.</P>

<P class="Citation1">Their Lordships have been invited to take a
very wide range on this part of the case, .and to apply to the construction of
the Federation Act the principles laid down for the United States by Chief
Justice Marshall. Every one would gladly accept the guidance of that great
judge in a parallel ease. But he was dealing with the constitution of the
United States. Under that constitution, as their Lordships understand, each
state may make laws for itself, uncontrolled by the federal power, and subject
only to the limits placed by law on the range of subjects within its
jurisdiction. In such a constitution Chief Justice Marshall found one of those
limits at the point at which the action of the state legislature came into
conflict with the power vested in Congress. The appellant invokes that
principle to support the conclusion that the Federation Act must be so
construed as to allow no power to the provincial legislatures under section 92,
which may by possibility, and if exercised in some extravagant way, interfere
with the objects of the Dominion in exercising their powers under section 91.
It is quite impos&shy;sible to argue from the one case to the other. Their
Lordships have to construe the express words of an Act of Parliament which
makes an elaborate distribution of the whole field of legislative authority
between two legislative bodies, and at the same time provides for the federated
provinces a carefully balanced constitution, under which no one of the parts
can pass laws for itself except under the control of the whole acting through
the Governor-General. And the question they have to answer is whether the one
body or the other has power to make a given law. If they find that on the due
construction of the Act a legislative power falls within section 92, it would
be quite wrong of them to deny its existence because by some possibility it may
be abused, or may limit the range which otherwise would be open to the Dominion
parliament.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">In the <I>Forbes </I>case<A href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[48]</SPAN></SPAN></A>, I urged that the whole question should be
reconsidered and I gave some reasons why pro&shy;vincial interference with the
exclusive federal power of fix&shy;ing the salaries of Dominion civil servants
could not be upheld. I said, at page 75:</P>

<P class="Citation1">Can it be denied that, under existing, conditions
in Canada since the war, the reduction of the salaries of Dominion employees in
proportion to the needs of the provinces or municipalities, which in some cases
are very great and are increasing alarmingly, would, if added to</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 138]</P>

<P class="Citation1">the reductions imposed by the Dominion
Parliament, amount to con&shy;fiscation of a substantial part thereof and would as
a necessary consequence seriously impair the efficiency, <I>morale </I>and
economic independence of the national service? It is a patent fact to anyone
conversant with Canadian conditions, and any attempt by a Province to
confiscate, even in part, the stipend fixed by Parliament, whatever name may be
given to the operation, under whatever disguise it may be presented, is an
unauthorized assumption of a power which is essentially national in its scope
and operation and is expressly denied to the Province by the last phrase of
section 91. The Dominion alone can fix the salaries; and once fixed, they
cannot be changed or reduced by the Province. According to elementary common
sense, without the necessity of recourse to learned legal distinctions or
disquisitions, a salary minus a tax of 2, 5 or 10 per cent is a reduced salary <I>pro
tanto. </I>Such reduction in the case of Dominion servants can be effected by
Parliament only in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction under head (8) of
91. Now the respondent contends that the Act contemplates and contains such an
interference.</P>

<P class="Para">The majority of this Court and the Judicial
Committee refused to reconsider the conclusions reached about this power of
taxation in the cases of <I>Abbott
v. City of Saint John<A href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[49]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>

</I>I quote the follow&shy;ing from the judgment of My Lord

<P class="Citation1">The trial judge was Mr. Justice Moss<SUP>52</SUP>

<P class="Citation2">* * * there is no express constitutional

<P class="Para">Mr. Justice Moss
himself proceeds:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation2">In. this case the central authority, in the

<P class="Page">[Page 139]</P>

<P class="Para">provide. I do not find
in the British North America Act that there is any express constitutional
prohibition against the Local Legisla&shy;tures taxing such a salary, but I think
that upon the principles thus summarized in the case which I have just cited
there is neces&shy;sarily an implication that such power is not vested in the Local
Legislature.</P>

<P class="Citation1">The learned judges in the Court of Appeal

</I>four of the five judges of this Court were clearly, of the view that this

powers vested in the provinces by <I>The British North America Act. </I>Davies

<P class="Citation1">Time and again the Judicial Committee have

course, with the highest respect for the eminent judges who took part in it,&mdash;no
longer afford a guide to the interpretation of the <I>British North America
Act.</I></P>

<P class="Citation1"><I>Abbott v. City of Saint John<SUP>55</SUP>
</I>was approved in <I>Caron v. The King<A href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[58]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A></I> and both decisions
are, of course, binding upon this Court.</P>

<P class="Para">In the same case of <I>Forbes v. Attorney-General of Manitoba<A href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[59]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A> </I>Lord Macmillan, speaking for the Privy Council, answering the
argument that if the provincial authorities can tax at 2 per&shy;cent the salary
which a federal employee receives from the Dominion to enable him to live in
the province and discharge his duties there, they can tax his salary to such an
extent as to render it impossible for him to live and perform his duties, says
that a similar argument in terrorem was advanced and rejected in the case of <I>Bank of Toronto v. Lambe<A href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[60]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A> </I>and adopts Lord Hobhouse's dictum that self-governing provinces who
are entrusted with the great power of making laws for property and civil rights
may well be trusted to levy taxes.</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 140]</P>

<P class="Para">I would also refer to the case of the <I>Saskatchewan Judges </I><I>v. </I><I>Attorney-General of Saskatchewan<A href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[61]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>, </I>where the Privy Council reaffirmed, as applying to judges' salaries,
the view already expounded in <I>Attorney-General of Manitoba </I><I>v. </I><I>Forbes<A href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[62]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>,
</I>above mentioned.</P>

<P class="Para"><I>Prima facie, </I>in view of the above decision, it would, therefore, seem that the
assets of the banks cannot be protected by the courts against the alleged
destroying power of provincial taxation any more than salaries of Dominion
civil servants or the emoluments of His Majesty's judges.</P>

<P class="Para">Where the United States Supreme Court can
exercise certain powers, the decisions above quoted seem to preclude this Court
from doing the same, on account of the powers reserved to the central
government under our constitution. The Privy Council has set no definite limit
to the legislative competence of the provinces to levy direct taxation within
the province in order to the raising of revenue for provincial purposes. If
such power is used unwisely or extravagantly, against the best interest of the
whole of Canada, the power of disallowance by the Governor-General in Council,
or, as in this case, that of reservation by the Lieutenant-Governor, acting,
presumably, according to his instructions from the central government, are the
only means or safety valves provided in our &quot; carefully balanced
constitution,&quot; to see that &quot; no one of the parts can pass laws for
itself except under the control of the whole acting through the
Governor-General.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">It must be borne in mind, however, that in the
two cases last cited the Attorney-General of Canada did not appear before the
Court, did not interfere in any way to show that, in the opinion of the Federal
Government, the interests of the Dominion as a body politic were at stake when
the emoluments fixed by Parliament for the Judiciary or the civil service were
reduced by provincial taxation. In the present reference, the Dominion takes a
very strong stand and contends that this bill, linked with the two others,
constitutes essential encroachment upon the exclusive powers of Parliament of
legislating in relation to &quot; banking, incorporation of banks and paper
money&quot; and is, therefore,</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 141]</P>

<P class="Para"><I>ultra vires. </I>Perhaps, under these altered circumstances, the Privy Council, if
this matter is brought before Their Lordships, will reopen the question and
reconsider the scope to be given to the decisions above quoted. They may even
distinguish this reserved bill from the Quebec Act considered in <I>Bank of Toronto v. Lambe<A href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[63]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.</I></P>

<P class="Para">As to the question whether the tax is taxation
within the province, &quot; any person found within the province may legally be
taxed there if taxed directly,&quot; according to <I>Bank of Toronto v. Lambe<SUP>63</SUP>, </I>and also according to the same authority, &quot; whether the method
of assessing this tax is I sound or unsound, wise or unwise, is a point on
which we have no opinion, and are not called on to form one, for, if it does
not carry the taxation out of the Province, it is for the legislature and not
for the courts of law to judge of its expediency.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">For my part, although I always believed that the
efficiency of essentially federal services, like banking, cannot be impaired by
provincial legislation, I, at first, felt myself bound by these concurrent and
recent decisions to say that the Alberta Legislature is competent to enact a
statute in the terms of this bill. But, after perusing with great advantage the
reasons of my Lord the Chief Justice, I reach the conclusion that the bill,
despite its form, does not seek to raise revenue for provincial purposes but,
in its true character, aims, by erecting a prohibitive barrier, to prevent the
banks from conducting their legitimate business in Alberta. Such purpose and
effect must be declared <I>ultra
vires </I>of the legislature of Alberta, which cannot
use its special powers as an indirect means of destroying powers given by the
Parliament of Canada.</P>

<P class="Para">The answer to the first question must be in the
negative.</P>

<P class="Para">II.</P>

<P class="Para">The second question in the order of reference is
the following:</P>

<P class="Citation1">Is Bill No. 8, entitled <I>An Act to Amend
and Consolidate the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, or </I>any of the
provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent <I>intra
vires of </I>the legislature of the province of Alberta?</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 142]</P>

<P class="Para">After a full study of the matter and as I was
ready to write my opinion in answer to this question, I had the advantage of
reading the careful analysis of the bill prepared by my brother Kerwin and his
criticism of its differ&shy;ent clauses. I find that I could add nothing useful to
his reasons. I agree with him and his conclusions; and I would, therefore,
answer Question 2 in the negative. This Bill, if it became law, would
constitute an invasion by the province of Alberta of the Dominion's exclusive
power, of regulating banks and banking.</P>

<P class="Para">III.</P>

<P class="Para">The third question put to us is the following:</P>

<P class="Citation1">Is Bill No. 9, entitled <I>An Act to ensure
the Publication of Accur&shy;ate News and Information, </I>or any of the provisions
thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent <I>intra vires
of </I>the legislature of the province <I>of </I>Alberta?</P>

<P class="Para">The order-in-council represents that it has been
and is the avowed object of the present government of the province of Alberta
to inaugurate in the said province a &quot; new economic order &quot; upon the
principles or plan of the theory known as the &quot;Social Credit&quot;; and
that the said government has since secured the enactment of several statutes
more or less related to the policy of effectuating the said object. The
preamble of the bill, which I will hereafter call the &quot;Press bill&quot;
recites that it is</P>

<P class="Citation1">expedient and in the public interest that
the newspapers published in the Province should furnish to the people of the
Province statements made by the authority of the Government of the Province as
to the true and exact objects of the policy of the Government and as to the
hindrances to or difficulties in. achieving such objects to the end that the
people may be informed with respect thereto.</P>

<P class="Para">Section 3 provides that any proprietor, editor,
publisher or manager of any newspaper published in the province shall, when
required to do so by the Chairman of the Board constituted by section 3 of the <I>Alberta
Social Credit </I><I>Act, </I>publish in that newspaper any statement furnished by the Chairman
which has for its object the correction or amplification of any statement
relating to any policy or activity of the government of the province published
by that newspaper within the next preceding thirty-one days.</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 143]</P>

<P class="Para">And section 4 provides that the proprietor,
etc., of any newspaper upon being required by the Chairman in writing shall
within twenty-four hours after the delivery of the requirement</P>

<P class="Citation1">make a return in waiting setting out every
source from which any information emanated, as to any statement contained in
any issue of the newspaper published within sixty days of the making of the
requirement and the names, addresses and occupations of all persons by whom
such information was furnished to the newspaper and the name and address of the
writer of any editorial, article or news item contained in any such issue of
the newspaper.</P>

<P class="Para">Section 5 denies any action for libel on account
of the publication of any statement pursuant to the Act.</P>

<P class="Para">Section 6 enacts that in the event of a
proprietor, etc., of any newspaper being guilty of any contravention of any of
the provisions of the Act, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, upon a
recommendation of the Chairman, may by order prohibit,</P>

<P class="Citation1">(a) the publication of such newspaper
either for a definite time or until further order;</P>

<P class="Citation1">(b) the publication in any newspaper of
anything written by any person specified in the order;</P>

<P class="Citation1">(c) the publication of any information
emanating from any person or source specified in the order.</P>

<P class="Para">Section 7 provides for penalties for
contraventions or defaults in complying with any requirement of the Act.</P>

<P class="Para">The policy referred to in the preamble of the
Press bill regarding which the people of the province are to be informed from
the government standpoint, is undoubtedly the Social Credit policy of the
government. The adminis&shy;tration of the bill is in the hands of the Chairman of
the Social Credit Board who is given complete and discretionary power by the
bill. &quot; Social Credit,&quot; according to sec. 2 <I>(b) </I>of ,ch. 3,
1937, second session, of <I>The
Alberta Social Credit Amendment Act is</I></P>

<P class="Citation1">the power resulting from the belief
inherent within society that its individual members in. association can gain
the objectives they desire;</P>

<P class="Para">and the objectives in which the people of
Alberta must have a firm and unshaken belief are the monetization of credit and
the creation of a provincial medium of exchange instead of money to be used for
the purposes of distributing to Albertans loans without interest, per capita
dividends and discount rates to purchase goods from retailers. This free
distribution would be based on the unused capacity of the industries and people
of the province of Alberta</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 144]</P>

<P class="Para">to produce goods and services, which capacity
remains unused on account of the lack or absence of purchasing power in the
consumers in the province. The purchasing power would equal or absorb this
hitherto unused capacity to produce goods and services by the issue of Treasury
Credit certificates against a Credit Fund or Provincial credit account
established by the Commission each year representing the monetary value of this
&quot;unused capacity&quot; &mdash;which is also called &quot; Alberta credit.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">It seems obvious that this kind of credit cannot
succeed unless every one should be induced to believe in it and help it along.
The word &quot; credit &quot; comes from the latin: <I>credere, </I>to believe.
It is, therefore, essential to control the sources of information of the people
of Alberta, in order to keep them immune from any vacillation in their absolute
faith in the plan of the government. The Social Credit doctrine must become,
for the people of Alberta, a sort of religious dogma of which a free and
uncontrolled discussion is not permissible. The bill aims to control any
statement relating to any policy or activity of the government of the province
and declares this object to be a matter of public interest. The bill does not
regulate the relations of the newspapers' owners with private individual
members of the public, but deals exclusively with expressions of opinion by the
newspapers concerning government policies and activities. The pith and
substance of the bill is to regulate the press of Alberta from the viewpoint of
public policy by preventing the public from being misled or deceived as to any
policy or activity of the Social Credit Government and by reducing any
opposition to silence or bring upon it ridicule and public contempt.</P>

<P class="Para">I agree with the submission of the
Attorney-General for Canada that this bill deals with the regulation of the
press of Alberta, not from the viewpoint of private wrongs or civil injuries
resulting from any alleged infringement or privation of civil rights which
belong to individuals, con&shy;sidered as individuals, but from the viewpoint of
public wrongs or crimes, i.e., involving a violation of the public rights and
duties to the whole community, considered as a community, in its social
aggregate capacity.</P>

<P class="Para">Do the provisions of this bill, as alleged by
the Attorney-General for Canada, invade the domain of criminal</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 145]</P>

<P class="Para">law and trench upon the exclusive legislative
jurisdiction of the Dominion in this regard?</P>

<P class="Para">The object of an amendment of the criminal law,
as a rule, is to deprive the citizen of the right to do that, apart from the
amendment, he could lawfully do. Sections 130 to 136 of the Criminal Code deal
with seditious words and seditious publications; and sect. 133 (a) reads as
follows:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">No one shall be deemed to have a seditious
intention only because he intends in good faith,&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation2">(a) to show that His Majesty has been
misled or mistaken in his measures; or</P>

<P class="Citation2">(b) to point out errors, or defects in the <I>government
</I>or constitu&shy;tion of the United Kingdom, or of any part of it, or of Canada
or <I>any province thereof, </I>or in either House of Parliament of the United
Kingdom or of Canada, or <I>in any legislature, </I>or in the administration of
justice; or to excite His Majesty's subjects to attempt to procure, by lawful
means, the alteration of any matter of state; or</P>

<P class="Citation2">(c) to point out, in order to their
removal, matters which are pro&shy;ducing or have a tendency to produce feelings of
hatred and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjects.</P>

<P class="Para">It appears that in England, at first, criticism
of any gov&shy;ernment policy was regarded as a crime involving severe penalties
and punishable as such; but since the passing of Fox's Libel Act in 1792, the
considerations now found in the above article of our criminal code that it is
not criminal to point out errors in the Government of the country and to urge
their removal by lawful means have been admitted as a valid defence in a trial
for libel.</P>

<P class="Para">Now, it seems to me that the Alberta legislature
by this retrograde Bill is attempting to revive the old theory of the crime of
seditious libel by enacting penalties, confiscation of space in newspapers and
prohibitions for actions which, after due consideration by the Dominion
Parliament, have been declared innocuous and which, therefore, every citizen of
Canada can do lawfully and without hindrance or fear of punishment. It is an
attempt by the legislature to amend the Criminal Code in this respect and to
deny the advantage of sect. 133 (a) to the Alberta newspaper pub&shy;lishers.</P>

<P class="Para">Under the British system, which is ours, no
political party can erect a prohibitory barrier to prevent the electors from
getting information concerning the policy of the gov&shy;ernment. Freedom of
discussion is essential to enlighten public opinion in a democratic State; it
cannot be curtailed without affecting the right of the people to be informed</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 146]</P>

<P class="Para">through sources independent of the government
concerning matters of public interest. There must be an untrammelled
publication of the news and political opinions of the political parties
contending for ascendancy. As stated in the preamble of <I>The British North America Act, </I>our con&shy;stitution is and will remain, unless radically changed,
&quot; similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.&quot; At the time of
Confederation, the United Kingdom was a democracy. Democracy cannot be
maintained without its foundation: free public opinion and free discussion
throughout the nation of all matters affecting the State within the limits set
by the criminal code and the common law. Every inhabitant in Alberta is also a
citizen of the Dominion. The province may deal with his property and civil
rights of a local and private nature within the prov&shy;ince; but the province
cannot interfere with his status as a Canadian citizen and his fundamental
right to express freely his untrammelled opinion about government policies and
discuss matters of public concern. The mandatory and prohibitory provisions of
the Press Bill are, in my opinion, <I>ultra vires </I>of the provincial legislature.
They interfere with the free working of the political organization of the
Dominion. They have a tendency to nullify the political rights of the inhabitants
of Alberta, as citizens of Canada, and cannot be considered as dealing with
matters purely private and local in that province. The federal parliament is
the sole authority to curtail, if deemed ex&shy;pedient and in the public interest,
the freedom of the press in discussing public affairs and the equal rights in
that respect of all citizens throughout the Dominion. These subjects were
matters of criminal law before Confedera&shy;tion, have been recognized by
Parliament as criminal matters and have been expressly dealt with by the crim&shy;inal
code. No province has the power to reduce in that province the political rights
of its citizens as compared with those enjoyed by the citizens of other
provinces of Canada. Moreover, citizens outside the province of Alberta have a
vital interest in having full information and comment, favourable and
unfavourable, regarding the policy of the Alberta government and concerning
events in that province which would, in the ordinary course, be the subject of
Alberta newspapers' news items and articles.</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 147]</P>

<P class="Para">I would, therefore, answer the question as to
Bill No. 9 in the negative.</P>

<P class="Para">The judgment of Crocket and Kerwin JJ., <I>re </I>Bank taxa&shy;tion
Act, was delivered by</P>

<P class="Para">KERWIN J.&mdash;In an opinion released simultaneously
with this, I have expressed my views with reference to Bill no. 8 of the
Legislative Assembly of Alberta being <I>An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Credit of Alberta
Regula&shy;tion Act. </I>The first question of the three
referred to in that opinion relates to what is known as Bill no. <I>1, An Act respecting the Taxation of Banks,
</I>and it is to that Bill that I now direct my
attention.</P>

<P class="Para">By section 2 (a) thereof:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">(a) &quot;Bank&quot; means a corporation
.or joint stock company other than the Bank of Canada wherever incorporated and
which is incorporated for the purpose of doing banking business or the business
of a savings bank and which transacts such business in the province whether the
head office is situate in. the province and elsewhere.</P>

<P class="Para">By section 3, every bank which transacts
business in the province is required to pay annually to the Minister (the
Provincial Secretary) on behalf of His Majesty for the use of the province, in
addition to any tax payable pursuant to any other Act, a tax of one-half of one
per centum on the paid-up capital thereof, and a tax of one per centum on the
reserve fund and undivided profits thereof. The Bill provides for returns to be
made by every bank according to forms to be prescribed by the Minister, and
contains additional sections to ensure the filing of such returns and the
payment of the taxes.</P>

<P class="Para">Our attention has been called to the increase in
the taxation of banks that would be effected by the provisions of this Bill. As
provincial legislation stood prior to the First Session of the Alberta
Legislature in 1937, the tax on all banks doing business in the province
amounted to $72,200 per annum. By chapter 57 of that session a tax was imposed
which would increase the sum realized by $140,000 per annum. The additional tax
proposed by Bill 1 amounts to $2,081,925 in each year.</P>

<P class="Para">It is argued that the magnitude of the tax
proposed for this one province is such that if it were applied by each of the
other provinces, it would have the effect of preventing </P>

<P class="Page">[Page 148]</P>

<P class="Para">banks from exercising their functions. That, of
course, is not the situation confronting us. This Bill has been passed by the
Legislative Assembly of one province only and, considering the enactment by
itself, the amount of the impost is to be determined by the competent tax&shy;ing
authority. It is not for a court to say that a certain tax is exorbitant
because, in addition to any expression of opinion being the particular or, it
may be, the peculiar view of an individual judge, or even of a number of
judges, that is not the function of the judiciary.</P>

<P class="Para">However, omitting any reference to other
arguments which have been adduced against the power of the Alberta Legislature
to enact into law such a Bill, I believe that the time has now arrived when the
question left open by this Court in <I>Abbott v. City of Saint John<SUP>54</SUP>, </I>must be considered. In that case, which concerned the validity of a
tax by provincial legislation on a Dominion official, Davies J., dealing with
the contention that provincial taxa&shy;tion might paralyze the Dominion Civil
Service, stated:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">If, under the guise of exercising power, of
taxation, confiscation of a substantial part of official and other salaries
were attempted, it would be then time enough to consider the question and not
to assume before-hand such a suggested misuse of the power.</P>

<P class="Para">The decision in the <I>Abbott </I>case<A href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[64]</SPAN></SPAN></A> was approved by the Judicial Committee in <I>Caron v. The King<A href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[65]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A> </I>and in <I>Forbes v.
Attorney-General for Manitoba<A href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[66]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.
</I>As pointed out at page <I>270 </I>in the latter, an
argument in terrorem similar to that raised in the <I>Abbott </I>case<SUP>54</SUP>
had been advanced and rejected in <I>Bank of Toronto v. Lambe<A href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[67]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.
</I>While Davies J. left the question open, Lord Hobhouse,
speaking for the Board in the <I>Lambe </I>case<SUP>57</SUP>, contented himself
with stating that</P>

<P class="Citation1">their Lordships cannot conceive that when
the Imperial Parliament conferred wide powers of local self-government on great
countries such as Quebec, it intended to limit them on the speculation that
they would be used in an injurious manner.</P>

<P class="Para">In none of the three cases decided by the
Judicial Com&shy;mittee, nor in the <I>Abbott </I>case<SUP>54</SUP> was it suggested
that the Acts in question were not true taxing enactments but it is contended
at Bar that the same cannot be said of the Bill under review and it therefore
becomes necessary to investigate that submission.</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 149]</P>

<P class="Para">In that connection we have been referred to
certain other enactments passed by the Alberta Assembly. The first of these is <I>The Alberta Social Credit Act, </I>chapter 10 of the First 1937 Session, an Act which is still in
force. It is unnecessary to detail the provisions of that Act as that has been
done in the opinion delivered by My Lord the Chief Justice on the validity of
Bills 1, 8 and 9. An examination of these provisions leaves no doubt in my mind
that the Act is an attempt to regulate and control banks and banking as those
terms are used in head 15 of section 91 of <I>The British North America Act.</I></P>

<P class="Para">In the Second 1937 Session was passed <I>The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act. </I>The recitals in that Act are as follows:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">Whereas Bank Deposits and Bank Loans in
Alberta .are made possible mainly or wholly as a result of the monetization of
the credit of the People of Alberta, which credit is the basis of the credit of
the province of Alberta; and</P>

<P class="Citation1">Whereas the extent to which property and
civil Tights in the province may be enjoyed depends upon the principles
governing the monetization of credit and the means whereby such credit is made
available to the province and to the People collectively and individually of
the province; and</P>

<P class="Citation1">Whereas it is expedient that the business
of banking in Alberta shall be controlled with the object of attaining for the
People of Alberta the full enjoyment of property and civil rights in the
province:</P>

<P class="Para">The Act then requires, by appropriate
provisions, every banker carrying on the business of banking within the province
at the time of the coming into force of the Act to take out a licence, and also
every employee of a bank. Except that this Act refers to banks and the business
of banking, by name, and includes employees of banks, the sections are
practically the same as those of Bill 8. The first and third recitals are
omitted but the second is identical in each enactment. For the reasons given by
me when considering Bill 8, all of which apply with even greater force to this
Act, I consider the legislation would be ultra vires of the province.</P>

<P class="Para">Chapter <I>2, An Act to provide for the Restriction of the Civil
Rights of Certain Persons, </I>also passed in the
Second 1937 Session, recites:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">Whereas Bank Deposits and Bank Loans in
Alberta are made possible mainly or wholly as a result of the monetization of
the credit of the People of Alberta, which credit is the basis of the credit of
the province of Alberta; and</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 150]</P>

<P class="Citation1">Whereas the extent to which property and
civil rights in the province may be enjoyed depends upon the principles
governing the monetization of credit and the means whereby such credit is made
available to the province and to the People, collectively and individually, of
the province; and</P>

<P class="Citation1">Whereas it is expedient that the business
of Banking in the province shall be controlled with the object of attaining for
the People of Alberta the full enjoyment of property and civil rights in the
province;</P>

<P class="Para">Section 3 provides:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">Any person who is an employee of a banker
and who is required to be licensed pursuant to any provision of &quot;The
Credit of Alberta Regulation Act&quot; shall not while unlicensed for any
reason whatsoever, be capable of bringing, maintaining or defending any action
in any Court of Civil Jurisdiction in .the province which has for its, object
the enforcement of any claim either in. law or equity,</P>

<P class="Para">This Act would fall with the one requiring a
licence to be obtained.</P>

<P class="Para">On August 17, 1937, the Governor General in
Council ordered that these two Acts together with one amending the <I>Judicature Act </I>be
disallowed, and such disallowance was duly signified by proclamation of the
Lieutenant Gov&shy;ernor of Alberta dated August 27, 1937, and published in the <I>Canada Gazette </I>on
September 11, 1937. The Third 1937 Session was opened on September 24, 1937,
and it was at this session that Bills nos. 1 and 8 were passed and on October
5, 1937, reserved by the Lieutenant Governor for the signification of the
pleasure of the Governor General.</P>

<P class="Para">It would appear to be relevant at this stage to
refer to <I>The Reciprocal
Insurers </I>case<A href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[68]</SPAN></SPAN></A>

Act of Canada<A href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[69]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.
</I>The extract from the judg&shy;ment in the former case,
which was quoted with approval in the latter and there paraphrased, might, I
think not inappropriately, be quoted and re-paraphrased for the purposes of the
present inquiry. But what is even more important in my &mdash;view is the statement
in the former case, at page 332 of the report, that two Dominion statutes
passed on the same day, one intituled <I>The Insurance Act, 1917, </I>and
the other <I>An Act to Amend
the Criminal Code </I>were complementary parts of a
single legislative plan and were &quot; admittedly an attempt to produce by a
different legislative procedure the results aimed at by the authors of the <I>Insurance Act </I>of
1910 which in <I>Attorney-General
for Canada v. Attorney-General for Alberta<A href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[70]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>
</I>was pronounced </P>

<P class="Page">[Page 151]</P>

<P class="Para"><I>ultra vires </I>of the Dominion Parliament.&quot; In the present reference it is not
admitted, by counsel for the Attorney-General of Alberta that Bill I is part of
a single legislative plan but I can draw no other conclusion. It is true that
none of the other legislation referred to has been previously declared beyond
the competence of the provin&shy;cial legislature, but I have already indicated
that, in my opinion, <I>The
Alberta Social Credit Act, The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, </I>and <I>An Act to
provide for the Restriction of the Civil Rights of Certain Persons </I>are of that character.</P>

<P class="Para">The sequence of events after the disallowance of
the three Acts is so significant that I can find no escape from the conclusion
that, instead of being a taxing enactment, Bill I is merely a part of a
legislative plan to prevent the operation within the province of those banking
institutions which have been called into existence and given the neces&shy;sary
powers to conduct their business by the only proper authority, the Parliament
of Canada.</P>

<P class="Para">If this view be correct, then it follows that
the Bill is not one covered by the decision of this Court in the <I>Abbott </I>case<A href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

in the three cases mentioned, but is governed by the <I>Reciprocal Insurers </I>case<A href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[72]</SPAN></SPAN></A> and <I>In Re The Insurance Act of Canada<A href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;

<P class="Para">For these reasons I would answer question 1 in
the negative.</P>

<P class="Para">The judgment of Crocket and Kerwin JJ., <I>re </I>Credit
Regulation, was delivered by</P>

<P class="Para">KERWIN J.&mdash;On October 5, 1937, three Bills were passed by the Legislative
Assembly of the province of Alberta but were reserved by the
Lieutenant-Governor for the signifi&shy;cation of the Governor General's pleasure.
Pending con&shy;sideration of the advice to be tendered to the Governor General as
to the propriety of signifying or withholding signification of the Royal Assent
to these Bills, the Gover&shy;nor General in Council referred to this Court three
ques&shy;tions as to whether these Bills, or any of the provisions thereof, and in
what particular or particulars, or to what</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 152]</P>

<P class="Para">extent, were <I>intra vires of </I>the
Legislature of the Province of Alberta. The Bills are numbered and intituled as
follows : &mdash;</P>

<P class="Indent1">Bill no. 1, &quot; An Act Respecting the
Taxation of Banks.&quot;</P>

<P class="Indent1">Bill no. 8, &quot;An Act to Amend and
Consolidate the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act.&quot;</P>

<P class="Indent1">Bill no. 9, &quot; An Act to Ensure the
Publication of Accurate News and Information.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">I propose to consider question no. 2, referring
to Bill no. 8.</P>

<P class="Para">Counsel for the Attorney-General of Canada
submit that it would be <I>ultra
vires </I>of the provincial legislature to enact this
legislation because the subject matter falls under one or more heads of section
91 of the <I>British North
America Act, 1867.</I></P>

<P class="Para">In the factum of the Attorney-General of Canada
appears a great mass of material, some of which was referred to on the
argument. The admissibility and rele&shy;vancy of a great part of it was objected
to, but the Court heard what counsel desired to say upon the subject without
determining the issues raised. None of it was relied upon by counsel for the
provincial Attorney-General. Some of this material is of such a character that
it is clearly relevant and admissible while other parts are just as clearly
irrele&shy;vant and inadmissible. However, it is unnecessary to determine the exact
line that separates the one class from the other since, after a detailed
examination of the provi&shy;sions of the Bill itself, I have arrived at the
conclusion that the Bill <I>in
toto is ultra vires </I>of the provincial legis&shy;lature.</P>

<P class="Para">The Bill contains the following recital:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">Whereas the extant to which property and
civil rights in the province may be enjoyed depends upon the principles
governing the monetization of credit and the means whereby such credit is made
available to the province and to the People collectively and individually of
the province.</P>

<P class="Para">Section 2 is the definition section and is as
follows:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">2. In this Act, unless the context
otherwise requires,&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation2">(a) &quot; Credit Institution &quot; means
a person or corporation whose business or any part of whose business is the
business of dealing in credit;</P>

<P class="Citation2">(b) &quot;Business of dealing in
credit&quot; means all business transactions in the Province of a credit institution
or any other person except The Bank of Canada, whereby credit is created,
issued, lent, provided or dealt in by means of bookkeeping entries,</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 153]</P>

<P class="Citation2">in any ease and at any time when the
aggregate amount of all credit so created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in
is in excess of the total amount of legal tender in the possession of the
credit institution so creating, issuing, lending, providing or dealing in such
credit: and includes the following transactions relating to any credit so
created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in, namely, the &quot;payment of
cheques or other negotiable instru&shy;ments made, drawn or paid in by customers,
the making of advances and the granting of overdrafts; but does not include
transactions which are banking within the meaning of the word 'banking' as used
in subhead 15 of section 91 of The British North America Act, 1867 &quot;;</P>

<P class="Citation2">(c) &quot;Local Directorate&quot; means a
local Directorate constituted pursuant to section 4 of this Act;</P>

<P class="Citation2">(d) &quot;Provincial Credit
Commission&quot; means the Commission constituted pursuant to section 4 of The
Alberta Social Credit Act; </P>

<P class="Citation2">(e) &quot;Social Credit Board&quot; means
the Board constituted pursuant to section 3 of The
Alberta Social Credit Act.</P>

<P class="Para">By subsection 1 of section 3 &quot; every credit
institution which at the time of the coming into force of this Act is carrying
on the business of dealing in credit within the province &quot; shall within
twenty-one days thereafter apply for and obtain a licence from the Commission
in respect of such business, and every application is to be accom&shy;panied by the
necessary fee. By subsection 3 of section 3 every such application is also to
be accompanied by an undertaking whereby the applicant undertakes to refrain
from acting or assisting or encouraging any person or persons to act in a
manner which restricts or interferes with the property and civil rights of any
person or persons within the province. By subsection 4 of section 3 the
Commission is given power at any time or from time to time and without notice,
to suspend, revoke or cancel the licence of any credit institution which
commits a breach of the undertaking.</P>

<P class="Para">Under section 5, any credit institution which
carries on the business of dealing in credit in the province without having
first obtained a licence, or who violates any other provisions of the Act or
the regulations made thereunder, is to incur a penalty of ten thousand dollars
for each day during which it carries on business without a licence, &quot;and
every such penalty may be recovered by action brought on behalf of the Crown by
the Provincial Treasurer in any court of competent jurisdiction as a debt due
to the Crown.&quot; I refer to section 5 at this stage because by subsection 5
of section 3 any credit institution whose licence has been suspended, </P>

<P class="Page">[Page 154]</P>

<P class="Para">revoked or cancelled by the Commission is given
a right to appeal to the Board but, as I read the concluding part of this
subsection, no such right of appeal extends to any credit institution against
which a judgment has been entered pursuant to section 5, on the ground or for
the reason that the institution had acted, or assisted, or encour&shy;aged any
person to act in a manner which restricts or interferes with the property or
civil rights of any person within the province. That is, under section 5, the
penalty referred to may be incurred by reason of several things but, if it
happens that judgment is given for such penalty by reason of the specific
matters referred to in the latter part of subsection 5 of section 3, the right
which an institution would otherwise have to appeal to the Board from the
suspension, revocation or cancellation of its licence by the Commission no
longer exists.</P>

<P class="Para">Reverting to section 3, provision is made by
subsections 6 and 7 thereof for an annual licence fee in such amount as may be
fixed by the Commissioner, not exceeding an amount equivalent to one hundred
dollars in respect of every building within the province in which the business
of such credit institution is conducted; but, if the licence has been
suspended, revoked or cancelled, the Commission may, for renewing the licence
or issuing a new one, fix a fee in excess of that mentioned, provided that such
increased fee is not to exceed one thousand times the fee paid or required to
be paid in respect of the licence last issued to such institution.</P>

<P class="Para">By section 4 &quot;for the purpose of preventing
any act by such credit institution constituting a restriction or inter&shy;ference,
either direct or indirect, with the full enjoyment of property and civil rights
by any person within the Province&quot;, one or more Local Directorates (the
number of which is to be in the absolute discretion of the Board) shall be
appointed to supervise, direct and control the policy of the business of
dealing in credit of such institution in respect of which such Local
Directorate has been appointed. Each Local Directorate is to consist of five
persons, three of whom are to be appointed by the Board and two by the credit
institution, and provision is made for the dismissal of any of the Board's
appointees.</P>

<P class="Para">It will be observed that under clause A of the
definition section the entire business of a &quot;credit institution&quot; need
not</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 155]</P>

<P class="Para">be that of dealing in credit but it is
sufficient if part only falls within that category. By clause (b) of section 2,
an institution is dealing in credit, either wholly or in part, only when <I>&quot;the aggregate amount of all credit *
* * </I><I>is </I><I>in excess of the total amount of legal tender in the
pos&shy;session of the credit institution.&quot; </I>This
is important because it is only in such an event that the &quot; business of
dealing in credit &quot; means business transactions in the province
&quot;whereby credit is created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in by means of
bookkeeping entries,&quot; and the business transactions which the Bill
purports to cover are only those whereby credit is created, etc., by means of
bookkeeping entries.</P>

<P class="Para">In my opinion these transactions fall within the
meaning of the term &quot; banking &quot; as used in head 15 of section 91 of <I>The British North America Act. </I>As pointed out by Lord Watson, speaking for the Judicial Committee,
in <I>Tennant </I><I>v. </I><I>Union
Bank of Canada<A href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[74]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>,
</I>the words used in head 15 of section 91, &quot;
Banking, Incorporation of Banks, and the Issue of Paper Money,&quot; are
&quot;wide enough to embrace every transaction coming within the legitimate
business of a banker.&quot; The nature of such business &quot;is a part of the
law merchant and is to be judicially noticed by the Court,&quot; per Lord
Campbell, during the course of the argument in <I>The Bank of Australasia v. Breillat<A href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[75]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>, </I>re&shy;ferring to <I>Brandao
v. Barnett<A href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[76]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.</I></P>

<P class="Para">Accordingly, upon referring to the New English
(Oxford) Dictionary we find that the word &quot; credit,&quot; which is used in
the Bill, is defined as &quot; a sum placed at a person's dis&shy;posal in the
books of a bank, etc., upon which he may draw to the extent of the amount; any
note, bill or other docu&shy;ment, on security of which a person may obtain
funds&quot;; and at page 48 of the third volume of the 14th edition of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica, under the title &quot; Banking and Credit&quot; appears
the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">Banks create credit. It is a mistake to
suppose that bank credit is created to any important extent by the payment of
money into the banks. Money is always being paid in by tradesmen and others who
receive it in the course of business, and drawn out again by employers to pay
wages and by depositors in general for use as pocket money. But the change of
money into credit money and of credit money back</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 156]</P>

<P class="Citation1">into money does not alter the total amount
of the means of payment in the hands of the community. When a bank lends, by
granting an advance or discounting a bill, the effect is different. Two debts
are created; the trader who borrows becomes indebted to the bank at a future
date, and the bank becomes immediately indebted to the trader. The bank's debt
is a means of payment; it is credit money. It is a clear addition to the amount
of the means of payment in the community. The bank does not lend money. The
borrower can, if he pleases, take out the whole amount of the loan in money. He
is in that respect in the same position, any other depositor. But like other
depositors he is likely in practice to use credit for all major payments and
only to draw out money as and when needed for minor payments.</P>

<P class="Para">It is not necessary to refer to the various
schools of economists with their divergent views as to the extent to which
banks create credit or as to the wisdom or otherwise of a state empowering such
institutions to do so. It suffices that by current common understanding a
business transaction whereby credit is created, issued, lent, pro&shy;vided or
dealt in by means of bookkeeping entries is con&shy;sidered to be part of the
business of banking as it has been practised and developed. It is well known
that in addition to creating credit banks also issue, lend, provide and deal in
credit by means of bookkeeping entries.</P>

<P class="Para">That banks are contemplated by Bill 8 as being
the credit institutions to be licensed seems evident from the direction in
section 3, subsection 1, that an application for a licence is to be made by
&quot;every credit institution which at the time of the coming into force of
this Act is carrying on the business of dealing in credit within the
province&quot;; thus envisaging only institutions of that character which are
already carrying on business; and banks are the only ones answering that
description under the restrictions embodied in that part of clause (b) of
section 2 quoted in an earlier part of these reasons and italicized. A
construction might be placed upon other provisions of the Bill that would
embrace such other institutions that desired to commence the defined business,
but such a construction would be strained and the other is more consonant with
the evident intention of the Bill as disclosed by its terms.</P>

<P class="Para">In addition to the terms already commented on,
banks are plainly indicated by the following extract from clause (b) of section
2, which follows the statement of what &quot; business of dealing in credit
&quot; means:&mdash;&quot; and includes the following transactions relating to any
credit so created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in, namely, the payment of</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 157]</P>

<P class="Para">cheques or other negotiable instruments, made,
drawn or paid in by customers, the making of advances and the granting of
overdrafts.&quot; The transactions specifically mentioned form part of an
ordinary banking business; and the exception of the Bank of Canada from &quot;a
credit institu&shy;tion or any other person,&quot; in clause (b) of section 2,
strengthens the conclusion that banks are the institutions covered by the
provisions of the Bill.</P>

<P class="Para">The reference in the Bill to &quot; property and
civil rights within the province &quot; does not touch the point as almost any
Act of Parliament relating to the matters assigned to its jurisdiction would
affect property and civil rights, and it would still be valid. According to
several decisions of the Judicial Committee, even if in some aspects the
matters dealt with by this Bill could be said to fall within head 13 of section
92 (as to which I express no opinion), the final words of section 91 exclude
provincial authority as the pith and substance of the Bill bring it within one
of the enumerated subjects assigned to Parliament &quot;notwith&shy;standing
anything in this Act.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">The control to be exercised over credit
institutions is far reaching. In addition to the undertaking required by every
applicant for a licence and the provisions providing for a fee and an increased
fee, and in addition to the powers conferred to suspend, revoke or cancel a
licence, Local Directorates are to be appointed, a majority of whose mem&shy;bers
shall be nominees of the Board. Then, by section 8, the Commission, with the
approval of the Lieutenant-Gov&shy;ernor in Council, may make regulations: &mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">(e) prescribing the privileges, terms,
conditions, limitations and restrictions to be granted to or observed by any
licensee;</P>

<P class="Citation1">(f) prescribing the conditions upon which
licences may be issued and providing for the revocation, suspension or
withholding of licences;</P>

<P class="Para">The regulations, however, are not restricted to
the matters dealt with by the Bill. While undoubtedly they could not go beyond
the powers possessed by the Legislature itself, it is sufficient, according to
the opening phrase of section 8, that the regulations be &quot; not inconsis&shy;tent
with this Act.&quot; All these provisions are significant as indicating that
the Bill is not a taxing enactment but an attempt to regulate and control every
bank and the business of banking.</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 158]</P>

<P class="Para">There remains for consideration the effect of
the concluding phrase in clause (b) of section 2,&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">but does not include transactions which are
banking within the meaning of the word. &quot;banking&quot; as used in. subhead
15 of section 91 of <I>The British North America Act,
1867.</I></P>

<P class="Para">and of section 7:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">No provisions of this Act shall be so
construed as to authorize the doing of any act or thing which is not within the
legislative com&shy;petence of the legislature of the province.</P>

<P class="Para">As to the former, it is contended by counsel for
Alberta that, if, omitting the concluding phrase, only banks would be covered,
the entire clause is not unintelligible but there might remain in fact no
institutions to which the clause could apply; that it would, therefore, be
nugatory and it could not be declared to be beyond the competence of the
provincial legislature to enact the Bill as a law. But it is a sound principle
in the construction of enactments that the Court will not presume an intention
to enact a meaningless statute or section and here the correct inter&shy;pretation
appears to be that banks were intended to be and are covered by the definition,
and that the last part of section 2, clause (b) was added in an effort to save
legislation which on the proper construction of the other provisions of the
Bill is unconstitutional. The same remarks apply to section 7.</P>

<P class="Para">In <I>The King v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd.<A href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[77]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>,
</I>Lord Sumner, speaking for the Judicial Committee
and discussing the effect of the repeal of a provision in the Alberta <I>Liquor Act of </I>1916,
which proposed to exclude from the opera&shy;tion of the Act &quot;bona fide
transactions in liquor between a person in the province <I>of </I>Alberta and
a person in another province or in a foreign country,&quot; said at page 136:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">In their Lordships' opinion the real
question is whether the legisla&shy;ture has actually interfered with
inter-provincial or with foreign trade. The presence or absence of an express
disclaimer of any such interference may greatly assist where the language of
the provincial legislature does not in itself determine the question and define
its effect. If, however, it is otherwise clear that there is such an
interference, or that there is none, and the language actually used
sufficiently decides that question, there is no such sovereign efficacy in such
a clause as s. 72 as to make its presence or absence in an enactment crucial.</P>

<P class="Para">This statement would appear at first sight to be
in conflict with the statement by Lord MacNaghten in <I>Attorney General of Manitoba v. Manitoba
Licence</I></P>

<P class="Page">[Page 159]</P>

<P class="Para"><I>Holders' Association<A href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[78]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>, </I>where, in dealing with the ques&shy;tion as to the constitutionality of
the Manitoba <I>Liquor Act </I>of 1900, His Lordship observes:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">The <I>Liquor Act </I>proceeds upon a
recital that &quot;it is expedient to suppress the liquor traffic in Manitoba
by prohibiting provincial transac&shy;tions in liquor.&quot; That is the declared
object of the legislature set out at the commencement of the Act. Towards the
end of the Act there occurs this section:</P>

<P class="Citation1">&quot;119. While this Act is intended to
prohibit and shall prohibit transactions in liquor which take place wholly
within the province of Manitoba, except under a licence or as otherwise specially
provided by this Act, and restrict the consumption of liquor within the limits
of the province of Manitoba, it shall not affect and is not intended to affect
bona fide transactions in liquor between a person in the province of Manitoba
and a person in another province or in a foreign country, and the provisions of
this Act shall be construed accordingly.&quot; Now that provision is as much
part of the Act as any other section contained in it. It must have its full
effect in exempting from the operation of the Act all bona fide transactions in
liquor which come within its terms,</P>

<P class="Para">The principle to which Lord Sumner referred was
expressed somewhat differently by Viscount Haldane in <I>Attorney General for Manitoba v. Attorney
General for Canada<A href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[79]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>.
</I>That case had to do with the constitutional&shy;ity of
an Act of the Manitoba Legislature providing for the collection of a tax from
persons selling grain for future delivery. At page 566 of the report Viscount Haldane
refers to the principle by which the courts determine whether a tax is direct
or indirect, and explains:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">It does not exclude the operation of the
principle if, as here, by s. 5, the taxing Act merely expressly declares that
the tax is to be a direct one on the person entering into the contract of sale,
whether as principal or as broker or agent. For the question of the nature of
the tax is one of substance, and does not turn only on the language used by the
local Legislature which imposes it, but on the provisions of the Imperial
statute of 1867.</P>

<P class="Para">In <I>Attorney General for British Columbia v. Attorney General for Canada<A href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><B><SPAN style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial">[80]</SPAN></B></SPAN></A>, </I>the Judicial Committee determined that the Dominion <I>Natural Products Marketing Act, </I>1934, was <I>ultra
vires </I>of the Parliament of Canada. At page 387,
Lord Atkin, speaking for the Board, deals with the argument advanced that
certain portions of the Act at least should be declared valid. It was urged
that section 9 of the Act there under consideration was a valid exercise of the
powers of the Dominion Parliament because it purported to deal only with inter-provincial
or export trade; and Part 2 of the Act because it went no</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 160]</P>

<P class="Para">further than similar provisions in the <I>Combines Investiga&shy;tion Act </I>and was a genuine exercise of the Dominion legis&shy;lative authority
over criminal law; and stress was laid upon section 26 of the Act:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">If it be found that Parliament has exceeded
<I>its </I>powers in the
enactment of one or more of the provisions of this Act, none of the other or
remaining provisions of the Act shall therefore be held to be inoperative or
ultra vires, but the latter provisions shall stand as if they had been
originally enacted as separate and independent enactments and as the only
provisions of the Act; the intention of Parliament being to give independent
effect to the extent of its powers to every enactment and provision in this Act
contained.</P>

<P class="Para">At the foot of page 388 of the report his
Lordship deals with this argument stating:&mdash;</P>

<P class="Citation1">There appear to be two answers. In the
first place, it appears to their Lordships that the whole texture of the Act is
inextricably interwoven, and that neither s. 9 nor Part II can be contemplated
as existing independently of the provisions as to the creation of a Board and
the regulation of products. There are no separate and independent enactments to
which s. 26 could give a real existence. In the second place, both the Dominion
and British Columbia in their Cases filed on this appeal assert that the
sections now said to be severable are incidental and ancillary to the main
legislation. Their Lordships are of opinion that this is true : and that as the
main legislation is invalid as being in pith and substance an. 'encroachment
upon the Provincial rights the sections referred to must fall with it <I>as </I>being in part merely ancillary to it.</P>

<P class="Para">As applicable to the present case, the principle
might be stated thus:&mdash;Unless certain provisions of the Bill are severable, such
expressions as are found in the last part of clause (b) of section 2 and in
section 7 have no effect, if upon a consideration of the entire legislation the
conclusion is reached that the subject matter dealt with is beyond the powers
of the enacting authority. For the reasons given above, that is the conclusion
I have arrived at and I would therefore answer question 2 in the negative.</P>

<P class="Para">The judgment of Crocket and Kerwin JJ. <I>re </I>Press Act
was delivered by</P>

<P class="Para">KERWIN J.&mdash;The third question submitted to the
Court by the Governor General in Council asks our opinion as to whether Bill
No. 9 of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, <I>An </I><I>Act to Ensure the Publication of Accurate News and Information, </I>(hereafter referred to as the Press Bill) is <I>intra vires </I>of
the legislature of that province. It has already been noted that this Bill was
passed at the</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 161]</P>

<P class="Para">same time as Bills 1 and 8. After reciting that
&quot;it is expedient and in 'the public interest that the newspapers published
in the Province should furnish to the people of the Province statements made by
the authority of the Government of the Province as to the true and exact
objects of the policy of the Government and as to the hindrances to or
difficulties in achieving such objects, to the end that the people may be
informed with respect thereto,&quot; section 2(a) defines the word
&quot;Chairman&quot; as used in the Bill as &quot;the Chairman of the Board
constituted by section 3 of The Alberta Social Credit Act.&quot; By section 3 of
the Press Bill &quot;every person who is the proprietor, editor, publisher or
manager of any newspaper published in the Province, shall, when required so to
do by the Chairman, publish in that newspaper any statement furnished by the
Chairman which has for its object the .correction or amplification of any
statement relating to any policy or activity .of the Government of the Province
published by that newspaper within the next preceding thirty-one days.&quot;
The addi&shy;tional provisions of section 3 do not require our attention nor do the
provisions of section 5, which prohibit any action for libel by reason of the
publication of such statement.</P>

<P class="Para">Section 4 enacts that, within twenty-four hours
after the delivery of a written requisition by the Chairman, every person who
is the proprietor, etc., of any such newspaper shall give every source from
which any information emanated, as to any statement contained in any issue of
the newspaper published within sixty days of the making of the requirement. Six
and seven are the penalizing sections, and whatever their effect (as to which
counsel disagree) must stand or fall with the substantive sections 3 and 4.</P>

<P class="Para">The obligations imposed by these sections become
oper&shy;ative only upon the requisition of the Chairman of a Board, which was to
be constituted under the terms of another Bill which I have already indicated
is, in my opinion, ultra vires. The peculiar situation therefore exists that,
in answering the question as to one piece of legislation, it became necessary
to consider the provisions of another, which was not specifically referred to
the Court, and the conclusion was reached that the latter was <I>ultra vires </I>of
the provincial legislature; and it is by a section of that</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 162]</P>

<P class="Para">Bill that the Board, by virtue of the actions of
whose Chairman sections 3 and 4 of the Press Bill can have any operation, was
established. However, the result appears to be that the Press Bill is part of
the same legislative plan that, in my opinion, is outside the powers conferred
upon the provinces, and that the part must suffer the fate of the whole.</P>

<P class="Para">Other objections against the validity of the
Press Bill were urged but I refrain from expressing any opinion upon them. They
raise important constitutional questions, the consideration, which I prefer to
postpone until the need to do so arises.</P>

<P class="Para">For the above reasons I would answer question 3
in the negative.</P>

<P class="Para">HUDSON, J.&mdash;I concur in the answers proposed by
the other members of the Court on the various questions sub&shy;mitted in this
reference.</P>

<P class="Para">It is clear that the three bills submitted are
part of one legislative scheme, the central measure of which is <I>The Alberta Social Credit Act. </I>That Act has been the subject of a searching analysis by my Lord the
Chief Justice and I concur in his reasons for holding that it is beyond the
powers of the legislature.</P>

<P class="Para">Section ninety-one of the British North America
Act allots exclusive legislative authority to the Dominion in all matters
coming within the following classes of subjects:</P>

<P class="Indent1">91 (2) The regulation of trade and commerce;</P>

<P class="Indent2">(14) Currency and coinage;</P>

<P class="Indent2">(15) Banking, incorporation of banks and the
issue of paper money;</P>

<P class="Indent2">(16) Savings banks;</P>

<P class="Indent2">(18) Bills of exchange and promissory notes;</P>

<P class="Indent2">(19) Interest;</P>

<P class="Indent2">(20) Legal tender.</P>

<P class="Para">Read together these have a cumulative effect, I
think, much greater than if individual headings were taken separately. This is
especially so when the object of the measure under consideration is the
establishment by a province of a new economic order such as <I>The Social Credit Act. </I>So read they strongly reinforce the reasons already given against
the validity of this Act.</P>

<P class="Page">[Page 163]</P>

<P class="Para">It is interesting to observe that the <I>Bank of Canada Act, 1934 </I>(Dominion), establishes a central bank &quot;to regulate credit and
currency in the best interests of the economic life of the nation, to control
and protect the external value of the national monetary unit and to miti&shy;gate
by its influence fluctuations in the general level of production, trade, prices
and employment so far as may be possible within the scope of monetary action,
and generally to promote the economic and financial welfare of the
Dominion.&quot; No one doubts the constitutionality of this Act; in fact the
bill entitled <I>An Act to
amend and consolidate the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act </I>expressly exempts from its operations the Bank of Canada.</P>

<P class="Para">In essence the Alberta legislative scheme is one
to set up a new form of credit and currency within a single province.</P>

<P class="Para">I also concur in the reasons given by my Lord
the Chief Justice for holding as beyond the legislative competence of the
legislature the bills entitled respectively &quot;An Act respecting the
taxation of banks &quot;, and &quot; An Act to amend and consolidate the Credit
of Alberta Regulation Act.&quot;</P>

<P class="Para">I concur in the views of the other members of
the Court that the bill entitled &quot;An Act to ensure the publication of
accurate news and information&quot; is ultra vires, because it is ancillary to
and dependent upon the <I>Alberta
Social Credit Act, </I>but refrain from expressing any
views as to the boundaries of legislative authority as between the prov&shy;inces
and the Dominion in relation to the press. It is a problem with many facets
with which I hesitate to deal until presented to us in a more concrete form.</P>

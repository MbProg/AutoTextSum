<span class='header1'>A Tradition of Vigilance: The Role of Lieutenant Governor in Alberta</span>

<p>
<em>A contemporary misconception exists in Canada that the Governor General
 and the Lieutenant Governors are politically impotent. In fact, they have
 considerable power both of a legal and political nature. Using the province
 of Alberta as an example, this article looks at the ways various Lieutenant
 Governors have exercised the powers given to them by law and convention.&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>
The Lieutenant Governor was envisioned to function in a dualist role, as
 a representative of the monarch, but more clearly as a Dominion officer
 doing the bidding of the Federal Cabinet. Peter J.T. O&#146;Hearn recounts this
 office was by no means ceremonial,&nbsp; </p>
<p>
In the early days, some governors, notably in the new provinces, actually
 conducted the administration. There were exciting clashes in Quebec and
 British Columbia between strong-minded governors and their ministries,
 leading to the dismissal of five Cabinets. In the first half-century of
 Confederation, governors refused assent to twenty-six bills and reserved
 sixty-four for action in Ottawa.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The frustrations felt by the provinces lead them to challenge assertions
 that Lieutenant Governors possessed limited powers. &#147;From 1867 onwards,
 Oliver Mowat, the Premier of Ontario, attempted to change the notion of
 subordination of the Lieutenant Governor.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The fulcrum for Dominion interference was the Lieutenant Governor. Appointed
 and removed by the Dominion Government; considered by the Imperial Government
 as well as by the Dominion Government as merely a Dominion Officer mainly
 useful for bringing Provincial policies into harmony with those of the
 central Government; the Lieutenant Governor must have appeared to Mowat
 as likely to prove a &#147;Trojan Horse&#146; within the Provincial Citadel.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In <em>Liquidators of Maritime Bank v. Receiver General</em> (1892), the Judicial
 Committee of the Privy Council effectively reversed some twenty-five years
 of Constitutional law and practice. Until that point, the Lieutenant Governor
 was regarded primarily as a representative of the federal government. However,
 after the Maritime Bank went bankrupt, the New Brunswick government, eager
 to regain its funds, argued that the Lieutenant Governor was the representative
 of the monarch and possessed all of the prerogative powers of the Crown.
 This meant that the government of New Brunswick could use Crown prerogative
 as a basis for claiming priority over other creditors seeking to recover
 funds from the liquidators of the Maritime bank. The court agreed with
 this argument. &nbsp;The historical significance of this case lies in the fact
 that legally speaking the Lieutenant Governor would no longer be viewed
 as a Dominion Officer or in anyway subordinate to the central government.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Lieutenant Governor in Alberta&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
Alberta has a long history of interventionist Lieutenant Governors going
 back to the years of Social Credit and William Aberhart. The Social Credit
 period in Alberta, especially between 1936 and 1938, witnessed considerable
 intervention by both the Lieutenant Governor and the Governor General.
 In this period, several precedents were established on the role and authority
 of the Governor General and the Lieutenant Governor.&nbsp;
</p>


<p>
Early into Aberhart&#146;s term, the Lieutenant Governor was already expressing
 concerns over some legislation. On March 31, 1936, in a letter to the Premier,
 Walsh noted, &#147;I have a very great objection on principle to the enactment
 by Order-in-Council of legislation which should be enacted by statute.&#148;<sup>3</sup>
 Walsh continued to express his reservations noting &#147;I think that such legislation
 should be enacted only after full discussion in the open forum of the legislature
 by those elected for that purposes rather than in the Executive Council
 chamber by a few of those so elected.&#148;<sup>4</sup> Lieutenant Governor Walsh issued
 Aberhart this ultimatum: change the provisions of the Act or provide legal
 opinion regarding whether the law was <em>ultra vires</em>.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
Several months later Walsh once again threatened intervention. On August
 31, 1936, he wrote to Aberhart deeply troubled over a proposed Act relating
 to the reduction and settlement of debts. In the letter, Walsh expressed
 sympathy for the difficulties besetting the Aberhart government, but clearly
 outlined his objections, &#147;I cannot too strongly condemn the ruthless fashion
 in which the Act proposes to deal with the rights of creditors&#133;surely creditors
 have some rights in this country as well as debtors.&#148;<sup>5</sup> Walsh warned such
 legislation would further batter Alberta&#146;s damaged financial reputation
 and that the proposed Act might be <em>ultra vires</em> as it encroached upon the
 banking jurisdiction exclusive to the Dominion government. It was therefore
 possible that the Dominion government would disallow the legislation.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
Therefore, Walsh provided Aberhart with three options. First, delay the
 passing of the bill until the conclusion of the next session. Second, send
 the legislation for review to the Supreme Court of Alberta. Third, do nothing.
 In this event Walsh casually mentioned, &#147;I have the power under section
 55 of the <em>British North America Act</em> to reserve this bill for the signification
 of the Governor General's pleasure.&#148;<sup>6</sup> Walsh noted that, &#147;If however I find
 that I can constitutionally do so I will feel myself quite justified in
 reserving it.&#148;<sup>7</sup> In the end, Walsh elected not to withhold Royal Assent.
 &nbsp;The Supreme Court of Alberta did review this legislation, renamed the
 <em>Reduction and Settlement of Debts Act</em>. It is likely that Walsh &#150; a former
 Alberta Chief Justice and earnest opponent of the Act - played a role in
 alerting the courts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In February 1937, Mr. Justice A.F. Ewing of the Supreme Court of Alberta
 ruled the <em>Reduction and Settlement of Debts Act</em> unconstitutional. &nbsp;In June
 of that year, the provincial government was ultimately unsuccessful on
 appeal. On October 25, 1938, the appeal court refused to hear the Aberhart
 government&#146;s second appeal application. &nbsp;By 1937, the regularity of unconstitutional
 bills passed by the Alberta legislature made it necessary for a mode of
 intervention independent from time consuming judicial reviews: vice-regal
 intervention by both Alberta&#146;s Lieutenant Governor and Canada&#146;s Governor
 General.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Disallowance and Reservation&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
Alberta&#146;s longest serving Lieutenant Governor was John Campbell Bowen.
 His tenure illustrates that the Lieutenant Governor&#146;s efficacy in protecting
 of civil liberties and ensuring the constitutionality of provincial legislation.
 However, Bowen&#146;s insight and guardianship were not immediately apparent
 to his contemporaries. &nbsp;Bowen was roundly criticized during the Constitutional
 Crisis of 1937-38 for demonstrating weakness unbecoming of a Lieutenant
 Governor. Mackenzie King would note in his diary on February 1, 1938: &#147;&#133;had
 conservation with the Lieutenant Governor Bowen of Alberta who impressed
 me as a very delicate man, and not altogether suited for the post he occupies&#133;&#148;
 Nonetheless, he was largely able to overcome this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When William Aberhart assumed office of premier of Alberta in 1935, he
 asked for eighteen months to establish a new order, which would free Albertans
 from the economic evils of the Great Depression. &nbsp;By 1938, it was clear
 that Aberhart&#146;s measures had failed. &nbsp;In the meantime, Aberhart had raised
 serious alarm over his policies and legislation. On August 16, 1937, Arthur
 Meighen corresponded with Senator William Griesbach, foreshadowing the
 intervention of the Federal government and the Lieutenant Governor. &nbsp;&#147;What
 cannot be forgotten&#148; Meighen wrote, &#147;is that the people of Alberta are
 still citizens of Canada and they are still entitled to the safeguards
 of our Constitution. If Provincial legislation is always to be allowed
 to go unless upset by the courts, then the very sheet anchor of Confederation
 is gone.&#148;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In August 1937, Aberhart&#146;s government, eager to implement social credit
 economics passed the <em>Credit of Alberta Regulation Act</em>, the <em>Bank Employees
 Civil Rights Act</em> and the <em>Judicature Act Amendment Act</em>. In an early letter
 dated August 11, Prime Minister Mackenzie King had requested that William
 Aberhart first send the legislation for review to the Supreme Court of
 Canada to judge its constitutionality. Having already received Royal Assent
 of the Acts the previous day from the Lieutenant Governor, Aberhart refused.
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Major constitutional concerns were raised over the legislation even to
 the extent that the Lieutenant Governor should not have granted Royal Assent.
 For instance, the <em>Credit of Regulation Act</em> Section 7 stated that any banker
 &#147;&#133;while unlicensed, be capable of commencing or maintaining any action...in
 respect to any claim, in law or equity.&#148;<sup>9</sup>

The <em>Judicature Act Amendment
 Act</em> absurdly proposed what was tantamount to an unilateral Constitutional
 amendment by stating that<strong> </strong>&#147;No action or proceeding of any nature whatsoever
 concerning the Constitutional validity of any enactment of this Legislative
 Assembly of the Province shall be commenced, maintained, continued or defended,
 unless and until permission&#133;has first been given by the Lieutenant Governor
 in Council.&#148; The <em>Bank Employees Civil Rights Act</em> essentially denied any
 civil right of unlicensed employees of chartered banks. &nbsp;Bowen&#146;s decision
 not to reserve the Acts was called into question. Would, for example, William
 Walsh have granted Royal Assent to these three bills? Bowen&#146;s failure to
 intervene demonstrated some weakness, yet the subsequent federal disallowance
 certainly prompted an awakening of his guardianship of the Canadian Constitution.
 Following this incident, Bowen exhibited great care in granting Royal Assent
 and availed himself of independent legal advice.&nbsp;
</p>


<p>
This is not to say that Bowen remained unconcerned over the August 1937
 legislation. &nbsp;In fact, on the last day of session, August 6, Bowen called
 on Premier William Aberhart and the Attorney General John Hugill to discuss
 the constitutionality of the proposed Acts. In a rather bizarre turn of
 events, Hugill advised against Royal Assent. Hugill would later explain
 his position in a letter to Aberhart,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
On the afternoon of Friday, August 6th, 1937 shortly before the special
 session prorogued I went with you for an audience with the Lieutenant Governor
 in his room at his request. There I had the temerity to differ with the
 opinion you gave of the competence of our Provincial Legislature to enact
 certain Bills then awaiting His Honour&#146;s pleasure and upon which he sought
 our advice.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
A shocked Aberhart attempted to refute Hugill&#146;s opinion to Bowen despite
 lacking any legal experience or qualifications. Upon leaving the Lieutenant
 Governor&#146;s suite Aberhart suddenly fired his Attorney General. Of greater
 surprise, was Bowen&#146;s granting Royal Assent to the <em>Credit of Alberta Regulation
 Act</em>, the <em>Bank Employees Civil Rights Act </em>and the <em>Judicature Act Amendment
 Act</em>&#184; over the concerns of the Attorney General.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As foreshadowed earlier that year by Walsh, legislation that violated the
 Constitutional division of provincial and federal powers would result in
 disallowance by the Governor General-in-Council, which promptly occurred
 on August 17, 1937. Federal Justice Minister, Ernest LaPointe, remarked
 to the House of Commons, &#147;The statutes of Alberta in question constitute
 an unmistakeable invasion of the legislative field thus assigned to Parliament.
 They conflict with the dominion laws and virtually supplant dominion institutions
 designed by Parliament to facilitate the trade and commerce of the whole
 dominion.&#148;<sup>11</sup> Aberhart refused to fulfil his obligation to publish the disallowance
 in the <em>Alberta Gazette</em> so the federal government published the disallowance
 in the <em>Canada Gazette</em>.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
In response to the disallowance, James Mackinnon, Liberal MP for Edmonton
 West, and the only Liberal MP in Alberta, proposed a course of action for
 the Lieutenant Governor in September 1937. If Aberhart were to re-introduce
 the bills in the Legislative Assembly for the fall session, the Lieutenant
 Government should refuse Royal Assent. In the event that Aberhart asked
 for dissolution of the legislature with the intent of making the federal
 disallowance an election issue, the Lieutenant Governor should refuse the
 request and instead commission Alberta Liberal Leader E.L. Gray as Premier.
 Lieutenant Governor Bowen conveyed this plan to the federal government
 as Mackenzie King memorialized in his diary on September 28, 1937. &nbsp;&#147;The
 Lt. Gov. Bowen had written Lapointe,&#148; King wrote, &#147;indicating he might
 refuse dissolution if requested and possibly form a new ministry&#151;a mad
 course.&#148;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Ernest Lapointe had warned Lieutenant Governor Bowen that Aberhart might
 want to reintroduce the legislation. Elements of the disallowed legislation
 were reintroduced in legislation for the fall session. Perhaps predictably,
 the new legislation included new unconstitutional provisions. These were
 apparent in the <em>Bank Taxation Act, an Act to amend the Credit of </em>

<em>Alberta
 Regulation Act </em>and the <em>Act to ensure the publication of accurate news and
 information</em>. The <em>Bank Taxation Act</em> would allow the province, &#147;to levy taxes
 of one- half per cent per annum on all paid-up capital of the banks and
 one per cent per annum on their reserve funds and undivided profits.&#148;<sup>12</sup>
 The recently disallowed <em>Credit of Alberta Regulation Act</em> was &#147;rewritten
 to drop all reference to the banks and substitute the words &#145;credit institutions.&#146;
 All such credit institutions were to come under the direction of the Social
 Credit Board.&#148;<sup>13</sup> The <em>Accurate News and Information Act </em>was described by
 David Raymond Elliot.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
The <em>Accurate News and Information Act </em>required that every Alberta newspaper
 publish any statements furnished by the chair of the Social Credit party
 &#147;which has for its objective the correction or amplification of any statement
 relating to any policy or activity of the Government of the Province.&#148;
 The bill further directed that newspapers could be ordered to reveal in
 writing all sources of their information and the names and addresses of
 such sources &#133; [as well as] writers of &nbsp;any editorial, articles, or news
 item appearing in their papers. Failure to abide by this ruling would result
 in the prohibition of the publication of said newspaper, the prohibition
 of anything written by an offending writer and the prohibition of the publication
 of any information emanating from any offending person or source.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp; </p>


<p>
The new legislation generated further anxiety and concern in both Ottawa
 and Alberta. However, opinions on what to do in response were mixed among
 members of the federal Cabinet. Some Liberals thought that the legislation,
 rather than being disallowed, should be allowed to pass. The Banks themselves
 could challenge the legislation afterwards in the courts. King noted however,
 that as Liberals, they must uphold the constitution. The debate was settled
 in favour of LaPointe&#146;s view that &#147;&#133; the Lieutenant Governor should reserve
 any such legislation.&#148;<sup>15</sup> It was clear that the Lieutenant Governor was
 already onboard.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
On October 1, 1937, Bowen wrote to Aberhart with respect to the proposed <em>An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act</em>. Bowen
 noted, &#147;As Attorney General and one who is not versed in the Law, you could
 hardly be expected to give me legal advice, therefore I am asking that
 you be good enough to appoint an independent solicitor to review the said
 Bill for my information. In this respect I would suggest that you ask Mr
 Sidney B. Woods to do this for me.&#148;<sup>16</sup>

On October 6, 1937, the Lieutenant
 Governor announced his reservation of the <em>Bank Taxation Act, An Act to
 amend the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act</em> and the <em>Act to ensure the publication
 of accurate news and information</em> for the Governor General-in-Council who
 sent the bills on to the Supreme Court for review. The following spring
 the Supreme Court of Canada would determine that all three were in fact
 <em>ultra vires</em>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The hallmark of Federal legislative and vice-regal influence is evident
 on this reservation. On October 9, 1937, Mackenzie King met with Governor
 General Lord Tweedsmuir. &nbsp;After gossiping about the scandalous abdication
 of King Edward VIII, they settled into the matter of the Alberta Legislation,
 and, as Mackenzie King recounted in his diary,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
He asked me as to whether I had advised Bowen of Alberta re reserving bills.
 I told him of what he had written Lapointe and what I had advised Lapointe
 to do, having to dissuade him from the wrong course [of wanting to dismiss
 Aberhart]&#133;[Bowen had] proposed in discussing his position and leaving it
 to him to withhold or pass as he might wish.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It is clear that the Governor General held no objection to this course
 of action. While the King government supported Bowen, it did not force
 Bowen to reserve the legislation. Bowen was quite happy to do so, even
 proposing to dismiss Aberhart if necessary - a prospect that the Prime
 Minister was extremely uncomfortable with.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Aberhart government would also challenge the Governor General-in-Council&#146;s
 authority to disallow and the Lieutenant Governor&#146;s power to reserve legislation.
 On September 30, the Aberhart referred the question of disallowance to
 the Supreme Court of Canada. On October 2, the federal government accepted
 this referral. On March 4, 1938, the Supreme Court ruled that the powers
 of reservation and disallowance were &#147;subject to no limitation or restriction.&#148;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In Alberta, Aberhart was deeply upset at the Lieutenant Governor and publicly
 swore revenge. The Premier&#146;s rage and vindictive attitude nearly provoked
 another Constitutional Crisis. Bowen and Aberhart confronted each other
 again in the spring of 1938, this time over the closing of Government House,
 the Lieutenant Governor&#146;s official residence. &nbsp;The idea to close Government
 House had its origins in a grass-root Social Credit movement. The Social
 Credit membership, angered by the &#145;interference&#146; of the Lieutenant Governor,
 demanded Bowen&#146;s resignation. When it became apparent, the Lieutenant Governor
 would not resign, the Social Credit Party resolved to shutter up the vice-regal
 mansion.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In March 1938, the committee of supply of the Alberta Legislature took
 unequivocal action and eliminated all grants for the upkeep of Government
 House effective March 31, 1938. Government House, as the press widely reported,
 was to be closed. Unfortunately, nobody thought to tell Bowen. &nbsp;The Lieutenant
 Governor continued in residence forcing the government to fund Government
 House for the month of April through a special warrant Bowen signed himself.
 By the end of April, there was a more confrontational tone. The Lieutenant
 Governor was informed late Saturday April 29th that he would have to vacate
 Government House by May 3. The Lieutenant Governor refused to leave without
 an Order-in-Council. Aberhart argued that an Order-in-Council was not necessary.
 To end the standoff, Aberhart cut off the utilities to the building and
 fired the staff. Government House was beset by protestors. Other concerned
 citizens and Aberhart supporters wrote letters to the Lieutenant Governor
 attacking him. Bowen eventually capitulated, signed the Order-in-Council
 on May 6, and left Government House on May 9th.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Publicly humiliated, Bowen ensured he had the last word. As Norman Ward
 writes,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Publicly, Bowen did not challenge the government&#146;s right to dispossess
 him, claiming only that it must be done in the right way. Privately he
 was so upset that he had to take to his bed, where he brooded over possible
 courses of action. &nbsp;Deprived of even a secretary, he considered the humiliation
 of his office; &#147;he feels&#148;, a faithful correspondent (and Liberal organizer)
 reported on May 14 to James, &#147;that the Kings&#146; representative has been insulted
 to a point that might lead to grave consequences if allowed to go unchallenged.&#148;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp; </p>


<p>
The closing of Government House and the denial of administrative and other
 support by Aberhart angered the Lieutenant Governor. The Lieutenant Governor
 began to implement an accelerated version of the Mackinnon plan proposed
 in September 1937. Bowen approached E.L. Grey, the Alberta Liberal Leader
 who would note,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When I was first approached I was opposed to the idea. This situation is,
 however, so serious that I am inclined to believe it is my duty to step
 in. I feel that if something drastic is not done the Social Credit forces
 may have a solid western block in the very near future.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The removal of Aberhart and the end of Social Credit in Alberta seemed
 imminent. The Lieutenant Governor would forcibly remove the Premier from
 office.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
However, this plan reached the ears of Prime Minister Mackenzie King courtesy
 of the provincial Liberals, including E.L. Grey, &nbsp;who sought King&#146;s advice
 on the matter. On May 19, 1938, King noted in his diary,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Mackinnon came to the office to talk over the Alberta
 situation before going to Council. The present Lieutenant Governor wants
 to dismiss the Alberta ministry, and has asked Grey to form a ministry,
 which is to be one composed of the different political parties of the Province.
 It is sheer madness. Action of the kind would almost certainly have repercussions
 in Saskatchewan, which would cause the Liberals the election there, and
 might bring on a sort of civil war in Alberta. I had Gardiner phone Gray
 and MacKinnon phoned the Governor.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Aberhart&#146;s dismissal was averted as Mackenzie King persuaded Bowen to consider
 another course of action. Norman Ward has argued that, &#147;his near dismissal
 [of William Aberhart] was not a partisan matter, in which an unprincipled
 representative of the monarch sought to rid himself of a premier whose
 views he considered dangerous. Nor was it in essence the product of a Constitutional
 impasse which required the opening of a rarely used safety valve&#133;&#148;<sup>20</sup> Aberhart
 was &nbsp;nearly dismissed for his closure of Government House, the residence
 of the Lieutenant Governor, not because of a constitutional impasse.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Affronts to vice-regal ceremonial functions &#150; justified or not - can have
 serious political consequences, as politicians are liable to forget that
 they do not exercise power they merely grant advice to Her Majesty&#146;s representative.
 The Bowen example serves as a powerful example that no vice-regal should
 be ostracized. It also illustrates the tremendous power potentially wielded
 by a Lieutenant Governor. Some may argue that this incident was Bowen&#146;s
 abuse of vice-regal power. The author disagrees. &nbsp;However, even if such
 abuse were conceded, Bowen&#146;s actions not violate the written laws of the
 Constitution. Had Bowen&#146;s dismissed Aberhart, Aberhart would have had no
 recourse. It is possible, however, that Bowen might have found himself
 dismissed by the Governor General on the advice of Prime Minister Mackenzie
 King. King thought that any intervention would damage the chances of the
 provincial Liberals in the 1938 elections in Saskatchewan. Mackenzie King
 was not sympathetic to Aberhart, as he had noted in diary on October 1,
 1935, &#147;my feeling is that Aberhart should be hanged. His action has been
 bribery and corruption.&#148;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This tradition of vigilance established by Bowen is not merely an academic
 anachronism. It is an enduring part of Alberta&#146;s political memory, a legacy
 continued by Alberta Lieutenant Governors Ralph Steinhauer, Gordon Towers,
 Bud Olsen, Lois Hole and &#150; most recently &#150; Norman Kwong.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ralph Steinhauer shows his mettle&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
Throughout his tenure, Ralph Steinhauer, Alberta&#146;s first Aboriginal Lieutenant
 Governor, championed native rights in the province in opposition to the
 policies of Premier Peter Lougheed. On early example occurred in October
 1976. &nbsp;That month, Steinhauer delivered a controversial speech at the University
 of Calgary enumerating the injustices suffered by native people both past
 and present going so far as to raise the possibility of refusing assent
 to legislation that would be detrimental to native rights and interests.
 Steinhauer also described his frustration at being an aboriginal Lieutenant
 Governor, &#147;It [native affairs] has become a hot political issue but my
 lips now must be officially sealed on political questions-although sometimes
 I feel like I am going to blow up.&#148;<sup>21</sup> Nonetheless, Steinhauer felt a responsibility
 to &#147;depart from the traditional political neutrality.&#148;<sup>22</sup> Steinhauer also
 seemed aware that his outspoken behaviour might cost him his job, &#147;If I
 get too controversial, I suppose they will be looking for a new Lieutenant
 Governor.&#148;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In July 1976, several Alberta native chiefs joined Steinhauer at ceremonies
 hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace in commemoration of the signing
 of Treaties 6 and 7. Steinhauer had convinced Peter Lougheed to support
 and finance the trip and secured the Governor General&#146;s permission by asserting,
 &#147;it is the wish of the native people that a representative deputation of
 Chiefs&#133;should visit the United Kingdom.&#148;<sup>24</sup> Although, a Royal Visit to Canada
 was planned for the following year, Steinhauer argued, &#147;Alberta&#146;s Indians
 attach special significance to their being able to travel to visit her
 in her own home.&#148;<sup>25</sup> 
The Governor General&#146;s permission, however, was conditional.
 The Governor General and the federal government wanted assurance that the
 visit to England would not be a political event &#147;to draw attention to problems
 which are of concern to the Indian people of this country.&#148;<sup>26</sup> Steinhauer
 promised to ensure the occasion&#146;s political neutrality. &nbsp;Upon being presented
 to Her Majesty, however, Steinhauer promptly raised native issues for discussion.
&nbsp; </p>


<p>
Upon return to Edmonton, Steinhauer&#146;s account of the events in London appeared
 in a sympathetic article written by Jim Davies of the <em>Edmonton Journal</em>:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I was just stating facts. Because of the <em>Indian Act</em>, aren&#146;t we wards of
 the government? Isn&#146;t that a fact? You should read the act. Just about
 every clause begins &#145;With the consent of the governor-in-council the Indians
 shall&#133;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Steinhauer saw no incongruity between the Lieutenant Governor&#146;s role and
 political commentary, &#147;The Queen has the right to speak out. If I&#146;m the
 representative of the Queen here, I have the same privilege.&#148;<sup>28</sup> Steinhauer
 would also detail his philosophy on the role of the Lieutenant Governor.
 Having no regrets over his comments made in London Steinhauer would not
 make apologies, &#147;The truth has got to come out. When you state facts, things
 come out that are not that pleasant to the ears of government.&#148;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pondering Refusal of Assent&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
Controversy over First Nations concerns also came to a head over amendments
 to the <em>Land Titles Act</em>. As the <em>Calgary Albertan</em> reported on April 18, 1977,
 the amendments were aimed at,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&#133;blocking any attempt by Alberta Indians to declare an interest in land
 in the northern area of the province, including the Athabasca oil sands.
 A caveat declaring an interest in the lands was filed by some Indian bands
 in 1975 and a court hearing was due to be held. The provincial government,
 worried by comments made when the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on a similar
 point recently, rushed in with amendments to plug any possible loopholes
 that might favour the Indian case.<sup>30</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The Supreme Court decision in question was the <em>Paulette Caveat Case</em> in
 the Northwest Territories, which concerned the Alberta government to the
 extent that the Attorney General of Alberta unsuccessfully petitioned the
 court to intervene.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The proposed Bill 29, the <em>Land Title Amendment Act</em><em>,</em> would place restrictions
 on the filing of caveats on Crown land which option was frequently employed
 by native groups in securing land claims. The use of caveats was &#147;an attempt
 to forbid registration of any person as Transferee of ownership of, or
 of any instrument affecting the said estate or interest.&#148;<sup>31</sup> 
 Native groups
 could file a caveat preventing the development or sale of land until their
 land claim challenges were resolved. The most disconcerting caveat in the
 eyes of the provincial government was the Syncrude or Whitehead Caveat,
 which threatened to delay oil sands development and transfer ownership
 of the land from the Crown to natives including mineral and surface rights
 as guaranteed by treaty. Lieutenant Governor Steinhauer spoke against the
 legislation and hinted that he was considering withholding Royal Assent.
 Steinhauer had been asked to refuse Royal Assent by native leaders including
 the prominent leader of The M&#233;tis Association of Alberta, Stan Daniels
 whose press release of May 2, 1977 read,&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In our opinion, this bill is directed against Native People and infringes
 on the Federal Governments right to legislate in the area of Native Affairs.
 By denying us the right to file a caveat, the Provincial Government is
 saying that the native people don&#146;t have an aboriginal right. These rights
 have been recognized in the Treaties and settlements given to both registered
 and non-registered Native people over the last 100 years.<sup>32</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The Alberta Human Rights and Civil Liberties Association apprised the Lieutenant
 Governor of their objections on May 5, 1977 recommending the Alberta Attorney
 General refer the legislation to the Alberta Supreme Court to determine
 whether it violated the <em>Alberta Bill of Rights</em>. The Association added,
 &#147;it was suggested by several native groups that you may, in fact, feel
 obligated to resign rather than give Royal Assent to this Bill.&#148;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Steinhauer refused to resign over the matter noting later that he would
 sign the legislation &#147;If the Bill is within the constitution, I have no
 choice, I have to sign&#133;I checked into it.&#148;<sup>34</sup> In fact, the Lieutenant Governor
 did not get the best possible advice on the matter. While the changes to
 the <em>Land Titles Act</em> did not explicitly violate any section of the <em>B.N.A
 Act, 1867</em>, the legislation did violate the spirit, or convention, of the
 Constitution. &nbsp;The new legislation prevented natives from obtaining rights
 guaranteed under other Constitutional documents, the native treaties. The
 Crown had failed to uphold their treaty obligations under Treaty 6, 7 and
 8, such as providing reserve land.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
However, Steinhauer did eventually conclude that Bill 29 did not stifle
 native land claims, &#147;The bill does not completely kill the rights of the
 Indian people to negotiate land claims,&#148; as there was &#147;a way around&#148; the
 revisions, &#147;In any case it&#146;s a caveat worth the paper it&#146;s written on?
 It&#146;s just a stalling procedure.&#148;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Soon thereafter, allegations arose that Premier Lougheed had petitioned
 Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to restrain Lieutenant Governor Steinhauer.
 Grant Notley, leader of the Alberta New Democrats, raised the question
 of whether or not Lougheed had intervened in the Alberta Legislature. &#147;In
 light of statements attributed to His Honour the Lieutenant Governor concerning
 federal requests that he restrain public comments, particularly with respect
 to native questions, is the Premier in a position to assure the Legislature
 that at no time was there any provincial representation to federal authorities
 with respect to statements made by His Honour?&#148;<sup>36</sup> Lougheed balked at answering
 the question in the House arguing that such questions violated the privileges
 of the House.&nbsp; </p>


<p>
Steinhauer later admitted to getting in to &#147;hot water,&#148; resulting in an
 order from Ottawa (not Edmonton) to &#147;cool his mouth off.&#148;<sup>37</sup> Steinhauer
 described the threshold for his outspokenness, &#147;In this job you can speak
 out providing you don&#146;t condemn too much.&#148;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Had he chosen to refuse Royal Assent, would Steinhauer have been justified?
 &nbsp;It is an important question. Had Canadian politicians adequately addressed
 native problems? On November 6, 1981, Eugene Steinhauer, President of the
 Indian Association of Alberta and brother of the former Lieutenant Governor,
 wrote to Premier Peter Lougheed noting that the provincial government had
 ratified the Constitution binding native groups without consultation,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We understand that Dick Johnston, of your office, has gone to England to
 talk about our Rights. In this case we must tell you that the Alberta government
 has no legal or Constitutional jurisdiction to speak on our behalf in England.<sup>39</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Minority rights must be protected and the Lieutenant Governor, as a guardian
 of the Constitution, is bound to ensure such protections. &nbsp;A Lieutenant
 Governor with a strong consideration for native rights might have provided
 recourse for natives and averted the travesty of failing to include Canada&#146;s
 first nations in the Constitutional negotiations of 1978 to 1982. It is
 doubtful that Lougheed would have been able to proceed in this manner had
 Steinhauer still been Lieutenant Governor.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Refusing Orders-in-Council&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
Keith Brownsey has compared the number of bills passed by the Alberta Legislature
 with the number of orders-in-council signed by the Lieutenant Governor.
 In 2004, there were 591 Orders-in-Councils, but only 35 bills. While the
 passing of bills involves debate, the issuing of Orders-in-Councils does
 not. Some of the Orders-in-Council issued by the Klein government were
 substantial in scope and they included, &#147;regulations for the generation,
 sale and transmission of electricity, the creation of regional health districts,
 and back-to-work legislation for teachers.&#148;<sup>40</sup> Many of these measures, along
 with other Orders-in-Councils, should have been submitted as bills and
 withstood public scrutiny.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Circumventing the Legislature is part of the problem with the parliamentary
 process in Alberta. Alberta&#146;s history of large majority governments has
 entrenched the practice of public spending via Orders-in-Council the approval
 of which is at the discretion of the Lieutenant Governor. &nbsp;Some Alberta
 Lieutenant Governors have felt compelled to remind the executive that this
 process subverts and circumvents the democratic process. Two of the Lieutenant
 Governors that served in the 1990s raised concerns on the way the government
 uses Orders-in-Council.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In February 1993, Lieutenant Governor Gordon Towers refused the advice
 of one of his Alberta ministers when he declined to sign an Order-in-Council
 that he felt inappropriate. The Order-in-Council was a 1.5 million grant
 proposed by Economic Development Minister Ken Kowalski. Gordon Towers noted,
 &#147;If I hadn&#146;t had the situation corrected within the department, within
 the ministers, within the Cabinet, then I would have gone to the Premier&#133;&#148;<sup>41</sup>
 Towers insisted the Office of Lieutenant Governor &#147;is not just a rubber
 stamp.&#148;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
At least one Alberta cabinet minister expressed surprise at Lieutenant
 Governor Tower&#146;s intervention. Ernie Isley, who had brought forth the Order-in-Council
 noted, &#147;I was not surprised he had the power&#133;but I was surprised he used
 the authority . . . I can remember him holding it up and a subsequent discussion
 on it ... He was justified in feeling comfortable before he signed it.&#148;<sup>43</sup>
 Liberal Treasury Critic Mike Percy noted at the time that Tower&#146;s actions
 exhibited &#147;the integrity of the lieutenant-governor. It was the right thing
 to do.&#148;<sup>44</sup> 
Despite the fact that Lieutenant Governor Gordon Towers, and
 his successor Bud Olsen, were from different political parties, they shared
 the same concerns over the use of special warrants and Orders-in-Council.
 Lieutenant Governor Bud Olson noted concern,&nbsp; </p>
<p>
that the government had resorted to paying its bills in the past without
 legislature scrutiny &#145;because that to me is wrong.&#146; He made it clear that,
 unless it was an emergency situation, he would view dimly any special warrants
 that cross his desk and hinted strongly he could refuse to sign, &#145;It would
 be very, very tempting to say,&#146; &#145;Try this in the legislature first and
 see what they think of it&#133;That&#146;s what I would be tempted to say and I think
 I&#146;m in my Constitutional duty doing it that way.&#146;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp; </p>


<p>
<strong>Recent Examples of Intervention&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
One need look no further than the two most recent incumbents, Lois Hole
 and Norman Kwong for examples of intervention by Alberta Lieutenant Governors.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Early in her term, Hole prompted a fierce political debate over the role
 of the Lieutenant Governor with comments on Bill 11, which would have permitted
 the privatization of some health care services. Her Honour&#146;s comments came
 on March 15, 2000, during a charity event in Red Deer. Hole admitted that,
 although her family typically chose not to talk politics with her, her
 son had asked: &#147;What will you do with the health bill?&#148;<sup>46</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
It is clear the remark was not intended to threaten the Premier with a
 withholding of royal assent. As Ken Munro has noted, &#147;The innocent comment
 soon became blown out of all proportion with some mischievous individuals
 in the press suggesting that the Lieutenant Governor was going to refuse
 assent if &#147;Bill 11&#148; passed through the Legislative process.&#148;<sup>47</sup> Nancy Macbeth,
 the Liberal leader, noted that while Hole&#146;s comments were unusual for a
 Lieutenant Governor, they nonetheless had merit: &#147;She&#146;s close to the people
 and hearing that they&#146;re saying and the government isn&#146;t.&#148;<sup>48</sup> 
Regardless
 of the Lieutenant Governor&#146;s intentions, a debate arose over the Lieutenant
 Governor&#146;s right to express personal opinion.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
At the time, Constitutional scholars such as Allan Tupper commented on
 the Lieutenant Governor&#146;s right to refuse the advice of the Premier on
 assenting to legislation. &nbsp;As Tupper wrote, &#147;&#133;my view is that a Lieutenant
 Governor not giving assent to a bill passed by a majority government would
 be unconstitutional. I would go past that and say that it&#146;s no longer an
 operative part of the Canadian Constitution.&#148;<sup>49</sup> However, laws are not made
 inoperative by lack of use; laws must be amended or repealed. &nbsp;Popular
 opinion seemed to disagree. &nbsp;The 
 <em>Edmonton Journal</em> editorialized thus: &#147;As
 Lieutenant Governor, it is her job &#150; indeed, her primary responsibility
 &#150; to remain aloof from the political debates that occasionally divide members
 of the legislature and the people who democratically chose them in an election.&#148;<sup>50</sup>

 At odds with this sentiment, however, is the Lieutenant Governor&#146;s job
 description as provided by the <em>Constitution Act</em>, 1867. Hole&#146;s comments
 were merely conveying to the public that as Lieutenant Governor she would
 be ensuring that the Premier realized that the legislation was controversial
 and that there was widespread opposition to it. She ensured that the Premier
 would have the best interests of Albertans in mind.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Another reporter with the <em>Edmonton Journal</em> noted Lois Hole&#146;s Bill 11 comments
 were a &#147;break with tradition.&#148;<sup>51</sup> However, where did this so-called tradition
 originate? The reactions provided by political observers seemed rather
 unusual considering that Alberta has had a tradition of interventionist
 Lieutenant Governors since it had become a province.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
On January 21, 2005 during his installation ceremony at Government House,
 Alberta&#146;s new Lieutenant Governor, Norman Kwong, provoked controversy over
 his comments on Alberta&#146;s proposed smoking ban. Kwong openly disagreed
 with Premier Klein who felt that a province-wide smoking ban in public
 places and work environments was unfair. Klein had noted, &#147;Let&#146;s not be
 overboard on this issue.&#148;<sup>52</sup> The Premier also felt that those employed in
 a smoking environment should find another job if they found the practice
 distasteful. The new Lieutenant Governor hoped his comments would encourage
 youngsters not to adopt the harmful practice, &#147;I hate to jump on people,
 the way they live their lives&#133;But if you asked me if I was in favour or
 not, I think I&#146;d have to be in favour of a ban.&#148;<sup>53</sup> 
While these comments
 were contrary to the Premier&#146;s position &nbsp;they did not conflict with the
 established positions of several government departments and organizations,
 which found the proposed ban helpful to the general health of Alberta&#146;s
 citizenry. Iris Evans, Klein&#146;s own health minister, had proposed the smoking
 ban. The proponents for the smoking ban included AADAC (Alberta Alcohol
 and Drug Abuse Commission) whose senior manager for tobacco reduction Lloyd
 Carr argued, &#147;The more you limit the places where people can smoke, the
 more quit attempts they will make.&#148;<sup>54</sup> The Chief Medical Officer for the
 Capital Health Region concurred with the ban, &#147;In terms of preventing exposure
 to environmental (second-hand) tobacco smoke, particularly for people who
 are working in places like bars, I think it is important to have a smoking
 ban.&#148;<sup>55</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Under such pressure, Klein was forced to admit that he was in the minority
 and rather than dismissing the smoking ban with an executive veto. Klein
 promised instead to consult his caucus, &#147;We will have a debate through
 the (standing) policy committees, and I will make sure that those are open,
 and then in the legislature.&#148;<sup>56</sup> In an effort to ensure that children were
 not becoming smokers, Kwong provided open support to a majority in favour
 of a ban helping to force a more democratic resolution of the issue. &nbsp;And
 despite provincially employed experts weighing in on the issue to the detriment
 of the Premier&#146;s position, somehow the Lieutenant Governor&#146;s comments were
 seen as inappropriate. The
 <em>Regina Leader Post</em> reported that &#147;newly appointed
 Alberta Lt.-Gov. &nbsp;Norman Kwong shunned royal protocol and waded into the
 contentious smoking debate Thursday, publicly disagreeing with Premier
 Ralph Klein&#146;s stand opposing a province- wide ban on smoking in public
 places and at work.&#148;<sup>57</sup> Larry Johnrude and Bill Mah of the <em>Edmonton Journal</em>
 noted almost verbatim, the criticism of the <em>Leader Post.</em> Clearly, the shunning
 of royal protocol was a disastrous offence from the media&#146;s perspective,
 but the shunning of democratic debate by the Premier was less so. The criticisms
 were echoed by members of the general public including one Thomas Koch
 of Spring Lake, Alberta, who criticized the Lieutenant Governor,&nbsp; </p>


<p>
Under a Constitutional democracy, the role of the monarch and her representatives
 is largely ceremonial and involves political activity only in dissolving
 the legislature and swearing in of democratically elected representatives&#133;Kwong
 might consider cutting a few ribbons, hosting a few afternoon teas and
 leave the politics to the voters and their elected representatives.<sup>58</sup>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Koch had failed to note that it was the democratic majority that favoured
 the ban, a fact that would be subsequently seen when the smoking ban was
 passed in the Legislature. &nbsp;The whole controversy was perhaps exaggerated
 but if we view democracy as being the will of the people the Lieutenant
 Governor was not going against the democratic process. He was supporting
 it.&nbsp;

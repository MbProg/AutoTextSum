Tiflis Stagecoach Robbery - Starring Joseph Stalin?
In the early days of Russia’s Bolshevik Revolution, bandits like Joseph Stalin paid for their activities through an old-fashioned form of fundraising: bank robbery. Stalin’s involvement in the 1907 Tiflis robbery, other than planning it, is disputed, and different stories have him doing everything from personally throwing bombs at police to calmly standing off to the side smoking his pipe. 

What’s not in dispute is that a group of Bolsheviks attacked a stagecoach carrying over 300,000 rubles (now valued at over $3 million) to the Tiflis branch of the State Bank of the Russian Empire. A gunfight broke out and 40 robbers, guards, and civilians were either shot dead or blown up by bombs. And it was all for naught: the notes had been marked, so they were useless to the robbers. Only one man was ever tried for the crime - who was latter killed in an accident that Stalin might have orchestrated.

"You can’t regret your fate, although I do regret my mother didn’t marry a carpenter."
Let's be honest... svetlana was his only LEGITIMATE daughter.
We are talking about an ex-gangster/bank robber and a known lothario here
There are quite a few oddities about this statement.
Firstly, there are no known records of other illegitimate children, so it's just rampant speculation.
Secondly, he's not a known 'lothario'.
Thirdly he wasn't a gangster, he was a revolutionary.
Fourthly gangsters and bank robbers aren't known to have a predilection for extramarital sex that I'm aware of.
Fifthly you seem to be trying to cast aspersion on his character by saying he's a gangster/bank robber, while missing, gosh I don't know, the deaths of tens of millions of russians under his totalitarian rule.

I think spicynuts calls Stalin a bank robber because he organized the Tiflis bank robbery.
And calling him a lothario might be in reference to his affair with a 13-year-old orphaned girl, Lidia Pereprygina which resulted in two illegitimate children (in addition to Konstantin).
Also Alvasi Talakvadze, Ludmilla Stal, Natasha Kirtava, Pelageya Onufrieva, Serafima Khoroshenina, Stefania Petrovskaya, another orphan Tatiana Slavatinskaya, and Valentina Lobova.
A lot of this is in Montefiore's award-winning Young Stalin.
He caused the death of thousands and organized a bank robbery and had lots of sex with lots of women.

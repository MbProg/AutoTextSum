The Most Daring Heists in History
List Criteria: All of the robberies on this list are bold or risky in some way that goes beyond a standard bank robbery.
Anyone can walk into a bank with a gun and demand some money, but this list is about the biggest bank heists in history, and those take a little more thought. To really make your mark as a bank robber, you've got to go above and beyond just putting on a little black mask and handing a teller a note to put some cash in a sack with a dollar sign on it.
You've got to think big, both in terms of how much you steal and how you do it. And the bandits on this list have thought big in both of those categories. They've dug tunnels under banks, blown up walls and safes with bombs, and landed on cash vault roofs in helicopters. Not only that, but they haven't just knocked off a few thousand dollars, but they've stolen millions of dollars in cash, gold and gems - in one case, they took close to a billion.
And forget going solo, these posses have multiple guys, in some cases, more than a dozen. A few of these heists may have even benefitted from the help of a dictator! Here are the biggest and most daring bank and cash heists in history. Upvote the heists you wouldn't even try in a million years, but are pretty impressed these people managed to attempt, or even accomplish!

The Most Daring Heists in History
List Criteria: All of the robberies on this list are bold or risky in some way that goes beyond a standard bank robbery.
Anyone can walk into a bank with a gun and demand some money, but this list is about the biggest bank heists in history, and those take a little more thought.
To really make your mark as a bank robber, you've got to go above and beyond just putting on a little black mask and handing a teller a note to put some cash in a sack with a dollar sign on it.
You've got to think big, both in terms of how much you steal and how you do it.
And the bandits on this list have thought big in both of those categories.
They've dug tunnels under banks, blown up walls and safes with bombs, and landed on cash vault roofs in helicopters.
Not only that, but they haven't just knocked off a few thousand dollars, but they've stolen millions of dollars in cash, gold and gems - in one case, they took close to a billion.
And forget going solo, these posses have multiple guys, in some cases, more than a dozen.
A few of these heists may have even benefitted from the help of a dictator!
Here are the biggest and most daring bank and cash heists in history.
Upvote the heists you wouldn't even try in a million years, but are pretty impressed these people managed to attempt, or even accomplish!

The Lufthansa Heist

Immortalized (though not actually shown) in the gangster classic Goodfellas, the Lufthansa Heist happened in December 1978 and was the largest robbery committed in the United States at the time.
After getting into a cargo loading area at Kennedy Airport with a key provided by an inside man, Jimmy Burke and his crew burst into a lunch room and ordered the staff to open the vault at gunpoint.
Within an hour, they made off with $6 million in cash and close to a million in jewels that had been flown in from Germany.
And, just like in the movie, Burke (named Conway in the film, and played by Robert De Niro) began killing off everyone involved with the heist to keep from being caught.
Most of the money and all of the jewels were lost - and of the dozens of hoods involved in the heist, only one was ever arrested for it.

The Banco Central Tunnel Robbery

A group of Brazilian burglars dug a 200 meter long tunnel under the vault of Fortelaza’s Banco Central in 2005.
After three months of digging, the gang crawled beneath two city blocks to get to the bank, blasted their way through a meter of steel-reinforced concrete and emptied out the vaults.
Nearly $65 million was stolen, and the money wasn’t insured.
Some of the cash was eventually recovered, and one of the masterminds of the robbery was found dead a while later, but 18 other culprits were never brought to justice.

"DB Cooper"

On Thanksgiving Eve, 1971, a hijacker who called himself Dan Cooper (the name "DB Cooper" was bestowed on him by the media who mistook a suspect with that name for the real Cooper) boarded a Northwest Airlines flight in Portland, OR wearing a suit and tie.
Once the flight was aloft, he ordered a drink and passed a note to the stewardess saying, "I have a bomb in my briefcase.
You are being hijacked."
He demanded $200,000 in unmarked bills, two parachutes, and a fuel truck.
When the plane landed in Seattle, "Cooper" exchanged the hostages on the plane for the money and parachutes and ordered the plane to take off again.
30 minutes into the flight, "Cooper" deployed the back stairs of the airplane, jumped out and neither he nor the money has been seen since.
The crime remains unsolved.

The Billion Dollar Baghdad Bank Burgle

In what’s generally thought of as the biggest bank robbery in history , just before the American invasion of Iraq in March, 2003, one of President Saddam Hussein's sons stole nearly $1 billion in cash from the country's Central Bank - thanks to a note from his daddy.
Qusay Hussein had a handwritten letter from his father demanding to be given all of the cash in the Baghdad Central Bank (for "safekeeping), and his demands were met.
Three trailers full of American cash were taken away over a five hour period and Qusay went into hiding.
About two thirds of the cash was eventually recovered, found behind a fake wall in the palace of Saddam’s other son, Uday.
The rest vanished.

Brinks-MAT Robbery

Thanks to a tip from an insider, six men broke into the Brinks MAT warehouse at London’s Heathrow Airport in November 1983, expecting to find £3 million worth of cash.
What they found instead was a massive haul, including three tons of gold and 100,000 diamonds.
The gang beat up and hogtied the guards, poured gasoline on them and forced them to reveal the combination on the facility’s vault.
Then they escaped in a van so weighed down that the bottom scraped the ground.
Two of the culprits were eventually arrested, and nearly 20 people with connections to the crime (including a man involved with the Great Train Robbery) were murdered in the decades that followed.
Most of the gold was never found, and was probably smelted and sold back to dealers.

The Great Train Robbery

A heist so brazen it permeated British pop culture for decades, the Great Train Robbery probably would have been a success if the robbers hadn’t been such idiots.
Early morning on August 8, 1963, 15 men clad in ski masks and helmets held up a Royal Mail train, beat the engineer with a pipe and stole 120 mail sacks carrying over $2 million worth of cash, mostly old bills meant to be destroyed.
The crew retired to a farmhouse 120 miles away, drinking and playing Monopoly with the cash, then torching the place.
But they did a bad torch job, and police found enough evidence to nab virtually the entire gang.
11 of the 15 men got 30 years in prison, though one, Ronnie Biggs, escaped and became a minor celebrity in England.

The Knightsbridge Security Depot Heist

The Knightsbridge Security Deposit Bank in London was well known for having famous and wealthy clients, so it had a large amount of cash and jewels on hand.
Valerio Viccei and a small gang of robbers, using inside information from one of the bank's managers, got into a vault on the pretense of renting a safe deposit box.
Then they pulled guns, tied up the guards and hung up a sign declaring that the bank was closed.
Viccei and his crew ransacked the bank to the tune of nearly $200 million in cash and gems, then made a run for it.
Viccei went into hiding and almost got away with it, but he was captured when he went back to England - to retrieve his Ferrari.

Using insider information from an employee of the Bank of France in Toulon, a gang of 10 men hit the bank hard in 1992.
They kidnapped a guard's family and strapped explosives to the man’s body before forcing him to open the bank's vaults.
Once inside, the gang emptied the vaults of 160 million francs and escaped in a group of vans.
Most of the culprits were caught, but only about 10% of the haul was ever found.
The mastermind of the crime hanged himself in prison.

The Dar Es Salaam Bank Heist

Just four years after the Baghdad Bank was hit, the smaller Dar Es Salaam bank, also in Baghdad, was robbed – by the three Iraqi security guards working the overnight shift.
When the bank’s employees came into work the morning of July 12, 2007, they found the front door open, the bank vault doors ajar and the bank's $282 million in American cash gone.
It's believed that the men had help from local militias in escaping the numerous checkpoints around the city, and neither the culprits nor the cash have ever turned up.

The North Hollywood Shootout

Larry Phillips, Jr. and Emil Mătăsăreanu had already robbed several banks and killed a Brinks truck driver when they walked into the Bank of America branch on Laurel Canyon Boulevard in North Hollywood.
They carried an arsenal of assault rifles and pistols, and wore high-tech body armor.
Once inside, they blew off the door of the bank’s vault, stole $300,000 and emptied a drum of ammo into the rest of the money.
Police responded almost instantly, and the two men opened fire .
With the police outgunned, the robbers were able to survive multiple bullet hits and make it almost six blocks away.
After a hellacious shootout, Phillips was shot in the head and killed, and Mătăsăreanu died of blood loss from over 20 bullet wounds in his legs.
They had fired 1,100 rounds, as opposed to 650 by the woefully under-armed police and SWAT team members.

The British Bank of the Middle East Plunder

On January 20, 1976, a gang of PLO robbers working with a sect of fundamentalist Christians (robbery makes for strange bedfellows) broke into the British Bank of the Middle East in Beirut, Lebanon.
No skill or trickery was employed, as they simply blasted through a wall and burst in with guns.
As Lebanon was engulfed in civil war, nobody really noticed or cared what was happening, and the group occupied the bank for several days while they tried to crack the main vault.
They finally enlisted a group of Corsican safecrackers to bust in, and once it was done, they plundered its contents.
The bandits made off with anywhere from $20 million to $50 million worth of gold bars, currency, stocks, and jewels.
The vast majority of the haul was never recovered.

Northern Bank Robbery

The ransacking of the Northern Bank headquarters in Belfast is considered one of the largest bank heists in UK history, nabbing nearly $40 million worth of cash.
The night before it happened, a pair of robbers visited the homes of two Northern Bank officials, dressed as police officers.
They took the managers’ families hostage, and demanded access to the vaults, which they then plundered after business hours.
The Irish and UK governments blamed the Irish Republican Army, who vehemently denied any involvement.
The heist still remains unsolved, and Northern Bank had to recall and reissue hundreds of millions of pounds worth of cash to prevent the loot from being spent.

Tiflis Stagecoach Robbery - Starring Joseph Stalin?
f t p @ X

In the early days of Russia’s Bolshevik Revolution, bandits like Joseph Stalin paid for their activities through an old-fashioned form of fundraising: bank robbery.
Stalin’s involvement in the 1907 Tiflis robbery , other than planning it, is disputed, and different stories have him doing everything from personally throwing bombs at police to calmly standing off to the side smoking his pipe.
What’s not in dispute is that a group of Bolsheviks attacked a stagecoach carrying over 300,000 rubles (now valued at over $3 million) to the Tiflis branch of the State Bank of the Russian Empire.
A gunfight broke out and 40 robbers, guards, and civilians were either shot dead or blown up by bombs.
And it was all for naught: the notes had been marked, so they were useless to the robbers.
Only one man was ever tried for the crime - who was latter killed in an accident that Stalin might have orchestrated.

The Securitas Bank cash depot heist in Kent was the largest cash robbery in UK history, and started when the depot's manager was abducted.
When he pulled over for an unmarked police vehicle with blue flashing lights, a man approached the manager's car, handcuffed him, and threw him into a waiting vehicle.
The robbers then held the man’s wife and son hostage, tied up 14 other employees and plundered the depot for the equivalent of $92.5 million.
As a final insult, the manager and his family were locked in the bank cages after the robbery.
Despite the brazen nature of their crime, the gang, including a former soldier and a cage fighter, was quickly apprehended.

The Swedish Helicopter Heist

A group of masked gunmen raided a cash depot in Sweden using a small arsenal of bombs and gear – including a helicopter.
Just before sunrise on September 23, 2009, the burglars landed on the rooftop of the GS4 cash depot, smashed the glass roof, blasted their way through the building's vault, and used mountain climbing gear to hoist themselves and their cash back up to the helicopter.
Even with all that, the robbers had one more trick up their sleeves: distracting Swedish police with a fake bomb planted at a nearby helipad.
How fake was it?
It was literally a bag with the word "BOMB” written on it.
So much cash was taken that the Swedish government was concerned the country’s ATMs would run out of money.
The entire group was eventually tracked down and convicted.

The Dunbar Armored Car Robbery

Dunbar employee Allen Pace ganged up with five childhood friends to steal $18.9 million from his employers in 1997.
While on the job, Pace made detailed plans of the armored car depot, timing the rotation of the security cameras to avoid detection.
He used his keys to enter the facility, then waited with his pals in the cafeteria, ambushing each guard as they came in until the vault was unguarded.
The gang loaded millions into a nearby truck and made a run for it.
The crime was unsolved for several years until one of the accomplices gave an associate a stack of money with the original cash straps, for the purposes of laundering.
The cash was quickly traced to Pace’s crew, and the associate ratted everyone out.
Only $9 million was ever recovered.

On May 9, 1980, five men walked into the Norco, CA branch of Security Pacific Bank.
They carried shotguns, assault rifles, pistols, and a crude bomb – and had 15 more bombs in their getaway van.
Four barged into the bank and demanded $20,000 in cash, while the fifth kept watch.
While they were armed to the teeth, they were also in broad daylight, and an employee at a bank across the street called the police.
So began a running battle that went from the bank to the streets outside to a wooded area near the bank.
Thousands of bullets and a dozen homemade bombs were used, and close to three dozen vehicles were damaged.
When it was over, two of the gunmen and one police officer were killed, and the other three robbers were sentenced to life in prison.

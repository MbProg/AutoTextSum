<h2>BACKGROUNDER ON THE COURT JUDGEMENT OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF CALIFORNIA V. BAKKE CASE</h2>

<P>Following passage of the 1964 and 1965 Civil Rights acts, President
Johnson came to believe that it was not enough just to remove legal barriers
confronting minorities; some form of affirmative action would be needed
to help minorities overcome decades of prior discrimination. On September
24, 1965, Johnson issued an executive order requiring federal contractors
to take affirmative action to recruit, hire and promote more racial minorities;
two years later, in another executive order, Johnson added women to the
groups covered by previous antidiscrimination orders.</P>

<P>Affirmative action became one of the most divisive issues of the 1970s
and 1980s, and yet the debate over affirmative action can also be seen
as part of the process of democracy. Put in starkest terms, proponents
of affirmative action argue that because of prior discrimination in education
and employment, women and minorities are handicapped when they apply to
good schools, seek decent jobs or look for promotions. Therefore, to overcome
the results of this past discrimination, colleges and employers ought to
give some sort of preferred treatment to minorities, either by actively
seeking minority applicants or by setting up a quota of jobs or school
spaces reserved for women and minorities. Only by making this effort to
bring minorities into the mainstream, goes the argument, can the effects
of decades of discrimination finally be erased.</P>

<P>Opponents do not deny that there has been discrimination in the past,
but argue that the white male who must lose his chance at entrance to a
particular college or job is being penalized unfairly. He had nothing to
do with slavery one or two centuries ago, and may not have anything to
do with discriminatory practices today. Why should an individual be penalized
for what the society has done; conversely, why should the individual minority
member benefit today for what was done to his or her ancestors decades
ago?</P>

<P>The question came to the Supreme Court, and in the initial decision,
the Court split, with four members asserting that affirmative action plans
involving racial classification were permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment,
and four others claiming that any racial considerations violated the 1964
Civil Rights Act. Justice Lewis Powell believed that some affirmative action
plans, if carefully crafted, could pass both constitutional and statutory
scrutiny, and he shaped a classic transitional decision. Race could be
a factor, but only one of many, used to seek a balance. The decision did
not really answer the questions raised by affirmative action, but paved
the way for the Court and the society to adopt some affirmative action
plans, and to begin the debate over just how far to go in this difficult
area.</P>

(1973); Allen P. Sindler, Bakke, DeFunis and Minority Admissions: The Quest

<hr>

<P>REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA V. BAKKE (1978)</P>

<h3>Justice Powell announced the judgement of the Court.</h3>

<P>This case presents a challenge to the special admissions program of
the petitioner, the Medical School of the University of California at Davis,
which is designed to assure the admission of a specified number of students
from certain minority groups. The Supreme Court of California held the
special admissions program unlawful, enjoined petitioner from considering
the race of any applicant, and ordered Bakke's admission. For the reasons
stated in the following opinion, I believe that so much of the judgement
of the California court as holds petitioner's special admissions program
unlawful and directs that respondent be admitted to the Medical School
must be affirmed. For reasons expressed in a separate opinion, my Brother
The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and Mr.
Justice Stevens concur in this judgment. I also conclude for the reasons
stated in the following opinion that the portion of the court's judgement
enjoining petitioner from according any consideration to race in its admissions
process must be reversed. For reasons expressed in separate opinions, my
Brothers Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall,
and Mr. Justice Blackmun concur in this judgement.</P>

<P>Affirmed in part and reversed in part...</P>

<P>Because the special admissions program involved in a racial classification,
the supreme court [of California] held itself bound to apply strict scrutiny.
It then turned to the goals the University presented as justifying the
special program. Although the court agreed that the goals of integrating
the medical profession and increasing the number of physicians willing
to serve members of minority groups were compelling state interests, it
concluded that the special admissions program was not the least intrusive
means of achieving those goals. Without passing on the state constitutional
or the federal statutory grounds cited in the trial court's judgement,
the California court held that the Equal Protection Clause required that
&quot;no applicant may be rejected because of his race, in favor of another
who is less qualified, as measured by standards applied without regard
to race.&quot;...</P>

<P>III. A. The parties disagree as to the level of judicial scrutiny to
be applied to the special admissions program. En route to this crucial
battle over the scope of judicial review, the parties fight a sharp preliminary
action over the proper characterization of the special admissions program.
Petitioner prefers to view it as establishing a &quot;goal&quot; of minority
representation in the medical school. Respondent, echoing the courts below,
labels it a racial quota. This semantic distinction is beside the point:
the special admissions program is undeniably a classification based on
race and ethnic background. To the extent that there existed a pool of
at least minimally qualified minority applicants to fill the 16 special
admissions seats white applicants could compete only for 84 seats in the
entering class, rather than the 100 open to minority applicants. Whether
this limitation is described as a quota or a goal, it is a line drawn on
the basis of race and ethnic status.</P>

<P>The guarantees of the 14th Amendment extend to all persons. Its language
is explicit. The guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when
applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of
another color. If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is
not equal. Nevertheless, petitioner argues that the court below erred in
applying strict scrutiny because white males are not a &quot;discrete and
insular minority&quot; requiring extraordinary protection from the majoritarian
political process. This rationale, however, has never been invoked in our
decisions as a prerequisite to subjecting racial or ethnic distinctions
to strict scrutiny. Nor has this Court held that discreteness and insularity
constitute necessary preconditions to holding that a particular classification
is invidious... Racial and ethnic classifications, however, are subject
to stringent examinations without regard to these additional characteristics.
We declared as much in the first cases explicitly to recognize racial distinctions
as suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination.</P>

<P>B...Over the past 30 years, this Court has embarked upon the crucial
mission of interpreting the Equal Protection Clause with the view of assuring
to all persons &quot;the protection of equal laws,&quot; in a Nation confronting
a legacy of slavery and racial discrimination. Because the landmark decisions
in this area arose in response to the continued exclusion of Negroes from
the mainstream of American society, they could be characterized as involving
discrimination by the &quot;majority&quot; white race against the Negro
minority. But they need not be read as depending upon that characterization
for their results. It suffices to say that &quot;over the years, this Court
consistently repudiated 'distinctions between citizens solely because of
their ancestry' as being 'odious to a free people whose institutions are
founded upon the doctrine of equality.'&quot; Petitioner urges us to adopt
for the first time a more restrictive view of the Equal Protection Clause
and hold that discrimination against members of the white &quot;majority&quot;
cannot be suspect if its purpose can be characterized as &quot;benign.&quot;
The clock of our liberties, however, cannot be turned back to 1868. It
is far too late to argue that the guarantee of equal protection to all
persons permits the recognition of special wards entitled to a degree of
protection greater than that accorded others. &quot;The 14th Amendment
is not directed solely against discrimination due to a 'two-class theory'
-- that is, based upon differences between 'white' and Negro.&quot;</P>

<P>Once the artificial line of a &quot;two-class theory&quot; of the 14th
Amendment is put aside, the difficulties entailed in varying the level
of judicial review according to a perceived &quot;preferred&quot; status
of a particular racial or ethnic minority are intractable. The concepts
of &quot;majority&quot; and &quot;minority&quot; necessarily reflect temporary
arrangements and political judgments. As observed above, the white &quot;majority&quot;
itself is composed of various minority groups, most of which can lay claim
to a history of prior discrimination at the hands of the State and private
individuals. Not all of these groups can receive preferential treatment
and corresponding judicial tolerance of distinctions drawn in terms of
race and nationality, for then the only &quot;majority&quot; left would
be a new minority of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. There is no principled
basis for deciding which groups would merit &quot;heightened judicial solicitude&quot;
and which would not. Courts would be asked to evaluate the extent of the
prejudice and consequent harm suffered by various minority groups. Those
whose societal injury is thought to exceed some arbitrary level of tolerability
then would be entitled to preferential classifications at the expense of
individuals belonging to other groups. Those classifications would be free
from exacting judicial scrutiny. As these preferences began to have their
desired effect, and the consequences of past discrimination were undone,
new judicial rankings would be necessary. The kind of variable sociological
and political analysis necessary to produce such rankings simply does not
lie within the judicial competence -- even if they otherwise were politically
feasible and socially desirable.</P>

<P>Moreover, there are serious problems of justice connected with the idea
of preference itself. First, it may not always be clear that a so-called
preference is in fact benign. Courts may be asked to validate burdens imposed
upon individual members of particular groups in order to advance the group's
general interest. Nothing in the Constitution supports the notion that
individuals may be asked to suffer otherwise impermissible burdens in order
to enhance the societal standing of their ethnic groups. Second, preferential
programs may only reinforce common stereotypes holding that certain groups
are unable to achieve success without special protection based on a factor
having no relationship to individual worth. Third, there is a measure of
inequity in forcing innocent persons in respondent's position to bear the
burdens of redressing grievances not of their making. By hitching the meaning
of the Equal Protection Clause to these transitory considerations, we would
be holding, as a constitutional principle, that judicial scrutiny of classifications
touching on racial and ethnic background may vary with the ebb and flow
of political forces. Disparate constitutional tolerance of such classifications
well may serve to exacerbate racial and ethnic antagonism rather than alleviate
them. Also, the mutability of a constitutional principle, based upon shifting
political and social judgments, undermines the chances for consistent application
of the Constitution from one generation to the next, a critical feature
of its coherent interpretation...</P>

<P>If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection against
classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background because such
distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather than the individual only
because of his membership in a particular group, then constitutional standards
may be applied consistently. Political judgments regarding the necessity
for the particular classification may be weighed in the constitutional
balance, but the standard of justification will remain constant. This is
as it should be, since those political judgments are the product of rough
compromise struck by contending groups within the democratic process. When
they touch upon an individual's race or ethnic background, he is entitled
to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that
basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest...</P>

<P>IV. We have held that in &quot;order to justify the use of a suspect
classification, a State must show that its purpose or interest is both
constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification
is 'necessary to the accomplishment' of its purpose or the safeguarding
of its interest.&quot; The special admissions program purports to serve
the purposes of : (i) &quot;reducing the historic deficit of traditionally
disfavored minorities in medical schools and the medical profession;&quot;
(ii) countering the effects of societal discrimination; (iii) increasing
the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently undeserved;
and (iv) obtaining the educational benefits that flow from an ethnically
diverse student body. It is necessary to decide which, if any, of these
purposes is substantial enough to support the use of a suspect classification.</P>

<P>A. If petitioner's purpose is to assure within its student body some
specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or
ethnic origin, such a preferential purpose must be rejected not as insubstantial
but as facially invalid. Preferring members of any one group for no reason
other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake. This
the Constitution forbids.</P>

<P>B. The State certainly has a legitimate and substantial interest in
ameliorating, or eliminating where feasible, the disabling effects of identified
discrimination. The school desegregation cases attest to the importance
of this state goal, which is far more focused than the remedying of the
effects of &quot;societal discrimination,&quot; an amorphous concept of
injury that may be ageless in its reach into the past. We have never approved
a classification that aids persons perceived as members of relatively victimized
groups at the expense of other innocent individuals in the absence of judicial,
legislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or statutory
violations... Without such findings of constitutional or statutory violations,
it cannot be said that the government has any greater interest in helping
one individual than in refraining from harming another. Thus, the government
has no compelling justification for inflicting such harm.</P>

<P>Petitioner does not purport to have made, and is in no position to make,
such findings. Its broad mission is education, not the formulation of any
legislative policy or the adjudication of particular claims of illegality...</P>

<P>C. Petitioner identifies, as another purpose of its program, improving
the delivery of health care services to communities currently underserved.
It may be assumed that in some situations a State's interest in facilitating
the health care of its citizens is sufficiently compelling to support the
use of suspect classification. But there is virtually no evidence in the
record indicating that petitioner's special admissions program is either
needed or geared to promote that goal. Petitioner simply has not carried
its burden of demonstrating that it must prefer members of particular ethnic
groups over all other individuals in order to promote better health care
delivery to deprived citizens. Indeed, petitioner has not shown that its
preferential classification is likely to have any significant effect on
the problem.</P>

<P>D. The fourth goal asserted by petitioner is the attainment of a diverse
student body. This clearly is a constitutionally permissible goal for an
institution of higher education. Academic freedom, though not a specifically
enumerated constitutional right, long has been viewed as a special concern
of the First Amendment. The freedom of a university to make its own judgments
as to education includes the selection of its student body. Thus, in arguing
that its university must be accorded the right to select those students
who will contribute the most to the &quot;robust exchange of ideas,&quot;
petitioner invokes a countervailing constitutional interest, that of the
First Amendment. In this light, petitioner must be viewed as seeking to
achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its
mission. It may be argued that there is greater force to these views at
the undergraduate level than in a medical school where the training is
centered primarily on professional competency. But even at the graduate
level, our tradition and experience lend support to the view that the contribution
of diversity is substantial. Physicians serve a heterogeneous population.
An otherwise qualified medical student with a particular background --
whether it be ethnic, geographic, culturally advantaged or disadvantaged
-- may bring to a professional school of medicine experiences, outlooks
and ideas that enrich the training of its student body and better equip
its graduates to render with understanding their vital service to humanity.</P>

<P>Ethnic diversity, however, is only one element in a range of factors
a university properly may consider in attaining the goal of a heterogeneous
student body. Although a university must have a wide discretion in making
the sensitive judgements as to who should be admitted, constitutional limitations
protecting individual rights may not be disregarded. Respondent urges --
and the courts below have held -- that petitioner's dual admissions program
is a racial classification that impermissibly infringes his right under
the 14th Amendment. As the interest of diversity is compelling in the context
of a university's admissions program, the question remains whether the
program's racial classification is necessary to promote this interest.</P>

<P>V. A. It may be assumed that the reservation of a specified number of
seats in each class for individuals from the preferred ethnic groups would
contribute to the attainment of considerable ethnic diversity in the student
body. But petitioner's argument that this is the only effective means of
serving the interest of diversity is seriously flawed...</P>

<P>The experience of other university admissions programs, which take race
into account in achieving the educational diversity valued by the First
Amendment, demonstrates that the assignment of a fixed number of places
to a minority group is not a necessary means toward that end... In such
an admissions program, race or ethnic background may be deemed a &quot;plus&quot;
in a particular applicant's file, yet it does not insulate the individual
from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats. The
file of a particular black applicant may be examined for his potential
contribution to diversity without the factor of race being decisive when
compared, for example, with that of an applicant identified as an Italian-American
if the latter is thought to exhibit qualities more likely to promote beneficial
educational pluralism. Such qualities could include exceptional personal
talents, unique work or service experience, leadership potential, maturity,
demonstrated compassion, a history of overcoming disadvantage, ability
to communicate with the poor, or other qualifications deemed important.
In short, an admissions program operated in this way is flexible enough
to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular
qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing
for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight.
Indeed, the weight attributed to a particular quality may vary from year
to year depending upon the &quot;mix&quot; both of the student body and
the applicants for the incoming class.</P>

<P>B. In summary, it is evident that the Davis special admissions program
involves the use of an explicit racial classification never before countenanced
by the Court. It tells applicants who are not Negro, Asian, or &quot;Chicano&quot;
that they are totally excluded from a specific percentage of the seats
in an entering class. No matter how strong their qualifications, quantitative
and extracurricular, including their own potential for contribution to
educational diversity, they are never afforded the chance to compete with
applicants from the preferred groups for the special admissions seats.
At the same time, the preferred applicants have the opportunity to compete
for every seat in the class. The fatal flaw in petitioner's program is
its disregard of individual rights as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.
Such rights are not absolute. But when a State's distribution of benefits
or imposition of burdens hinges on the color of a person's skin or ancestry,
that individual is entitled to a demonstration that the challenged classification
is necessary to promote a substantial state interest. Petitioner has failed
to carry this burden. For this reason, that portion of the California court's
judgment holding petitioner's special admissions program invalid under
the 14th Amendment must be affirmed.</P>

<P>C. In enjoining petitioner from ever considering the race of any applicant,
however, the courts below failed to recognize that the State has a substantial
interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions
program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.
For this reason, so much of the California court's judgment as enjoins
petitioner from any consideration of the race of any applicant must be
reversed.</P>

<P>VI. With respect to respondent's entitlement to an injunction directing
his admission to the Medical School, petitioner has conceded that it could
not carry its burden of proving that, but for the existence of its unlawful
special admissions program, respondent still would not have been admitted.
Hence, respondent is entitled to the injunction, and that portion of the
judgment must be affirmed.</P>

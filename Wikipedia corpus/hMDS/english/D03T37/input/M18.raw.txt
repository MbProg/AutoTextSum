Regents of the University of California v. Bakke

Conclusion Supreme Court Decision: 5 votes for Bakke, 4 votes against Citations Impact Regents of the University of the California v. Bakke Bakke Regents of the University of California Background on the Case Allan Bakke:
A thirty-five-year-old white man, applied twice for admission into the University of California Medical School at Davis. He was rejected both times. The school reserved sixteen places in each entering class of one hundred for "qualified" minorities, as part of the university's affirmative action program.

Bakke's qualifications (college GPA and test scores) exceeded those of any of the minority students admitted in the two years Bakke's applications were rejected. Original Ruling The Superior Court of Yolo County, California found that the special admissions program was illegal.
The Court declared that race could not be taken into account when making admissions decisions. However the Court also ruled that Bakke should not be admitted to the medical school.

The University of California appealed the case to the Supreme Court of California, which also declared the special admissions policy unconstitutional. Furthermore, the Supreme Court of California determined that Bakke should be admitted to the school.

The Regents of the University of California then appealed the case to the Supreme Court of the United States. Finoh, McAllister, & Barton, LLP The remaining four justices held that the use of race in admissions decisions in higher education was constitutionally permissible. Powell joined the dissenting opinion as well, believing that the use of race was permissible in decisions. Four of the justices believed that any racial quota system supported by government violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., agreed, casting the deciding vote ordering the medical school to admit Bakke.
However, in his concurring opinion, Powell argued that the use of racial quotas at the school violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the Supreme Court decided Bakke, California banned the state's use of race as a factor to consider in public schools' admission policies.

The Supreme Court has affirmed Chief Powell's opinion, rejecting racial "quotas", but allowing race to be one "factor" in college admissions to meet the interest of diversity.

Web. 7 Dec. 2012. <http://www.streetlaw.org/en/landmark/cases/regents_of_the_u_of_california_v_bakke>. Our Opinion We would have ruled in favor of Regents of the University of California. Bakke had been accepted to several other medical schools, but he took issue with UC Davis when someone told him Davis used quotas for affirmative action.
Affirmative action cannot be ruled unconstitutional until there is equality of opportunity.

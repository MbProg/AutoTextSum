Regents of the University of California v. Bakke
Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, case decided in 1978 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Court held in a closely divided decision that race could be one of the factors considered in choosing a diverse student body in university admissions decisions.
The Court also held, however, that the use of quotas in such affirmative action programs was not permissible; thus the Univ. of California, Davis, medical school had, by maintaining a 16% minority quota, discriminated against Allan Bakke, 1940â€“, a white applicant.
The legal implications of the decision were clouded by the Court's division.
Bakke had twice been rejected by the medical school, even though he had a higher grade point average than a number of minority candidates who were admitted.
As a result of the decision, Bakke was admitted to the medical school and graduated in 1982.

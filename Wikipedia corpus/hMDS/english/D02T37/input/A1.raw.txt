In this context, I would say that each and every are both possible, but each stresses the individuals more, in other words "every man" is closer to "all the men", "the whole crew".
But there are differences. Each usually requires that there is a known (limited) set of entities (in this case people). So in the examples you gave "each man" probably refers to the crew(s) of the ship(s), whereas Churchill's every man could mean either the men being addressed (where it could be replaced by each) or all men in a much wider context  (all Englishmen for instance).

Further differences:
Because each stresses separateness and every stresses totality, you can write "almost every", but not "almost each".
Every is not normally used for two entities (where it is normally replaced by both).

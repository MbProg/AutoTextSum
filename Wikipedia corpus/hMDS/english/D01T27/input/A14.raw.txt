Concentric Castles and Crusader Castles
 
A concentric castle is a castle with two or more concentric curtain                walls, where the outer wall is lower than the inner and can be defended                from it.
Concentric castles resemble one enclosure castle nested inside                the other, generally without a central free-standing keep. Where                the castle includes a particularly strong tower (donjon), such as                at Krak or Margat, it projects from the inner enceinte providing                a sort of citadel - a castle within a castle within a castle.
The word concentric does not imply that these castles were circular                in plan. The layout was rectangular where the terrain permitted                (Belvoir, Beaumaris), or an irregular polygon where curtain walls                of a spur castle followed the contours of a hill (Krak, Margat).
The relationship of the concentric castle to other forms of fortification                is complex. The Roman and Byzantine castrum may be regarded a precursor,                as its design also emphasised defence of the curtain wall and corner                towers, as opposed to a keep as favoured by the Normans.
In German-speaking countries, many castles had double curtain walls                with a narrow ward between them, called a Zwinger (English lists,                French lices). These double walls were usually added at                vulnerable points like the gate, but rarely as fully developed as                the in concentric castles.
The concentric design may well have originated in the Crusader                states. The earliest example of a concentric castle is the crusader                castle of Belvoir (c 1168), whose regular rectangular layout has                been described as one castrum nested inside another. Some historians                have plausibly argued that the concentric defence arose as a response                to advances in siege technology in the crusader states from the                12th to the 13th centuries.
In a concentric castle the outer wall protected the inner one from                siege engines, while the inner wall and the projecting towers provided                flanking fire from crossbows. In addition, the strong towers served                as platforms for trebuchets for shooting back at the besiegers.
Walls typically include intramural towers, arrow slits, and wall-head                defences such as crenellations or machicolations all aimed at an                active style of defence. In addition, the gate and posterns are                typically strengthened using a bent entrance with flanking towers.                Krak des Chevaliers in Syria is the best preserved of the concentric                crusader castles.
While a concentric castle has double walls and towers on all sides,                the defences are not necessarily uniform in all directions. There                can be a concentration of defences at a vulnerable point. At Krak                Des Chevaliers, this is the case at the southern side, where the                terrain permits an attacker to deploy siege engines.
Concentric castles were expensive to build, so that only the powerful                military orders, the Hospitallers and Templars, or kings such as                Edward I, could afford to build and maintain them.
The concentric layout particularly suited the requirements of military                orders such as the Hospitallers in resembling a monastery and housing                a large garrison of brothers. Such castles were beyond the means                of feudal barons. Consequently, concentric castles coexisted with                more modest enclosure castles and tower keeps even in the crusader                states.
Concentric castles appeared in Europe in the 13th century, with                the castles built in Wales by Edward I providing some outstanding                examples, in particular Beaumaris Castle, although Beaumaris remains                unfinished. As Beaumaris was built on flat terrain, it was necessary                to build walls and towers facing in all directions, giving a very regular, almost square, floor plan to the castle. Some influence                from crusader fortification has been conjectured.
The principle of an outer and inner wall was also used in fortified                cities, such as the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople and the city                wall of Carcassonne. The concept of mutually reinforcing lines of                defence with flanking fire was continued in later periods, such                as the early modern fortifications of de Vauban, where outer defence                works were protected and overlooked by others and their capture                did not destroy the integrity of the inner citadel.
 
English Device Forts
 
In 1534 the Act of Supremacy passed by the Parliament of England                made Henry VIII the head of the English church, challenging the                authority of the papacy. When Pope Paul III negotiated a peace in                1538 between the Holy Roman Emperor (Charles), and the King of France                (Francis I). The new peace represented a threat to England, In response                Henry undertook a programme of fort-building along England's south                coast.
In the first phase of Henrys fortification programme, 30                castles and forts were built. A curvilinear form of fortification                was developed which consisted of squat artillery towers surrounded                by round bastions to provide platforms for artillery. Good examples                of these are Walmer Castle and Deal Castle in Kent, Calshot Castle                and Hurst Castle in Hampshire and St Mawes Castle in Cornwall.
A new programme was begun after renewed threat from the French                in the 1540s. This concentrated on the vulnerable area around the                Solent estuary and the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth. This                programme of coastal defences reflected new developments in fortifications,                notably in the introduction of Italianate angular features. Earlier                curvilinear designs of castles were now replaced by square keeps                surrounded by angular or arrow-head shaped bastions. Good examples                of these are Yarmouth Castle and Southsea Castle built around 1545.                These represented a transitionary form between Henry's round forts                and so-called " Star                Forts ".

History of Famous Castles
Modern history of Europe was defined with both constant warfare and numerous fashion changes that were carried on by royalty and nobility, and during all     that time, castles stood as a proud guardians of history.
Proliferation of castle construction started spreading across entire Europe in 9th century, and     ever since then advances in technology, stonework, long range weapons and fashion fueled more than 7 centuries of the golden age of castle history.
Early history of castles began in some 6000 years ago when ancient Egyptians, Chinese and Middle Eastern civilizations started organized fortification of     their smaller settlements, and occasional hill fort built to be used in defensive capability.
Durability and usefulness of those early castles was very     rudimentary, but because of the lack of powerful siege weapons, even simpler wooden forts managed to provide significant defense against invading military     forces.
This situation changed with the rise of Roman Empire, which started utilizing very effective siege engines that even had ability to attack stone     hill forts.
Tremendous expansion of castle use in Europe happened after the fall of Carolingian Empire in 9th and 10th century.
With Europe being divided between     countless larger and smaller lords, Royalty and Church which was viewed as a savior of history, arts and architecture during the darkest times of European     Dark and Middle Ages.
With castles starting to be made all across the Europe, most were reinforced wooden homes, with motes and other natural defensive     structures that protected them (flattened hills, cliffs).
However, with increase of wars across entire Europe and the organized expansion of Normans beyond     Scandinavia in 11th century, castles started being made from stone.
That period of time was specifically notable for the rise of famous English castles     such as Windsor Castle , Tower of London , Warick and Alnwick castles, all which remained standing to today, providing stability and military support during     times of war and governmental and historical centers during time of peace.
After Norman expansion, the next large scale confrontation in Europe happened during crusades when European warriors encountered architectural advances     from Middle East.
These advances introduced significant changes to the stonework of European castles (spearheaded by the most advances castles of that time     created by the Military Orders of Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Teutonic Knights), ushering a several centuries of magnificent castle     construction that was remembered fondly in 19th and 20th century in the popular wave of romanticized mediaeval architecture, most notably in Victorian     times.
Armored with heavy defenses, multiple walls, towers, impressive castles began the pride of Germany, France and England.
As 17th and 18th century arrived, relative stabilization of Europe and the advent of gunpowder weapons forced decline in the construction of defensive     castles.
However, they continued being made but delegated to other forms â€“ royal or high-class residences and summer/winter houses.
This large switch     enabled creation of many famous castles that were highly fashionable, with even old 11-14th century castles receiving heavy retrofitting with each new     generation of owners.
By late 18th and entire 19th century, Europe became enhanced in the nostalgia about Renaissance and medieval times, which was cause for the creation of     very elaborate and fashionable castles that are today regarded as some of the best castles ever made.
One of the most famous ones is without the doubt     German castle Neuschwanstein that was built by Ludwig II of Bavaria in 1892.
This castle today represents the base of all modern pop-culture castles set in     the medieval times.
History of castles is long and interesting, and their heritage still continues to enrich our modern culture.

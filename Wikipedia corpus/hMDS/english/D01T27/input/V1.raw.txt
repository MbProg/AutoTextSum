Origin
Late Old English: from Anglo-Norman French and Old Northern French castel, from Latin castellum, diminutive of castrum 'fort'.
More
Castle goes back to Latin castellum, ‘little fort’ from castrum ‘fort’. To build castles in the air is to have daydreams or unrealistic fantasies. It comes from a Latin phrase used by St Augustine, who became bishop of Hippo in North Africa in ad 396. Another version, originally a translation from medieval French, is to build castles in Spain. This country was probably chosen because it was a distant place where it would have been extremely unrealistic to build—most of it was under the rule of the Moors at the time the phrase was first used in French.

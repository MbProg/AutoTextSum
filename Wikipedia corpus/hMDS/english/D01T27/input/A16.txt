Medieval European Castles/Wonders?
Are there any to suggest for me to look at?
I am currently trying to design a European city and Castle and draw it out, but the best I can do right now is draw a sand castle, so are there any good ones out there that you don't mind sharing?
Time period is during the Middle Ages, and also it can be anywhere in Europe, from the east to the west!

It is an excellent example of a medieval castle, as well as being superbly preserved.
It could give you some ideas about how to draw the town you're doin'.

Oh Sweet!
That's cool!
Also, just a quick question, I'm no expert in European history but are castles what Kings lived in?
Or, did Kings live in other places?
If so, are they like palaces???
There is a well preserved medieval castle on the island of Bornholm in Denmark.

Royal castles, as far as I know, were fortified just like any other one, but they generally were much more luxurious than something along the lines of the Welsh castle that I showed you, which was a purely military installation.
Castle-building really changed in the 15th century, when artillery became powerful enough to break down castle walls.
With the obsolescence of military-oriented castles, you see a change to indefensible palace-castles like Neuschwanstein in Germany.

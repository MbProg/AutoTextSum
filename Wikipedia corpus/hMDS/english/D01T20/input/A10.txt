South       Parks Road
Jackson Wing of       the Radcliffe Science Library, 1901 by Sir Thomas G. Jackson.
Six bays       and a slight projection with giant pilasters, a pediment, and a large       upper Venetian window.
The long range has buttresses and mullioned and       transomed windows bound together with arches at the very top.
Rhodes House was established by the will of Cecil Rhodes as a       centre for at any one time 96 scholars from the United States, 60 from the       British Empire, and 15 from Germany ( Rhodes       Scholars ).
In 1929 Sir       Herbert Baker designed the present building ... Squared rubble in small       blocks with ashlar dressings in more or less the same colour.
It had no       Oxford tradition.
... Rhodes House has a very odd 'parti' of a large       Cotswold mansion of the late C17, with mullioned and transomed windows,       balustrade and hipped roof, and set between its two front wings a small       classical rotunda with portico.
... The building is an oddity, but it has       personality enough to rouse affection in some.

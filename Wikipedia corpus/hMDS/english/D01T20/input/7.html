The particular intention was to satisfy a need for dedicated, learned clergy to promote the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Elizabethan_Religious_Settlement/" title="The Elizabethan Religious Settlement was a response to the religious divisions created in England over the reigns of Henry ...">Elizabethan Religious Settlement</a> in the parishes of England, Ireland and Wales. The college has since broadened the range of subjects offered, beginning with the inclusion of medicine and law, and now offers almost the full range of subjects taught at the university.

<p>Price continued to be closely involved with the college after its foundation. On the strength of a promised legacy, worth £60 a year on his death (approximately £ in present day terms), he requested and received the authority to appoint the new college's principal, fellows and scholars. He financed early building work in the college's front <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Quadrangle_(architecture)/" title="Quadrangle is a space or courtyard, usually rectangular in plan, the sides of which are entirely or mainly occupied by ...">quadrangle</a>, but on his death in 1574 it transpired that the college received only a <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/lump_sum/" title="A lump sum is a single payment of money, as opposed to a series of payments made over time.">lump sum</a> of around £600 (approximately £ in present day terms). Problems with his bequest meant that it was not received in full for about 25 years. As the college had no other donors at this time, "for many years the college had buildings but no revenue".<sup><a href="#Ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>The main benefactor, other than the King, was <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Eubule_Thelwall_(politician)/">Eubule Thelwall</a>, from <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Ruthin/" title="Ruthin is the county town of Denbighshire in north Wales.">Ruthin</a>, North Wales, who became Principal in 1621; he succeeded in securing a <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/List_of_founding_Fellows%2c_Scholars_and_Commissioners_of_Jesus_College%2c_Oxford/">new charter and statutes</a> for the college from <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/James_I_of_England/" title="James VI and I was King of Scotland as James&amp;nbsp;VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James&amp;nbsp;I from ...">James I</a>, having spent £5,000 of his own money on the hall and chapel, which earned him the title of its second founder.<sup><a href="#Ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Thelwall died on 8 October 1630, aged 68 and was buried in Jesus College Chapel where a monument was erected to his memory by his brother Sir Bevis Thelwall (Page of the King's Bedchamber and Clerk of the Great Wardrobe).</p>

On his death, in 1685, he bequeathed a large complex of estates, acquired largely by lawyer friends from the over-mortgaged landowners of the Restoration period. These estates allowed the college's sixteen fellowships and scholarships to be filled for the first time&nbsp;– officially, sixteen of each had been supported since 1622, but the college's income was too small to keep all occupied simultaneously.<sup><a href="#Ref-13">[13]</a></sup> In 1713, the bequest of Welsh clergyman and former student <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Edmund_Meyrick/">Edmund Meyrick</a>e established a number of scholarships for students from north Wales.<sup><a href="#Ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<h3>18th and 19th centuries </h3>
<p>The 18th century, in contrast to the disruption of the 17th century, was a comparatively quiet time for the college. A historian of the college, <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/J._N._L._Baker/">J. N. L. Baker</a>, wrote that the college records for this time "tell of little but routine entries and departures of fellows and scholars".<sup><a href="#Ref-14">[14]</a></sup> The <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Napoleonic_wars/" title="The Napoleonic Wars was defeated in 1814, and then once more in 1815 at Waterloo after a brief return to power.">Napoleonic wars</a> saw a reduction in the numbers of students and entries in the records for the purchase of <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/musket/" title="A musket is a muzzle -loaded, smoothbore firearm, fired from the shoulder.">musket</a>s and other items for college members serving in the university corps. After the war, numbers rose, to an average of twenty new students per year between 1821 and 1830. However, debts owed to the college had increased, perhaps due to the economic effects of the war&nbsp;– by 1832, the college was owed £986 10s 5d (approximately £ in present day terms).<sup><a href="#Ref-14">[14]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-15">[15]</a></sup> During the first half of the 19th century, the academic strength of the college diminished: scholarships were sometimes not awarded because of a lack of suitable candidates, and numbers fell: there were only seven new entrants in 1842.<sup><a href="#Ref-15">[15]</a></sup> <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Ernest_George_Hardy/">Ernest Hardy</a> wrote in his history of the college in 1899 that it had been becoming "increasingly evident for years... that the exclusive connection with Wales was ruining the college as a place of education."<sup><a href="#Ref-16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>A <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Royal_Commission/" title="A Royal Commission is a major ad-hoc formal public inquiry into a defined issue in some monarchies.">Royal Commission</a> was appointed in 1852 to investigate the university. The college wished to retain its links with Wales, and initial reforms were limited despite the wishes of the commissioners: those scholarships that were limited to particular parts of Wales were opened to the whole of Wales, and half of the fellowships awarded were to remain open only to Welshmen if and so long as the Principal and Fellows shall deem it expedient for the interests of education in connection with the Principality of Wales.<sup><a href="#Ref-15">[15]</a></sup> All the scholarships at the college, except for two, and all the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/exhibition_(scholarship)/" title="An exhibition is a type of scholarship award or bursary.">exhibitions</a> were still restricted to students from Wales.<sup><a href="#Ref-17">[17]</a></sup> The numbers of students at the college still fell, despite prizes being awarded for success in university examinations. <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Daniel_Harper_(headmaster)/">Daniel Harper</a>, principal from 1877 to 1895, noted the continuing academic decline. Speaking in 1879, he noted that fewer students from the college were reaching high standards in examinations, and that more Welsh students were choosing to study at other Oxford colleges in preference to Jesus. A further Royal Commission was appointed. This led to further changes at the college: in 1882, the fellowships reserved to Welshmen were made open to all, and only half (instead of all) of the 24 scholarships were to be reserved for Welsh candidates.<sup><a href="#Ref-18">[18]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-19">[19]</a></sup> Thereafter, numbers gradually rose and the non-Welsh element at the college increased, so that by 1914 only about half of the students were Welsh.<sup><a href="#Ref-18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<h3>20th century </h3>
<p>During the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/First_World_War/" title="World War I was a global war centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918.">First World War</a>, "the college in the ordinary sense almost ceased to exist".<sup><a href="#Ref-18">[18]</a></sup> From 129 students in the summer of 1914, numbers dropped to 36 in the spring of 1916. Some refugee students from Belgium and Serbia lodged in empty rooms in the college during 1916, and officers of the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Royal_Flying_Corps/" title="The Royal Flying Corps was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War, until it merged with the ...">Royal Flying Corps</a> resided from August 1916 to December 1918. After the war, numbers rose and fellowships were added in new subjects: history (1919 and 1933); theology (1927); physics (1934); a second fellowship in chemistry (1924); and modern languages (lectureship 1921, fellowship 1944). The improved teaching led to greater success in university examinations and prizes.<sup><a href="#Ref-20">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the inter-war years (1918–39) Jesus was seen by some as a small college and something of a backwater; it attracted relatively few pupils from the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Independent_school_(UK)/">public schools</a> traditionally seen as the most prestigious.<sup><a href="#Ref-21">[21]</a></sup> The college did, however, attract many academically able entrants from the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Grammar_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom/" title="A grammar school is one of several different types of school in the history of education in the United Kingdom and other ...">grammar schools</a> (particularly those in <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/northern_England/" title="Northern England is a cultural region of England.">northern England</a> and Scotland). Among these grammar-school boys was <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Harold_Wilson/" title="Harold Wilson was a British Labour Party politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1970 ...">Harold Wilson</a>, who would later become <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom/" title="The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of Her Majesty&#39;s Government in the United Kingdom.">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>.<sup><a href="#Ref-22">[22]</a></sup> During the Second World War, many of the fellows served in the armed forces or carried out war work in Oxford. The college remained full of students, though, as it provided lodgings for students from other colleges whose buildings had been requisitioned, and also housed officers on military courses.<sup><a href="#Ref-23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The college had its own science laboratories from 1907 to 1947, which were overseen (for all but the last three years) by the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/physical_chemistry/" title="Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of ...">physical chemist</a> <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/David_Chapman_(scientist)/">David Chapman</a>, a fellow of the college from 1907 to 1944. At the time of their closure, they were the last college-based science laboratories at the university.<sup><a href="#Ref-24">[24]</a></sup> They were named the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Leoline_Jenkins/">Sir Leoline Jenkins</a> laboratories, after a former principal of the college. The laboratories led to scientific research and tuition (particularly in chemistry) becoming an important part of the college's academic life.<sup><a href="#Ref-25">[25]</a></sup> The brochure produced for the opening ceremony noted that the number of science students at the college had increased rapidly in recent years, and that provision of college laboratories would assist the tuition of undergraduates, as well as attracting to Jesus College graduates of the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/University_of_Wales/" title="The University of Wales was a confederal university based in Cardiff, Wales, UK.">University of Wales</a> who wished to continue their research at Oxford. A link between one of the college science lecturers and <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Imperial_Chemical_Industries/" title="Imperial Chemical Industries was a British chemical company and was, for much of its history, the largest manufacturer in ...">Imperial Chemical Industries</a> (ICI) led to 17 students joining ICI between the two World Wars, some, such as <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/John_Rose_(chemist)/">John Rose</a>, reaching senior levels in the company. The laboratories became unnecessary when the university began to provide centralised facilities for students; they were closed in 1947.<sup><a href="#Ref-25">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>The quatercentenary of the college, in 1971, saw the opening of the Old Members' Buildings in the third quadrangle. Further student accommodation has been built at the sports ground and at a site in north Oxford. In 1974, Jesus was among the first group of five men's colleges to admit women as members, the others being <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Brasenose_College%2c_Oxford/">Brasenose</a>, <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Wadham_College%2c_Oxford/">Wadham</a>, <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Hertford_College%2c_Oxford/">Hertford</a> and <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/St_Catherine%27s_College%2c_Oxford/">St Catherine's</a>;<sup><a href="#Ref-26">[26]</a></sup> between one-third and one-half of the undergraduates are women. A long-standing rivalry with nearby <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Exeter_College%2c_Oxford/">Exeter College</a> reached a peak in 1979, with seven police vehicles and three fire engines involved in dealing with trouble in Turl Street.<sup><a href="#Ref-27">[27]</a></sup> <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/John_Habakkuk/" title="John Habakkuk was a British economic historian.">Sir John Habakkuk</a> (principal 1967–84) and <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Peter_North_(academic)/">Sir Peter North</a> (principal 1984–2005) both served terms as Vice-Chancellor of the university, from 1973 to 1977 and from 1993 to 1997 respectively.<sup><a href="#Ref-28">[28]</a></sup></p>

The foundation charter gave to the college a site between Market Street and Ship Street (which is still occupied by the college) as well as the buildings of a defunct university academic hall on the site, called White Hall.<sup><a href="#Ref-29">[29]</a></sup> The buildings that now surround the first quadrangle were erected in stages between 1571 and the 1620s; the principal's lodgings were the last to be built. Progress was slow because the new college lacked the "generous endowments" that earlier colleges enjoyed.<sup><a href="#Ref-30">[30]</a></sup> Before new buildings were completed, the students lived in the old buildings of White Hall.<sup><a href="#Ref-31">[31]</a></sup></p>
<h3>First quadrangle </h3>
<p>The chapel was dedicated on 28 May 1621, and extended in 1636.<sup><a href="#Ref-32">[32]</a></sup> The architectural historian <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Giles_Worsley/">Giles Worsley</a> has described the chapel's east window (added in 1636) as an instance of <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Gothic_Revival/">Gothic Revival</a> architecture, rather than Gothic Survival, since a choice was made to use an outdated style&nbsp;– <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/classical_architecture/" title="Classical architecture is more or less consciously derived from the principles of Greek and Roman architecture of classical ...">classical architecture</a> had become accepted as "the only style in which it was respectable to build".<sup><a href="#Ref-33">[33]</a></sup> <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Jonathan_Edwards_(academic)/">Jonathan Edwards</a> (principal from 1686 to 1712) is reported to have spent £1,000 (approximately £ in present day terms) during his lifetime on the interior of the chapel, including the addition of a screen separating the main part of the chapel from the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/ante-chapel/">ante-chapel</a> (at the west end) in 1693.

On 21 October 1864, <i>Building News</i> reported that the restoration was nearing completion and was of "a very spirited character". It said that the new "handsome" arch showed the east window "to great advantage", with "other improvements" including a "handsome reredos".<sup><a href="#Ref-34">[34]</a></sup> <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Ernest_George_Hardy/">Ernest Hardy</a>, principal from 1921 to 1925, said that the work was "ill-considered", described the reredos as "somewhat tawdry" and said that the Jacobean woodwork had been sold off too cheaply.<sup><a href="#Ref-36">[36]</a></sup> In contrast, the architectural historian <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Nikolaus_Pevsner/" title="The Nikolaus Pevsner was born in Leipzig, Saxony.">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> called the reredos "heavily gorgeous".<sup><a href="#Ref-37">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>The principal of the college resides in the lodgings, a Grade I listed building,<sup><a href="#Ref-38">[38]</a></sup> on the north side of the first quadrangle between the chapel (to the east) and the hall (to the west). They were the last part of the first quadrangle to be built.<sup><a href="#Ref-39">[39]</a></sup> Sir Eubule Thelwall, principal from 1621 to 1630, built the lodgings at his own expense, to include (in the words of the antiquarian <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Anthony_Wood/" title="Anthony Wood was an English antiquary.">Anthony Wood</a>) "a very fair dining-room adorned with wainscot curiously engraven".<sup><a href="#Ref-40">[40]</a></sup> The <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/hood_mould/">shell-hood</a> over the doorway (which Pevsner called "beautiful")<sup><a href="#Ref-37">[37]</a></sup> was added at some point between 1670 and 1740; Pevsner dates it to about 1700.<sup><a href="#Ref-36">[36]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-37">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>The hall has been said to be "among the most impressive of all the Oxford college halls", with its "fine panelling, austere ceiling, and its notable paintings".<sup><a href="#Ref-41">[41]</a></sup> Like the chapel, it was largely built by Griffith Powell between 1613 and 1620, and was finally completed soon after his death in 1620.<sup><a href="#Ref-39">[39]</a></sup> Pevsner noted the "elaborately decorated columns" of the screen (installed in 1634) and the dragons along the frieze, and said that it was one of the earliest examples in Oxford of panelling using four "L" shapes around a centre.<sup><a href="#Ref-32">[32]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-42">[42]</a></sup> In 1741 and 1742, the oak-beamed roof was covered with plaster to make rooms in the roof space.<sup><a href="#Ref-43">[43]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-44">[44]</a></sup> Pevsner described the 1741 <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Cartouche_(design)/">cartouche</a> on the north wall, which contains the college crest, as "large [and] rich".

<p>In 1640, Francis Mansell (appointed principal in 1630) began construction of a second quadrangle with buildings along the north and south sides; further work was interrupted by the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/English_Civil_War/" title="The English Civil War was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists in ...">English Civil War</a>.<sup><a href="#Ref-47">[47]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-48">[48]</a></sup> Work began again in 1676, and the library (now the Fellows' Library) was completed by 1679.<sup><a href="#Ref-49">[49]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-50">[50]</a></sup> Under Jonathan Edwards (principal from 1688 to 1712), further rooms were built to complete the quadrangle; the project was completed just after his death in 1712.<sup><a href="#Ref-49">[49]</a></sup> Pevsner described the second quadrangle as "a uniform composition", noting the "regular fenestration by windows with round-arched lights, their hood-moulds forming a continuous frieze".<sup><a href="#Ref-51">[51]</a></sup> The <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Dutch_gables/" title="A Dutch gable is a gable whose sides have a shape made up of one or more curves and has a pediment at the top.">Dutch gables</a> have <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/ogee/" title="An ogee is a curve, shaped somewhat like an S, consisting of two arc s that curve in opposite senses, so that the ends are ...">ogee</a> sides and semi-circular <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/pediments/" title="A pediment is an element in classical, neoclassical and baroque architecture, and derivatives therefrom, consisting of a ...">pediments</a>.<sup><a href="#Ref-51">[51]</a></sup> The writer <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Simon_Jenkins/">Simon Jenkins</a> said that the quadrangle has "the familiar Oxford Tudor windows and decorative Dutch gables, crowding the skyline like Welsh dragons' teeth and lightened by exuberant flower boxes".<sup><a href="#Ref-52">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Fellows' Library contains bookcases decorated with <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/strapwork/" title="Strapwork is a stylised representation in ornament of leather straps, consisting of flattened strips or bands of curling ...">strapwork</a> dating from about 1628, which were used in an earlier library in the college.<sup><a href="#Ref-51">[51]</a></sup> Hardy's opinion was that, "if only it had an open timber roof instead of the plain ceiling, it would be one of the most picturesque College Libraries".<sup><a href="#Ref-36">[36]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-53">[53]</a></sup> Another author said (in 1914, after the provision of a library for undergraduates elsewhere in the quadrangle) that it was "one of the most charming of Oxford libraries, and one of the least frequented".<sup><a href="#Ref-54">[54]</a></sup> It holds 11,000 antiquarian printed books and houses many of the college's rare texts, including a Greek bible dating from 1545 and signed by <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Philipp_Melanchthon/">Philipp Melanchthon</a> and others, much of the library of the scholar and philosopher <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Edward_Herbert%2c_1st_Baron_Herbert_of_Cherbury/" title="Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury was an Anglo-Welsh soldier, diplomat, historian, poet and religious ...">Lord Herbert of Cherbury</a> and 17th-century volumes by <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Robert_Boyle/" title="Robert Boyle was an Anglo-Irish natural philosopher, chemist, physicist and inventor born in Lismore, County Waterford, ...">Robert Boyle</a> and <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Sir_Isaac_Newton/" title="Isaac Newton was an English physicist and mathematician who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists ...">Sir Isaac Newton</a>.<sup><a href="#Ref-55">[55]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-56">[56]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Third quadrangle </h3>
<p>The long but narrow third quadrangle adjoins Ship Street, on the north of the site and to the west of the garden of the principal's lodgings, where the college has owned some land since its foundation. In the 18th century, this was home to the college stables. A fire in 1904 led to the demolition of the stables and the gateway to Ship Street.<sup><a href="#Ref-57">[57]</a></sup> Replacement buildings adjoining Ship Street, effectively creating a third quadrangle for the college, were constructed between 1906 and 1908.<sup><a href="#Ref-58">[58]</a></sup> It contained the college's science laboratories (now closed) and a new gate-tower, as well as further living accommodation and a library for students, known as the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Edmund_Meyrick/">Meyricke</a> Library, after a major donor&nbsp;– there had been an undergraduate library in the second quadrangle since 1865, known as the Meyricke Library from 1882 onwards.<sup><a href="#Ref-57">[57]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-58">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Old Members' Building, which contains a music room, 24 study-bedrooms and some lecture rooms, was built between 1969 and 1971.<sup><a href="#Ref-51">[51]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-59">[59]</a></sup> It was built after a fundraising appeal to Old Members to mark the college's quatercentenary, and was opened by the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Charles%2c_Prince_of_Wales/" title="Charles, Prince of Wales is the eldest child and heir apparent of Queen Elizabeth II.">Prince of Wales</a> in 1971.<sup><a href="#Ref-60">[60]</a></sup> The Fellows' Garden is between the Old Members' Building and the rear of the rooms on the west side of the second quadrangle. In 2002, a two-year project to rebuild the property above the college-owned shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Junior_Common_Room/">Junior Common Room</a> (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students.<sup><a href="#Ref-61">[61]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Other buildings </h3>
<p>The college purchased 10acres of land in east Oxford (near the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Cowley_Road%2c_Oxford/">Cowley Road</a>) in 1903 for use as a sports ground. Residential accommodation was first built at the sports ground in 1967 (Thelwall House, rebuilt in 1998), with additions between 1988 and 1990 (Hugh Price House and Leoline Jenkins House). A further development, known as Hazel Court (after <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Alfred_Hazel/">Alfred Hazel</a>, principal 1925–1944), was built in 2000, bringing the total number of students who can be housed at the sports ground to 135.<sup><a href="#Ref-62">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>Donations from <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Edwin_Stevens/" title="Edwin Stevens was a Welsh inventor who designed the world&#39;s first wearable electronic hearing aid.">Edwin Stevens</a>, an Old Member of the college, enabled the construction in 1974 of student flats at a site in north Oxford on the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Woodstock_Road_(Oxford)/">Woodstock Road</a>, named "Stevens Close" in his honour.<sup><a href="#Ref-63">[63]</a></sup> The college also owns a number of houses on Ship Street, which are used for student accommodation.<sup><a href="#Ref-64">[64]</a></sup> It has purchased a further site in Ship Street at a cost of £1.8M, which will be converted at a projected cost of £5.5M to provide 31&nbsp;student rooms with en-suite facilities, a 100-seat lecture theatre and other teaching rooms.<sup><a href="#Ref-65">[65]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-66">[66]</a></sup> The Ship Street Centre was officially opened by the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Lord_Patten_of_Barnes/">Lord Patten of Barnes</a>, on 25 September 2010.<sup><a href="#Ref-67">[67]</a></sup></p>

Despite the links with Wales that Hugh Price and many of the founding Fellows had, neither the 1571 charter nor any of the later charters limited entry to the college to Welshmen.<sup><a href="#Ref-136">[136]</a></sup> Nevertheless, the college students were predominantly Welsh from the outset,<sup><a href="#Ref-137">[137]</a></sup> and the college became "the pinnacle of the academic ambition of the young men of Wales".<sup><a href="#Ref-138">[138]</a></sup> Many of the fellows in the past were Welsh, since when new fellowships were created by benefactions (often by people of Welsh descent) there was frequently a stipulation that the recipients would be related to the donor or come from a specified part of Wales. These specific limitations were removed as part of reforms of Oxford University during the 19th century. Between 1571 and 1915, only one Principal (<a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Francis_Howell/">Francis Howell</a>, 1657–1660) was not from Wales or of Welsh descent.<sup><a href="#Ref-136">[136]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jesus still has a particular association with Wales and is often referred to as "the Welsh college". The college is home to the university's <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Jesus_Professor_of_Celtic/">Professor of Celtic</a>, and a specialist <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Celtic_languages/" title="The Celtic languages was first used to describe this language group by Edward Lhuyd in 1707.">Celtic</a> library in addition to the college's normal library. Meyrick scholarships, from the bequest of <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Edmund_Meyrick/">Edmund Meyrick</a> in 1713, are awarded for academic merit where the student is a native of Wales (or the child of a native of Wales), able to speak <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Welsh_language/">Welsh</a> or was educated for the last three years of secondary school in Wales.<sup><a href="#Ref-139">[139]</a></sup></p>
<p>The college's undergraduate gossip sheet is entitled <i>The Sheepshagger</i> in allusion to an offensive joke about Welsh people's supposed <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Zoophilia/" title="Zoophilia is a paraphilia involving a sexual fixation on animals.">penchant for sheep</a>. Furthermore, the Welshness of the College is self-perpetuating, as Welsh students will often apply to Jesus because it is seen as the Welsh college. Old members recall the college having a majority of Welsh members until well into the 20th century;<sup><a href="#Ref-140">[140]</a></sup> today, however, around 15% of undergraduates come from Wales.<sup><a href="#Ref-141">[141]</a></sup> For comparison, residents of Wales comprise just under 5% of the United Kingdom population (2.9&nbsp;million<sup><a href="#Ref-142">[142]</a></sup> out of a total of 58.8&nbsp;million<sup><a href="#Ref-143">[143]</a></sup> at the time of the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/United_Kingdom_Census_2001/">2001 Census</a>).</p>
<p>In modern times, the Welsh roots of the college come to the fore most prominently on <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Saint_David%27s_Day/" title="Saint David&#39;s Day is the feast day of Saint David, the patron saint of Wales, and falls on 1 March each year.">Saint David's Day</a>.

<h2>Coat of arms</h2>
<p>The college's <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/coat_of_arms/" title="A coat of arms is a unique heraldic design on an escutcheon, surcoat, or tabard.">coat of arms</a>, in <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/heraldry/" title="Heraldry is the profession, study, or art of creating, granting, and blazon ing arms and ruling on questions of rank or ...">heraldic</a> terminology, is <i>Vert, three stags trippant argent attired or</i>.<sup><a href="#Ref-148">[148]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-149">[149]</a></sup> The arms are not those of Hugh Price.<sup><a href="#Ref-150">[150]</a></sup> His arms, according to their depiction in the margins of his will, were <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/gules/">gules</a> (red) a chevron ermine between three <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/fleur-de-lis/" title="The fleur-de-lis is a stylized lily or iris that is used as a decorative design or symbol.">fleurs-des-lis</a>.<sup><a href="#Ref-151">[151]</a></sup> The arms were not granted or authorised by the <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/College_of_Arms/" title="The College of Arms is a royal corporation consisting of professional officers of arms, with jurisdiction over England, ...">College of Arms</a>, but the length of time for which they have been used has given them a prescriptive authority.<sup><a href="#Ref-151">[151]</a></sup></p>
<p>The earliest depiction of the arms was thought to be about 1590, in a document held by the College of Arms, which refers to the stags appearing on a blue (in heraldic terms, <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Azure_(heraldry)/" title="Azure is the tincture with the colour blue, and belongs to the class of tinctures called &quot;colours&quot;.">azure</a>) background but subsequent examination of this document by Peter Donoghue, Bluemantle Pursuivant shows that the arms were added c.1680 . The first known appearance of the arms is therefore on John Speed’s Map of Oxfordshire in 1605 with a blue field. The green field made its appearance by 1619 in an armorial quarry painted by one of the Van Linge brothers.<sup><a href="#Ref-152">[152]</a></sup> The green background became generally (but not universally) used by the 1730s, still appearing as horizontal hatchings indicating azure were in use on bookplates for the college library as late as 1761.<sup><a href="#Ref-153">[153]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are similarities with the arms of <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Lincoln_College%2c_Oxford/">Lincoln College, Oxford</a>, where one of the elements consists of three golden stags statant (standing still); this was derived from the coat of arms of Lincoln's so-called "second founder", <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Thomas_Rotherham/" title="Thomas Rotherham was an English cleric and statesman.">Thomas Rotherham</a>.<sup><a href="#Ref-149">[149]</a></sup> It was once claimed that Jesus had stolen the stags from Lincoln,<sup><a href="#Ref-154">[154]</a></sup> but the counter-argument (from an antiquarian with close Lincoln connections) was that the origins of each were distinct.<sup><a href="#Ref-155">[155]</a></sup> One suggestion (by <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Paul_Langford/">Paul Langford</a>, the Rector of Lincoln College) is that Jesus College continued the arms adopted by a theological college founded by Rotherham in his home town&nbsp;– Jesus College, <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Rotherham/" title="Rotherham is a large town in South Yorkshire, England, which together with its conurbation and outlying settlements to the ...">Rotherham</a>&nbsp;– which had been suppressed in the time of <a href="/web/20160410164222/http://everything.explained.today/Edward_VI_of_England/">Edward VI</a>.<sup><a href="#Ref-149">[149]</a></sup></p>

One writer has suggested that the college may have adopted the arms in order to be associated with one of the leading Welsh families of the day.<sup><a href="#Ref-151">[151]</a></sup></p>
<p>This latter theory is not heraldically tenable as the quarters in an achievement after the first and pronominal quarter brought into the family by marriage to heraldic heiresses cannot meaningfully exist on their own to represent the person who now quarters them. It is more probable then that the arms of the College really are those of Archbishop Rotherham and were assumed to be those of the College by John Speed who saw them on one of its buildings in 1605 when preparing his map. Lawrence Hall in Ship Street was given to Rotherham in 1476 and leased to Jesus in 1572. It may well have displayed the Archbishop’s arms in its structure as did the building on the south side of the front quad of Lincoln which he completed. These arms for Jesus College could not be confused with those of Lincoln as that College, since 1574, already had a complex tripartite coat granted to it by Richard Lee, Portcullis Pursuivant, in which the colour of the stags in the centre section had been changed to Or (gold) and their attitude to statant.<sup><a href="#Ref-157">[157]</a></sup></p>

Le Bal Des Ardents Le Mal Des Ardents Label: FRACTAL
Genre: Experimental     Format: LP | Catalog n. Fractal 878 | Year.
(2016)
Le Bal Des Ardents is a mini-LP reissue of a strange cassette based on the terrifying historical event about the French King Charles VI the day of January 28th 1393, where he escaped from a fire caused by a torch during a masked ball, a tragedy who will let him sink into madness soon after.
The main theme of this record try obviously to recall Charles VI hallucinations, torments and his craziness reflected through the magic of the tarot card and with also probably the help of psychotropic.
This complete unknown 80s industrial group and “stillnotongoogle” released this obscure document on tape in 1987 titled "Le Mal Des Ardents" in private, just for friends.
Musically?
Le Bal Des Ardents’s statement for the reissue analyses the whole thing: “At first, The Residents and their album “Not Available” recorded in 1974 but released intentionally four years after!
We took the same concept but here with a gap of twenty nine years which brings us to this reissue’s key point, to the “Space/Time” notion, inspired from the two titles tracks of the “Seven Up” album of Ash Ra Tempel with Timothy Leary, and the last point, more direct: we were influenced, at that time, by the music of Einstürzende Neubauten, Throbbing Gristle, Zoviet France and especially SPK”.
Otherwise, the approach of this works can be compare in a certain way to the compilation album “Necropolis, Amphibians & Reptiles: the music of Adolf Wölfli” which presents evident similarities and which was released around the same time.
Enigmatic, vivid and dark, Le Bal Des Ardents will be an ideal companion album to the bands listed above, deeply industrial 80’s old school with harsh electronic sound.
All fans of the genre will be delighted!
Limited numbered edition on clear vinyl (comes with an insert).

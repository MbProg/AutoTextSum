Masquerade balls were a feature of the Carnival season in the 15th century, and involved increasingly celebrate allegorical Royal Entries, pageants and triumphal processions celebrating marriages and other dynastic events of late medieval court life.
The "Bal des Ardents" ("Burning Men's Ball") was held by Charles VI of France, and intended as a Bal des sauvages ("Wild Men's Ball"), a form of costumed ball (morisco).
It took place in celebration of the marriage of a lady-in-waiting of Charles VI of France's queen in Paris on January 28, 1393.
The King and five courtiers dressed as wildmen of the woods (woodwoses), with costumes of flax and pitch.
When they came too close to a torch, the dancers caught fire.
(This episode may have influenced Edgar Allan Poe's short story "Hop-Frog".)
Such costumed dances were a special luxury of the ducal court of Burgundy.
Masquerade balls were extended into costumed public festivities in Italy during the 16th century Renaissance (Italian, maschera).
They were generally elaborate dances held for members of the upper classes, and were particularly popular in Venice.
They have been associated with the tradition of the Venetian Carnival.
With the fall of the Venetian Republic at the end of the 18th century, the use and tradition of masks gradually began to decline, until they disappeared altogether.

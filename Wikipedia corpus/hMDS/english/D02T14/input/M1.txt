What was the 'Ball of the Burning Men'?
In an unlikely sequence of events, what began as a joyful royal celebration in medieval France ended in a tragedy that claimed the lives of four people
On 28 January 1393, a masquerade ball was held at the French royal court to celebrate the marriage of one of the Queenâ€™s ladies-in-waiting.
The young King Charles VI and five of his noble companions performed a dance as â€˜wild menâ€™, disguised in masks and shaggy costumes made from linen and resin.
Late, and somewhat intoxicated, the Duke of Orleans arrived carrying a lit torch, being unaware of the strict prohibitions on bringing naked flames into the hall.
One account describes how he then â€˜threwâ€™ the torch at the dancers, but others suggest he simply came too close to them while trying to guess their identities.
Whatever the case, the dancersâ€™ highly flammable costumes soon became engulfed in flames.
The King, standing a little apart, was saved when his teenage aunt threw her skirts over him to put out the fire.
Another dancer leapt into a vat of wine.
The other four performers were less fortunate, being â€œburned aliveâ€¦ releasing a stream of bloodâ€.
The tragedy shook public confidence in the monarchy - destroying the reputation of the Duke of Orleans, in particular - and became known as the â€˜Bal des Ardentsâ€™, or the â€˜Ball of the Burning Menâ€™.

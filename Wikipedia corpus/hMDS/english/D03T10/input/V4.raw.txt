Description:
Written by John F. Kennedy as senator from Massachusetts on United States Senate stationary, Washington, D.C. Dated: Monday, March 22, 1954To: Mr. Neil LeonardBingham, Dana & Gould1 Federal StreetBoston, MassachusettsDear Mr. Leonard: Thank you for writing to me concerning my vote on the Bricker Amendment. My position on this resolution was reached only after considerable study and deliberation and a statement was prepared setting forth my reasons for opposing this resolution as well as the George Amendment. In the event that this statement has not come to your attention, I am enclosing a copy for your information. With every good wish, I am, Sincerely yours, John F. KennedyEnclosureJFK: wjdCondition: Very clean and clear, typed in bright blue ink, with 2 horizontal folds not affecting any of the text. The enclosure is not present, but there are tiny staple holes at the top left-hand corner just above "John F. Kennedy." The Bricker Amendment is the collective name of a number of proposed amendments to the United States Constitution considered by the United States Senate in the 1950s. Each of these amendments would have placed restrictions on the scope and ratification of treaties and executive agreements entered into by the United States and are named for their sponsor, Senator John W. Bricker of Ohio, a conservative Republican.The best-known version of the Bricker Amendment, considered by the Senate in 1953–54, declared that no treaty could be made by the United States that conflicted with the Constitution, was self-executing without the passage of separate enabling legislation through Congress, or which granted Congress legislative powers beyond those specified in the Constitution. It also limited the president's power to enter into executive agreements with foreign powers.Bricker's proposal attracted broad bipartisan support and was a focal point of intra-party conflict between the administration of president Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Old Right faction of conservative Republican senators. Despite the initial support, the Bricker Amendment was blocked through the intervention of President Eisenhower and failed in the Senate by a single vote in 1954. Three years later the Supreme Court of the United States explicitly ruled in Reid v. Covert that the Bill of Rights cannot be abrogated by agreements with foreign powers. Nevertheless, Senator Bricker's ideas still have supporters, and new versions of his amendment have been reintroduced in Congress periodically. (Wikipedia). Bookseller Inventory # 308

    <meta name="description" xml:lang="en" lang="en" content="This paper will examine the crusade that a group of conservative women, the Vigilant Women for the Bricker Amendment (VWBA), active in the Republican Party and conservative women’s clubs, carried out to pressure politicians and sway public opinion in favor of the so-called “Bricker Amendment,” devised to limit the treaty-making powers of the President in the 1950s. The VWBA, born out of the efforts of influential anticommunist conservative organizations, successfully promoted anti-statist and anti-internationalist ideas at the local level: in their neighborhood, in women’s clubs, at church or in the local press. A case study of Vigilant Women reveals the prominent role these women played in the formation and activation of a large conservative grassroots network. I will examine the prevalence of the domestic ideology and populist rhetoric in the discourse of VWBA and their allies, and try to demonstrate how resurgent domesticity in the post-WWII period shaped these women’s activism as they engaged primarily in home-based political action." />

                  <p class="abstract" dir="ltr">This paper will examine the crusade that a group of conservative women, the Vigilant Women for the Bricker Amendment (VWBA), active in the Republican Party and conservative women’s clubs, carried out to pressure politicians and sway public opinion in favor of the so-called “Bricker Amendment,” devised to limit the treaty-making powers of the President in the 1950s. The VWBA, born out of the efforts of influential anticommunist conservative organizations, successfully promoted anti-statist and anti-internationalist ideas at the local level: in their neighborhood, in women’s clubs, at church or in the local press. A case study of Vigilant Women reveals the prominent role these women played in the formation and activation of a large conservative grassroots network. I will examine the prevalence of the domestic ideology and populist rhetoric in the discourse of VWBA and their allies, and try to demonstrate how resurgent domesticity in the post-WWII period shaped these women’s activism as they engaged primarily in home-based political action.</p>

Indeed, from 1945, the traditional anti-statist discourse was coupled with a strong anti-internationalist stance as the nascent United Nations became the primary target of the American Right for trying to establish a “world government.” In the early 1950s, so as to restore American sovereignty, a Republican senator from Ohio, John W. Bricker, supported by the most conservative fringe of the Republican Party, proposed an amendment aiming at limiting the President’s power to sign international treaties that might supersede the Constitution. Thousands of women, active in the Republican Party and conservative organizations, coordinated their efforts as the Vigilant Women for the Bricker Amendment (VWBA) in order to sway public opinion (which was much divided) and pressure their representatives. Notwithstanding the defeat of Senator Bricker’s proposal, the Vigilant Women</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">– among its most fervent defenders – successfully forwarded their anti-statist and anti-internationalist ideas at the grassroots level.</span></p>

This paper will first set to appraise the political culture and types of activism these postwar conservative women had inherited, before focusing on VWBA</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">itself: presenting its origins, the geographical location of the movement, the profile of its members and the activities they engaged in. This paper will finally consider the significance of the domestic ideology and populist rhetoric in the pro-Bricker Amendment movement’s literature and public discourse.</span></p>

Champions of classic liberalism, as proponents of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;  font-size:12.0pt;"><em>laissez-faire</em></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">, had objected to state intervention in economic affairs; partly as a result of women’s growing involvement in the conservative movement, state interventionism in another domain – the so-called private sphere – became of equally utmost importance.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn1" id="bodyftn1">i</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> During the first Red Scare (1919-1920) these right-wing women, mainly active in the northeast and High-Midwest, worried about the menaces communism seemingly posed to family as an institution – threats notably revealed by the Overman Committee</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn2" id="bodyftn2">ii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> (1918-19), which in investigating bolshevism, gave a prominent place to so-called private matters as the committeemen heard testimonies about the many ways Soviet Russia sought to destroy family by legalizing abortion, facilitating divorce procedures or encouraging “free love.” The sanctity of home had to be shielded from the influence of a Soviet-like intrusive government so that conservative women soon leveled criticism at Progressives, whose maternalist approach called for the development of a tight relation, not solely between mother and father, but between mothers and the welfare state at the risk of seeing family – in particular women and children – nationalized.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn3" id="bodyftn3">iii</a></p>

They engaged massively in the isolationist movement, building the far-right</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">mothers’ movement, fiercely opposed to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s foreign policy. These ultraconservative women differed from preceding generations of right-wing patriotic women as they unabashedly resorted to a rhetoric tinged with anti-Semitism. They also adopted a more confrontational style of activism: the far-right women learnt from “housewife activism,”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn4" id="bodyftn4">iv</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> the political action and style of the Depression-era working-class housewives who staged meat boycotts and anti-eviction protests, “introduc[ing] a populist outlook to female politics.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn5" id="bodyftn5">v</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Their appropriation of such “housewife populism” helped demonstrate that they too somehow formed a movement of ordinary and marginalized people, struggling against the elites, although most of the mothers’ movement’s leaders belonged to the middle and upper classes.</span></p>

As conservatives found themselves a new nemesis, the UN, right-wing women began contrasting the “world government” with the American mother figure. While, they asserted, American mothers raised their children in the love of God and cardinal principles of liberty and individualism, the UN – especially through UNESCO programs – strove to secularize education, promote miscegenation and homogenize the American youth so that they adhere to internationalist thought.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn6" id="bodyftn6">vi</a></p>

The American Bar Association (ABA), then presided by Frank E. Holman, strenuously opposed the Covenant on Human Rights proposed by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in 1948 and the Genocide Convention in 1949. Holman launched a campaign whose aim was to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">offer a protection against abuse of the treaty power. His writings influenced </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">John W. Bricker “who would become the political champion and namesake of Holman’s movement to amend the Constitution.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn18" id="bodyftn18">xviii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> In 1951, the Republican Senator from Ohio introduced a first resolution (S. Res. 177) against the Covenant of Human Rights, which he argued contained provisions that denied rights (e.g. freedom of speech in times of national emergency) otherwise guaranteed to all American citizens by the U.S. Constitution. As for the Genocide Convention, it established that hate crimes (against racial or religious groups) had to be brought before an international court. This particularly incensed conservative Republicans and southern Segregationists in the Democratic Party who feared the United Nations might intervene in American affairs by advocating federal civil rights legislation, thus curtailing states’ rights.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn19" id="bodyftn19">xix</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> The “Bricker Amendment” was therefore an act of rebellion against the aggrandized powers of the federal government and presidential function under Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Bricker resolution, not acted upon, was followed by the two first versions (S.J. Res 102 in 1951 and S.J. Res 130 in 1952) of what was to be henceforth known as “the Bricker Amendment.” In 1952, Bricker’s revised version of the amendment was co-sponsored by 58 Senators. The amendment caused controversy at first but considering the solid support the bill enjoyed within the Republican ranks in Congress (only one Republican Senator had refused to co-sponsor it), the Republican platform in the 1952 election quite unsurprisingly endorsed the measure: </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">“We shall see to it that no treaty or agreement with other countries deprives our citizens of the rights guaranteed them by the Federal Constitution.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn20" id="bodyftn20">xx</a></p>

Dwight D. Eisenhower saw the measure as an attempt to undermine presidential authority in foreign policy and found it redundant as it basically was “an addition to the Constitution that said you could not violate the Constitution.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn21" id="bodyftn21">xxi</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> The president sought a compromise with Bricker, quite unsuccessfully, and publicly expressed his opposition during a press conference on March 26 1953. While the bill was stalled in committee, Bricker led the fight </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">in the Senate</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> against another proposed treaty, the NATO</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Status of Forces treaty, in order to preserve the right of American soldiers abroad to be tried under American law, as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution:</span></p>

According to one of the founders, Ruth Murray, the amendment represented the best chance to unify conservatives, as she later told the Senate Judiciary Sub-Committee headed by Senator Estes Kefauver in May 1955: ‘It seemed to be the one banner around which all defenders of American sovereignty could rally.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn23" id="bodyftn23">xxiii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> They adopted the torch-bearing hand as a symbol for their own enlightenment and alertness and “the battle for the Bricker Amendment is On!” as a motto. The campaign was launched in Wisconsin and Illinois in September 1954 and “mushroomed into national proportions simply through the correspondence of women “alarmed at the danger” to domestic law represented by the treaty-making powers of the President.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn24" id="bodyftn24">xxiv</a></p>

It met with particular success in the Midwest, where the movement originated, and in California.

The group was officially open to all women: no mention about members’ race, ethnicity or class was made, but the “Brickerettes”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn26" id="bodyftn26">xxvi</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> were characteristically white Christian middle and upper-class women.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn27" id="bodyftn27">xxvii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> The group was composed of non-working women in majority and this was precisely in these terms that the two national coordinators liked to describe themselves: “We are just ordinary housewives.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn28" id="bodyftn28">xxviii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Most </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;  font-size:12.0pt;"><em>Vigilant Women</em></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> activists were middle-aged women who had raised their children, taking advantage of their free time and means to become more active in politics. To portray the members as “just ordinary housewives”, however, is to overlook some of the members’ political and professional achievements. Some of them were assuming great responsibilities (and in some cases, had been for years) within the GOP or women’s organizations, such as the hereditary society Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR). Others did not necessarily match the typical profile constructed by Murray because they were actually working, mostly in the professions: as teachers, writers, or doctors. Thus, the New York State coordinator, Lucille Cardin Crain, was a former teacher and had been editor of the</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;  font-size:12.0pt;"><em> Educational Reviewer</em></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> (1949-1953), funded by Catholic conservative William F. Buckley, Sr., in order to detect possible subversive and “collectivist” ideas in school books.  Dr. Nell K. McCue, the Oregon coordinator, was Director of the Capital Business College in Salem, Oregon; not what we would consider an “ordinary housewife.” Finally, a younger generation of conservative women in their early thirties, like Phyllis Schlafly or national coordinator Winifred Barker’s own daughter, Eugenia Joyce Houle, was also active while they raised their young children. The membership was therefore much more diverse than what Ruth Murray asserted. </span></p>

The group seemed to appeal to Protestant and Catholic women alike. All the Vigilant Women regarded themselves as crusading “patriots” fighting against the establishment of a communist “world government.” This commonly-used “patriot” label obscured the ideological heterogeneity of the membership: the leaders of the VWBA movement privately referred to themselves as “patriots,” “rebel women,” “conservatives” or “libertarians” but seldom addressed the differences that may have existed between them, although they undoubtedly represented different trends of conservatism.</p>

To ensure such success, the group solicited help from other organizations of women, veterans and farmers. In Milwaukee, Ruth Murray arranged a large meeting at the Medford Hotel where 22 state-wide organizations were convened; 14 answered the call, the majority of their delegates pledging to circulate petitions and hand out literature. Ruth Murray invited two pro-Bricker speakers – Representative Lawrence H. Smith (Racine) and Milwaukee attorney Carl B. Rex – to the Milwaukee meeting to explain the Bricker measure and the considerable dangers awaiting America if it were not to be adopted:  </p>

As recounted by Washington correspondent Drew Pearson, the Vigilant Women “swarmed over Capitol Hill corridors, buttonhol[ed] congressmen, beleaguer[ed] senators, and plant[ed] ‘news’ bulletins in automobiles.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn30" id="bodyftn30">xxx</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Some delegation also called on the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican National Committees; the visit to Secretary of State John Foster Dulles did not occur because, one Oklahoma Vigilant Woman joked, he happened to have “skipp[ed] town because he knew all these women were coming here.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn31" id="bodyftn31">xxxi</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> The delegation of women met Dwight Eisenhower for 45 minutes </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">on Friday, January 22</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:6.96pt; vertical-align:super;">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> but, according to Frank Holman, this meeting “was very unsatisfactory.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn32" id="bodyftn32">xxxii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">Despite the failure of this audience with the President, the 500 women or so coming from all over the country (36 states in total) to demonstrate their support for the Republican Senator’s proposal captured the attention of many.

At the local level, meetings were occasionally organized in the members’ homes but “virtually all of their business . . . [was] transacted by mail or telephone.” Letter-writing to editors and Congressmen remained their primary and most effective activity:</span></p>

The Vigilant Women rapidly intensified the campaign and distributed literature which revealed the Senators’ voting record, and named and shamed the organizations (such as the League of Women Voters, the Young Women’s Christian Association, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith) which had come out against the amendment. A good way for Vigilant Women to remind members of the political power they could have in the coming mid-term elections of November 1954. In the meantime, Bricker introduced yet another amendment (S.J. Res 1) in August 1954, to no avail. In 1955, in order to sustain their “program of education,” VWBA had to launch a fundraising campaign which allowed them to print 300,000 copies of “Why We Need the Bricker Amendment” and circulate other such articles, speeches and pamphlets regarding treaty law.</p>

The editorialist accused Bricker and his staff of “being less than helpful” to the movement while praising the indefatigability of the two Vigilant Women leaders. (S)he marveled at the fact that Murray and Barker would not betray their convictions by accepting a watered-down amendment as they had “in effect said, ‘Give us our principles, or give our organization death.’” The editorialist finally harbored doubt as to the passage of the Dirksen substitute since it did not have “the force of the Vigilant Women behind it.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn41" id="bodyftn41">xli</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> The Dirksen treaty amendment did fail to pass. By 1957, the two national coordinators were given the possibility to make a new statement regarding Bricker’s latest (and last) resolution (S.J. Res. 3). Ruth Murray wrote on behalf of Winifred Barker and herself that they did not wish to make further comment as their position on the Bricker Amendment remained as unchanged as ever; they would not back an inadequate bill but signaled their readiness to embark on their crusade again: </span></p>

When asked by a journalist from the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;  font-size:12.0pt;"><em>Reporter</em></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> how she tried to explain the amendment and mobilize people, Ruth Murray retorted: “Well, I tell them our homes and children are in danger.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn44" id="bodyftn44">xliv</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> The leaders of VWBA systematically connected their political involvement with their being housewives and mothers; in the media they recurrently described the group as “a voluntary organization of housewives and mothers of boys overseas.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn45" id="bodyftn45">xlv</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> In her May 1955 statement to the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt; color:#000000;">Senate Judiciary Sub-Committee, Ruth Murray</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> was to reiterate the crucial role her identity as a mother played in her political engagement:  “Being a mother of four children and a grandmother, I view with alarm any power to make motherhood and its attendant privileges – deciding how and when you’re going to nurse your own baby – appropriate subject for international agreements.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn46" id="bodyftn46">xlvi</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> UN intervention in the private domain could but infringe upon women’s (and more specifically mothers’) freedom.</span></p>

In early Cold War America, male and female politicians, Republicans and Democrats, were apt to redefine women’s role and extend their sphere of action but remained attached to a traditional vision of womanhood. Katie Louchheim, Director of Women’s Activities for the DNC from 1953 to 1960, stretched the elastic boundaries of the supposed “women’s sphere” to the world: “Today’s housewife is not only the guardian of her home. In the broader sense, she is the guardian of the future. For a woman’s home today is the world.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn47" id="bodyftn47">xlvii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Helen Laville considers this extension as a response to the development of nuclear weaponry. Women’s sphere of action became wider as the once-“untouchable domestic haven” came under attack of a nuclear war. Such a threat to home and family made civic and political involvement, including in the international field, a requirement for patriotic American women, all the more so if they were mothers.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn48" id="bodyftn48">xlviii</a></p>

Lucille Cardin Crain, for instance, hardly capitalized on gender at all when waging the campaign for the BA, although she was convinced that women’s “sixth sense” made them fitter for politics than men. She usually presented Vigilant Women and other women patriots as “rebel” and enlightened citizens rather than housewives and mothers.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn49" id="bodyftn49">xlix</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Despite Vigilant Women’s emphasis on education, their decriers questioned their claim to be well-informed and reproached the group for sponsoring propaganda literature (“Our Constitution Has a Dangerous Loophole”) which misquoted the Constitution, having “changed [its] wording” to deceive the readers into thinking that treaties can override the U.S. Constitution when in fact, Frederick W. La Croix wrote to the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;  font-size:12.0pt;"><em>Milwaukee Journal</em></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">, “it is only the state constitutions and laws that can be overridden by treaties or any federal laws.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn50" id="bodyftn50">l</a></p>

John Bricker emphasized the nobleness of Vigilant Women’s action:  they stood as “the heart and soul of patriotic America.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn51" id="bodyftn51">li</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">As for his assistant, Charles A. Webb, he evoked innate differences between men and women activists, extolling what he called “the feminine mind.” To Webb, women represented the ideal grassroots activists not only because they had more time on their hands (assuming that women were generally housewives) but also because they possessed a unique trait of character: they displayed greater perseverance than men for they tended to believe in the impossible. He cited the example of a Texas woman who wrote her Senator asking a copy of the 10,000 executive agreements which Secretary of State Dulles said had been made under NATO only. Reading this list of agreements did not seem such an insurmountable task to carry out for this Brickerite who claimed to “have both the time and the inclination to read them, since [she] d[id] not play either the piano or golf.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn52" id="bodyftn52">lii</a></p>

Associating the Brickerites with the suffragist movement served two major purposes. First of all, the Brickerites drew a parallel between suffragists, whose fight helped fulfill the original American constitutional promise of democracy and equality, and the Brickerettes’ struggle in favor of an amendment that would reaffirm the principle of national sovereignty and safeguard individual liberties. In other words, granting women suffrage and reviewing treaty law both came down to achieving what the Founders had intended, according to Holman: </span></p>

Frank Holman was fond of this comparison and called the rally in Washington, D.C. in January 1954 a “pilgrimage,” reminiscent of the heyday of women’s activism in the suffrage movement, and even advised Vigilant Women to organize parades as the suffragettes had done.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn55" id="bodyftn55">lv</a></p>

According to Ruth Murray’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Sub-Committee, the VWBA was born out of spontaneous grassroots outrage at the abuse of treaty power. In fact, a large network of conservative women’s groups mobilized their resources to form VWBA, as historian Allan J. Lichtman explained: “The DAR and Minute Women fired up their telephone networks to form the Vigilant Women for the Bricker Amendment.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn56" id="bodyftn56">lvi</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> VWBA was, to a certain extent, an extension of these two organizations – their temporary lobbying arm. The media thus noted that many women at the Washington rally in January 1954 wore a Minute Women badge. Several leaders of VWBA were known to be part of DAR too</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt; color:#c00000;">. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">One of Vigilant Women’s founders, Sara Roddis Jones, was even to become president of the patriotic organization in the mid-1970s.</span></p>

Minute Women’s founder and first president, Suzanne Stevenson, had actually encouraged a semi-secret policy which owed much to the members’ fear of being infiltrated, as recounted by Ellen McClay (pen name of conservative activist and author Gene Birkeland).</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn58" id="bodyftn58">lviii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Members were asked to “act only as individuals” as the newsletter made it clear: “The Minute Women never take action as a pressure group.” Indeed, Stevenson reckoned that their patriotic campaign would be more effective if members were perceived as aroused citizens embracing the cause individually and spontaneously.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn59" id="bodyftn59">lix</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Additionally, as Erin M. Kempner argued, “the feigned spontaneity and individual nature of Minute Women work also protected the group from censure, since the organization denied responsibility for any and all organized protest.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn60" id="bodyftn60">lx</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> VWBA undeniably acted more openly than MWUSA, although they manifestly pursued the same approach regarding spontaneity and individuality. </span></p>

Crain had started urging the necessity for the publication of a pamphlet on how “so many [women] have been used, largely through perfectly innocent organizations to which they belong, to promote. . . a plan of ‘international collectivism’.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn63" id="bodyftn63">lxiii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Insistence on the nonpartisanship and independence of VWBA helped provide a sharp contrast with the naivety of liberal ladies “swallowing whole” international plans and Truman’s policies.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn64" id="bodyftn64">lxiv</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">Finally, it might be that Ruth Murray attempted to distance the VWBA from Minute Women, which was quite controversial from its inception, due to the ambiguous relations some of the group’s leaders had cultivated with notorious anti-Semitic and white supremacist figures whose writings were publicized in their newsletter.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn65" id="bodyftn65">lxv</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Much to observers’ dismay, the group had regularly and quite unapologetically invited these “hate experts” as guest speakers at their meetings too.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn66" id="bodyftn66">lxvi</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> In a 1953 award-winning </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;  font-size:12.0pt;"><em>Houston Post </em></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">exposé, reporter Ralph O’Leary had attacked the Minute Women’s local Houston, TX, chapter for spreading “a miasmic fear of Communism” and declared it “the most powerful organization of its kind in Houston . . . since the death of the local Ku Klux Klan.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn67" id="bodyftn67">lxvii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> At any rate, if the VWBA’s public discourse did not highlight the relations with MWUSA, their literature addressed to Brickerites contained extensive references to it and DAR as the other leading patriotic women’s organizations endorsing the Bricker Amendment.</span></p>

Kefauver challenged Ruth Murray’s statement that Vigilant Women “acted as individuals” and pointed out that VWBA might have to register with Congress as a lobbying group under the requirements of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 as they were “operating for the purpose of trying to influence legislation.” To which Mrs. Murray responded: “We are not an organization.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn69" id="bodyftn69">lxix</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Historian Allan Lichtman contends that Vigilant Women represented a highly-organized grassroots movement; in some measure, some of its members (he takes young Illinois activist Phyllis Schlafly as an example) even proved to “out-organize” the pro-Bricker men.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn70" id="bodyftn70">lxx</a></p>

Alexander Wiley from Wisconsin – also suggested that the group was financed by “Texas oil money”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;">so that Ruth Murray had to certify to the Senate Judiciary Sub-Committee that the organization was financed mostly by small ($5) contributions and leaders’ own funds in order to preserve the anti-elitist character of their crusade, declaring whenever she could that Vigilant Women were “just people.”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn71" id="bodyftn71">lxxi</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Mrs. Sara Roddis Jones, from Wisconsin, directly answered Wiley’s attacks in the press: “We resent statements from Senator Wiley and others that we are a well-financed organization. We are financed only by our husbands!”</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn72" id="bodyftn72">lxxii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> Such assertions reinforced the notion that members were primarily housewives and depended on their husbands’ support (financial and other) whereas some VW state leaders were born into wealth and/or earned a living. What is more, Mrs. Henry Jones and her co-workers constantly repeated that printing pamphlets or making trips to the Capitol actually made them lose money, which contributed to presenting them as principled women willing to make sacrifices for a cause they were genuinely committed to.</span></p>

Knowing that many of the Vigilant Women coordinators were civic leaders or even served as presidents or vice-chairwomen of state Republican clubs, such undue emphasis on Vigilant Women’s lack of political skills clearly indicates their will to pass for a non-political movement. In that way, Murray seemed to agree with Holman who professed that the amendment was not a “political” issue since it received bipartisan support.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn73" id="bodyftn73">lxxiii</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"> As a matter of fact, Murray went a bit further as she envisioned the movement first and foremost as a crusade.</span><a class="endnotecall" href="#ftn74" id="bodyftn74">lxxiv</a></p>

Webb apparently overlooked the fact that most Vigilant Women were members of groups such as Minute Women, whose record on religious and racial tolerance was all too poor.</p>

Anticommunist and anti-internationalist Cold War women manifestly embraced but also helped challenge this ideology by taking interest in international relations and playing an active role in politics. By joining VWBA, they strove to safeguard the U.S. Constitution by supporting an amendment which would ensure that treaties and executive agreements could not supersede “the supreme law of the land” and strip Americans of their rights. Regardless of the redefinition of housewives’ societal role and place, VWBA still developed a discourse centered on motherhood and domesticity and mainly engaged in “kitchen table” activism (from research activities to letter-writing), making it their key mode of political action. The growth in home-centered activism appeared to signify reconciliation between the many (and at times, contradictory) roles Cold War society assigned to America women. </p>
                  <p class="texte" dir="ltr" style="margin-left:0.0cm; margin-right:0.0cm; text-indent:0.6cm; text-align:justify; font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"><span class="paranumber">41</span>The Vigilant Women, formed at the initiative of prominent women’s conservative organizations, efficaciously poured their human and technical resources into a large-scale grassroots movement. It was long though before historians started taking interest in right-wing women’s activism in the early Cold War years and acknowledging the influence of such behind-the-scenes activism conducted in women’s living rooms and kitchens. Admittedly, VWBA failed as neither the Bricker Amendment nor any of the substitute versions were adopted in Congress. Pro-Bricker women did manage, however, to disseminate anti-internationalist ideas in the media and to unify conservative women around a single issue which they deemed vital to the preservation of national sovereignty. Moreover, they successfully exploited the populist rhetoric deployed by right-wing women as soon as the 1930s while prudently cultivating a more polished and respectable image as militants.</p>
                  <p class="texte" dir="ltr" style="margin-left:0.0cm; margin-right:0.0cm; text-indent:0.6cm; text-align:justify; font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-size:12.0pt;"><span class="paranumber">42</span>The history of the fight for the Bricker Amendment points to the potential and limits of kitchen-table activism for these postwar conservative women. Unquestionably, they found it to be a quite effective and powerful type of activism, building up strong wide networks they could re-activate whenever necessary; the strength of these grassroots networks were too become manifest in the 1960s. Yet, their choice to perform traditional, more subservient, roles placed conservative women activists in a problematic position: by acting as researchers, educators, publicists or lobbyists only, and consequently remaining on the periphery of the political arena, the Vigilant Women deeply depended on the male leaders of the movement. While the pro-Bricker movement ran out of steam, conservative women’s conviction and motivation were still intact. To a certain extent, the outcome of the pro-Bricker Amendment struggle even heightened these women’s crusading zeal and created a certain distrust of the Republican political establishment for having accepted compromise and given up the fight too soon. </p>

Nancy Hendrick wrote this critical piece on Minute Women of the U.S. Inc. after its creation in Connecticut. She described a meeting attended by 400 women, including “a few Negro women” but no Jewish women as the author made the group’s anti-Semitism quite clear. VWBA was in part the offspring of Minute Women whose newsletter reminded their readers they “welcome[d] members of all races and all creeds who believe[d] in their principles and who wish[ed] to join their Crusade.” The two groups’ memberships overlapped in the early 1950s; yet, I have found no evidence so far that non-white women may have been members of VWBA.</p>

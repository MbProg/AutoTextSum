Truman,                            Treaties, and the Bricker Amendment
HISTORICAL                              REVISION OUTFLANKED
One                              of the noteworthy features of the very late 20th and very early 21st centuries is the way                              in which everything that was once an historical accusation                              has become a defense. Thus, if on the evidence, FDR                              had a really good idea where the Japanese fleet was                              and where it was going in early December 1941, this                              is no longer a charge to be made against him, but                              is instead evidence of his farsighted statesmanship.                              He had to get us into World War II, by any means necessary,                              for our own good; it follows that this history of                              deceit and indirection is "justified" by                              its good consequences.
If,                              on the evidence, the early Civil Rights Movement was                              riddled with card-carrying Stalinists, this no longer                              calls the broader ideology of that movement into question.                              A cynic might say that the massive inroads on private                              property and the bureaucratic empire raised up in                              the name of civil rights were consistent with the                              communists' overall goals, but to say that is, apparently,                              the same as being an apologist for slavery. Instead,                              Stalinist participation simply proves how advanced,                              humane, and loveable the commies were.
There are many other examples. Presidential wars, undertaken                              without the clear consent of Congress, make up another                              such case. Here, too, the argument has been turned                              around.
TRUMAN,                              KOREA, AND THE U.N. CHARTER
In                              the summer of 1950, and ever after, critics of President                              Truman's manner of committing US forces to combat                              in Korea have held that, whatever the merits of aiding                              to South Korea may have been, the way in which                              he acted was improper and probably "unconstitutional." The pertinent text, Article I, Sect. 8, of the US                              Constitution lodges power "to declare War, grant                              Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning                              Captures on Land and Water" with Congress. Defenders                              of presidential practice have had to fall back on                              a hundred or so so-called "precedents," which were in general very thin or irrelevant, or                              evidence of successful usurpations, which logically                              had no lasting authority.( 1 )
Certainly,                              Old Right figures like Senator Robert Taft (R., Ohio)                              never conceded the lawfulness of Truman's entry into                              the Korean War. As he wrote in 1951: ""My                              conclusion, therefore, is that in the case of Korea,                              where a war was already under way, we had no right                              to send troops to a nation, with whom we had no treaty,                              to defend it against attack by another nation, no                              matter how unprincipled that aggression might be,                              unless the whole matter was submitted to Congress                              and a declaration of war or some other direct authority                              obtained."( 2 ) Critics of US                              involvement in Indo-China made similar complaints,                              doubting aloud that the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution,                              obtained by President Johnson under false pretenses,                              constituted a declaration of war, or some sort of                              acceptable substitute for one.
For                              a season, there was talk of the "imperial presidency" and a reassertion of Congressional authority in foreign                              affairs.( 3 ) One result was the War                              Powers Act of 1973. The next several administrations                              spent their spare time finding ways around the Act.
NOW THEY TELL US
Now                              comes Professor Robert F. Turner to drive the last                              nails in the coffin of the Old Right argument. He                              has served as Associate Director of the Center for                              National Security Law at the University of Virginia                              and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.                              (One naturally wonders what "national security                              law" could possibly be.) His coffin-nailing activities                              took place in 1996 in the Harvard Journal of Law                              and Public Policy. This circumstance, too, is                              a bit unsettling, since that journal's acolytes display                              a marked overlap with the dreaded Federalist Society.
Can                              you say "Neo-Con," boys and girls?
But                              good may come out of Nazareth, after all, so let us                              attend to the argument. Deploring a "national                              mood of isolationism" in the 1920s and '30s which                              derailed Americans' understanding of these matters,( 4 )                              Turner holds that the (capital-F) Founders were worldly                              fellows who understood these things. Clearly,                              they meant the President to have an unfathomably deep                              well of inherent power with which to carry out his                              constitutional duties.
It is possible, I guess, that this is all true, but if                              so, quite a lot of lying and swindling must have gone                              on in the Constitutional Convention and the subsequent                              ratifying conventions in order quietly to lodge so                              much power in one man and still put the document over                              on people who had just fought a revolutionary war                              partly in the name of antimonarchism.
Turner                              is happier with the later "mood" of the                              people, who cured of their "isolationism," embraced Collective Security after World War II. This                              improved national mental health motivated the Senate                              to ratify the United Nations Treaty. Turner cites                              remarks of Senator Warren Austin (R., Vermont) as                              indicative of the new outlook: "a threat to international                              security and peace occurring anywhere on earth constituted                              a direct threat to the security and peace of                              the United States."
Further,                              under the treaty, "I have no doubt of the authority                              of the President in the past, and his authority in                              the future, to enforce peace…. [T]he President is                              the officer under our Constitution in whom there is                              exclusively vested the responsibility for maintenance                              of peace."( 5 )
Appealing                              to ratification of the UN Treaty and the UN Participation                              Act, Turner reasons that both houses of Congress believed "that the basic commitment to act collectively                              in response to armed international aggression had                              been made."( 6 ) Amendments put                              forward by "unrepentant isolationists" to                              restrict presidential power to lead Americans into                              the new international paradise were beaten back. The                              only problem with the UN's practical workings came                              with the onset of the Cold War. The Soviet Union began                              using its veto power in its own interests.
When                              North Korean forces invaded South Korea in late June                              1950, Truman immediately consulted with UN officials.
Here                              is how Congressman Howard Buffett (R., Nebraska) characterized                              these events: "On June 25, 1950, the U. N. Security                              Council demanded a cease-fire and called on members                              to render every assistance to the United Nations in                              the execution of this resolution. Nothing was said                              about entering the conflict…. But at 12 o'clock noon,                              on June 27, President Truman ordered United States                              air and sea units to give the Korean Government troops                              cover and support. That order put our military forces                              into the Korean civil war on the side of the South                              Koreans. At 10:45 that evening, 11 hours later, the                              Security Council requested members of the U. N. to                              supply the Republic of Korea with sufficient military                              assistance to repel invasion."
Thus,                              concluded Buffett, "Truman entered that war by                              his own act, and not because of a United Nations decision."( 7 )
Such                              minutiae do not detain Professor Turner. In his view,                              Truman acted properly through the UN. And contrary                              to what he calls the "myth of the imperial presidency," Truman consulted with key Congressional leaders, "who unanimously supported the President's actions…."( 8 )                              This seems a bit too easy.
One                              does not get around the question of whether or not                              a Congressional declaration of war was constitutionally                              required by saying the President was so kind as to "inform" and "consult" a handful                              of Congressional leaders, who – whatever their virtues                              – fell a bit short of being a majority. Turner has a couple of fallback positions. One seems to be that                              in ratifying the UN Treaty Congress knowingly gave                              away its power to declare war, entrusting it to                              the President's good judgment - in cooperation with                              the UN and in the name of securing "peace" by making war collectively.
I                              cannot get into the odd semantics of UN-speak here                              (but see my paper, " The                              United Nations Charter and the Delusion of Collective                              Security ").                              It is enough to say that redefining war-making as "peace-making," solely because a number                              of nations have formed a club to make war together                              in the name of peace, does not necessarily                              amend the Constitution of the United States with respect                              to Congressional authority to declare war. It might                              conceivably do so, but it does not seem obvious to                              the naked eye.
BRICKER'S                              PROBLEM
Professor                              Turner also deploys notions of inherent executive                              power entirely separate from the UN Charter. These                              vast powers, apparently, have existed from time out                              of mind, and the ratifiers knowingly signed on for                              them in 1787-1788. This, too, is not self-evident,                              but must wait for another time.
What                              is interesting, is that Professor Turner in putting                              so much stock in the UN Charter as a source of presidential                              power has highlighted precisely the problem that Senator                              John Bricker (R., Ohio) raised, and sought to correct                              with his much-abused Bricker Amendment. The problem                              is this: can the President and Senate in effect repeal                              or overturn fundamental provisions of the Constitution                              by colluding with foreign states? A related problem                              is whether or not a President, on his own motion,                              can make agreements with foreign states, agreements                              that will have, legally, the same effects as treaties.
It                              seems to me that Professor Turner may have inadvertently                              reopened the case of the Bricker Amendment; whether                              there is a case for the Amendment is a topic                              I shall take up at my next opportunity.
There                              is an interesting puzzle that I will mention now.                              If the President could go to war in Korea with the                              UN and because of the Charter, how does one justify                              legally the current war, where a President has acted                              neither with the UN nor with a declaration of war                              from Congress?
I                              know that some might say that the Resolution of 9/12/01                              answers every possible question and covers every possible                              contingency. If that is true, we have abandoned all                              pretense of the "rule of law," despite our                              touching, 200-year old cult of the Constitution. What                              a pity.

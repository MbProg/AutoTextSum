NoSleep is a place for authors to share their original horror stories.
For a more detailed explanation of the subreddit, click here.
Suspension of disbelief is key here.
Everything is true here, even if it's not.
Don't be the jerk in the movie theater hee-hawing because monkeys don't fly.
Still confused?
Check out the rules and guidelines or ask your questions in /r/NoSleepOOC !
Note: Please attempt to secure permission from the authors before posting, narrating, or sharing a story elsewhere.
Authors work very hard on their stories and credit should be given to them for their work.
Come chat in the NoSleep IRC!
Posting Rules:
Read the Posting Guidelines & Author FAQ, and make sure your story fits all the guidelines before posting.
Only post your original stories.
Plagiarism, posting creepypasta, or band-wagoning another writer’s story are against the rules.
Even if you are the original author of a story found elsewhere on the internet, the post runs the risk of removal if you cannot prove this to the moderators.
This is to protect the intellectual property of the writers.
Posts that are not stories belong in our discussion subreddit, r/nosleepOOC .
If it is not an actual story, it will be removed from r/nosleep .
Stories must be believable within reason.
A more detailed explanation can be found in the posting guidelines.
Do not comment out of character in your thread.
Example: saying “I wrote this for English class” in your post or in the comments would be “out of character,” as it takes away the reader’s ability to immerse themselves in your story.
Graphic content must be marked with a Trigger Warning (NSFW).
Do not include a TL;DR with your post, and do not summarize the plot in your title.
This is a subreddit for scary stories, not scary summaries.
Get creative, and find a way to define your story without giving it away.
Tags (example: [True], [real experience], /r/someothersubreddit ) are not allowed.
The only thing in brackets[]{} or parenthesis() should be a reference to which “part” of your series the post is.
Example: (part 1) [Pt2] On tagging other subreddits in your titles- this is misleading and has become an issue.
Rule-breaking tags will result in a post removal.
You may only post once every 24 hours.
This goes for one-post stories as well as series posts.
See the posting guidelines.
Comment Rules:
Readers are to act as though everything is true and treat it as such in the comments.
No debunking, disbelief, or criticism (constructive or otherwise).
If the formatting is off, report the post and mods will address it.
No “backseat modding.”
If something breaks a rule, report it- don’t go all vigilante and start correcting other users.
Do not ask for proof or tl;dr’s.
Be respectful to one another- this means no disrespectful, derogatory, or otherwise unkind comments towards or about one another.
This also means no hate speech- if you can’t be civil, you can’t comment.
Comments must contribute to the discussion.
This means no joke comments- “nope,” “all aboard the nopetrain,” “who was phone,” none of that.
It also means your comment should have or make a point.
Report all comments that violate these rules.
Read the Reader FAQ !
Any violation of these rules will be met with appropriate discipline.
Inappropriate posts and comments will be removed at moderator discretion.
Harassment of users, repeated rule violations, or reposting removed stories can and will result in a ban.

A Crazy Idea From an Admin... ( self.nosleep )
eingereicht
vor 3 Jahre
*
von hueypriest [ A ]
I awoke in the small hours the other night with a crazy idea, and I haven't really been able to sleep since.
What if, this Halloween reddit and /r/nosleep held a proper offline event.
We'd have it at some haunted location in the US (or maybe outside) and have all sorts of story telling, writing workshops, local haunt visits and other fun, creepy activities.
Thinking a few hundred people, but who knows.
What say you, /r/nosleep citizens?
Would you be interested?
Would you travel for such an event if sufficiently awesome?
Do you own, know of, conveniently have access to an appropriate haunted or creepy location.
What activities, panels, etc would you be interested in seeing at such an event?
Will you hold my hand when it get's really scary?
Edit - Update:
YAY!
Glad y'all are as excited about this as I/we are.
Couple thoughts after reading all the comments:
Amazing location suggestions.
We will consider all of them (even the ones outside the US).
Keep them coming!
Obviously, no matter where we would have this event it would be inconvenient for some of you.
We'll try to pick a location that is good for a lot of people.
If this goes well I'd think we'd do it in a different creepy location each year.
Even though this would be an offline event, I'm sure we would have a lot of things (storytelling, etc) that would be broadcast online and/or recorded so that everyone can enjoy even if you can't make it.
Halloween seems to be an obvious date choice, but not set in stone, especially if a lot of haunted places have established events there already.
Always check under the bed
EDIT 2 - This event will be called The NoSleepOver

I think the common problem I have seen while reading through these responses is that it will be hard for a lot of people to travel.
I wonder if there is a way to do smaller groups in different areas, then connect to the other groups, like a webcam deal on a better technological level.
Each group could have their own special guest speaker/author or maybe even a tour of the spooky spot they picked for their /r/nosleep meetup?
That would mean less funding for those having to travel, less problem finding a large enough venue, etc.
Each group could "register" their location and speaker/author or location beforehand so we can plan the timing really well.

The Bell Witch Cave in Northern Tennessee ( 50 minutes from Nashville ) on the KY/TN border is awesome.
Cheap camping nearby on the red river where the legend also takes place.
The Legend of the Bell Witch is a supposedly true story that the movie An American Haunting and the Blair Witch Project was loosely based upon .
It'd be a great place to scare the ever living shit out of ourselves without being completely frozen out during October/November.

As someone who lives in Northern California I can assure you this would be an awesome place!
Parking is a bit tight in Stinson but there are a lot of great little picnic spots.
One of the best beaches in NorCal!
There's a secret little spot there too, when we all get over there I've got something to you...

I wrote this a while back to explain why the Stinson Beach story is such a good example of blurring the lines between fact and fiction (and a fantastic story in general), and it seems... eerily appropriate as an argument for why we should meet there.
Even if reading it scares you half to death and you have to sleep with the lights on for a while, you can always reassure yourself with the certainty that the story's made up, the creation of a very imaginative redditor.
You know ghosts aren't real - you're a rational person and don't believe rubbish like that.
You look up Stinson Beach online and see it's just another Californian tourist magnet location, popular with couples on vacation.
It's ridiculous; there's no reason to be afraid of a scenic romantic getaway.
You could probably go there and be fine.
Maybe you will go there, just to prove it's perfectly safe.
You'll laugh it off and forget about it; Stinson's too far away for a fool's errand.
But you'll find yourself thinking about it from time to time, a lingering thought that you just can't shake.
It looks like a lovely vacation spot, doesn't it?
That's the only reason you find yourself looking at ticket prices to go out there.
It's only after you're almost to your hotel that you realize how curious you are about what's really going to be there.
Because you know, just like all of us knew, that there's something waiting for you at Stinson Beach.
Something very important, that we need to show you.

Depending on the location, I'm all for it.
If I had a passport and plane tickets, I'd say the catacombs under Paris would be ideal.
With a lack of both, an abandoned asylum would be best.
What if we had local /r/nosleep get-togethers, and possibly had someone tape the stories we tell?
That way, even if we can't all get to the same place, we can have a kind of montage of the best spoken stories from across the nation.

No idea, but possibilities of covering costs include some combination of: - Tickets for the event.
Lot of different ways to do it.
- Support from reddit (the company).
- Support from sponsors.

Could you please bring this event to the UK?
I know quite a few brilliant haunted locations in the UK, specifically Clifford Tower in York which is a medieval castle / fortress which is infamous for the mass suicide / homicide of hundreds of jews in the 12th century and is infamously said to be haunted by their spirits.

What about Athens, Ohio?
Home of Ohio University.
Nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains of Southeast Ohio, it has literally everything to be the perfect spot.
It's about 1.5 hours south of Columbus, 3 hours west of Pittsburgh, and 2.5 hours east of Cincinnati.
Hauntings:  Athens is routinely mentioned as one of the most haunted places in America and even the world:
http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-most-haunted-cities-in-the-u-s.php http://www.smashinglists.com/10-most-haunted-places-in-the-world/
The city and campus are pretty much one and the same, and make up a perfect college town.
Outside town there are five cemeteries, which when connected by lines create a pentagram with college green right in the middle.
One cemetery - Simms Cemetery - is said to be almost impossible to find because it "moves".
The old Athens Lunatic Asylum (also known as The Ridges) is the former state mental hospital.
There are all sorts of stories of hauntings in the buildings and on the grounds.
One story includes a patient who disappeared and got lost in the building.
She wasn't found in time and died.
When they found her, her body had left a STAIN on the concrete that is impossible to remove.
Every time it's cleaned, it comes back.
I'm pretty sure tours are given of the ridges during halloween.
Perhaps the best part of choosing Athens is that each year the town hosts one of the largest halloween parties in the country.
The main street is completely shut down while everyone comes out in full costume.
Ohio University was recently named the #1 party school in the nation, and Halloween lives up to that!
Having a reddit meetup, hauntings tour, and insane block party sounds like an awesome time!
Here is another website with a bunch more information.

I went there to visit a friend of mine once.
Heard a basketball bouncing above his dorm room all night.
We were on the top floor.

Yep, this is one of the most common hauntings in the dorms.
It can be very distracting when going to someone's dorm for "activities" in the middle of the night and hearing marbles dropping and rolling to a corner on the ceiling above you.

This sounds great!
Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to travel much for it since Halloween is in the middle of the week this year.
I'll suggest the St Augustine lighthouse, partially because it's close to me and partially because it's pretty awesomely creepy.
It is a fairly major tourist/haunted attraction, so it may be fairly busy on Halloween.
I vote we get Bloodstains to hold a Q&A session.
And yes, I'll hold your hand when it gets scary.

I am a history major with a strong interest in HP Lovecraft, as well as an amateur voiceover artist.
I would be happy to help out at such an event with some Lovecraft readings, or dramatic readings of the best of NoSleep.
I also have a pretty strong knowledge of local sites in Providence which are Lovecraft-related, referenced in stories, etc., though that's more nerdy than creepy.

i'd be down for this, providing i could cover travel costs.
i'd even be game for roadtripping with other people from the southeastern united states to save on money, if it came to that.
in terms of places to go, i remember from living in california that there are quite a few ghost towns around there ( calico springs to mind).
maybe not quite as creepy as you were thinking, but it has several advantages:
las vegas and los angeles (or burbank, if you're smart) are good hubs for people to fly into.
it would be easy to contact the owners of a ghost town to see if they would be willing to host us.
they would be more likely to say yes than the owner of, say, an abandoned property.
alternately, we could go for a big fucking camping trip in a state park.
campfires in the middle of the woods are good venues for scary stories, in my experience.
also: all else fails and the original idea falls through, we could still organize a trip to knott's scary farm or something.

I live fairly close to Eastern State Penitentiary and it's fairly accessible.
The problem is that most haunted locations like ESP, Waverly Hills, etc. usually have Halloween events of their own going on during that time period.
But maybe a little earlier or later in the month would work?

I am all over the north american and north european part of the world, and just finished a year-long course in writing: bring it on!
As for location... my first thought was of the City on the Hill, also known as Harrisburg State Hospital, the hospital formerly known as Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital.
They've opened their doors to the public a few times, had Ghost Lab go through a few years ago (and Girl, Interrupted, a long time ago).
What might be handy in setting a location: a map showing the geographical density of interested nosleepers?

I'll throw Pennhurst ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennhurst_State_School_and_Hospital ) into the mix.
Located about 45 mins outside of Philadelphia.
Philly has a really good tourist type haunted house ( http://www.easternstate.org/ ).
Then of course the icing on the cake would be Gettysburg ( http://www.gettysburgghosttours.com/ )
I'm not good at the posting of links but I really think SE PA has a lot to offer.
Also, look into the covered bridge's suicides in the Bucks, Berks, and Montgomery counties.
Grew up hearing of lots of good ghost sightings associated with all the covered bridges.

Dear /r/nosleep Gods please make it at the Winchester House in Northern California!
I have always wanted to go there but not with a stupid tour group.
It is huge and we could probably rent it out depending on how many go.
For the love of all that is scary and awesome, make it happen!!!
I am almost positive, depending on how much it will be, that I will go no matter where it is because you guys rock my socks but you would make my life complete if it is at the Winchester house =)

Interested - hell yes
Travel - as far as I can afford
Activities - Scheduled readings by monthly winners, open mic readings, flashlight tours of the creepy place, workshops, etc
Only if you hold mine.
As far as location...I would suggest holding a survey of r/nosleep to find out where most of us are from.
That way, we could try to place the event closest to the larger population density.
I would also say trying to place it near a city with an airport.
That might simplify things for those who aren't close to the final location.

I know a couple of places here in Colorado.
Gold camp road, it's these three tunnels where supposedly a bus full of school kids crashed and never left.
My friend said that girls would get scratched and pushed and bite marks and stuff like that.
Another friend of mine said she saw a little girl in a white dress with her mom covered in blood.
And people who go there never leave alone.... Another place is famous from Stephen kings "the shining."
the Stanley hotel.
I'm pretty sure all you redditors have hear of it  Here's some more information on gold camp.

I'm down for meeting anywhere between the Florida Keys and Orlando (I live in Ft Lauderdale).
There's a museum in the keys that is supposedly haunted.
They have a doll that gets up and walks around at night (think his name is Robert or something).
I like it because it might be easy to convince them to let us stay overnight (if we pay for security guard) and because IT'S THE FREAKIN' FLORIDA KEYS.
Who doesn't like the florida keys.

I think just about anywhere you choose, there are going to be stories of some type of haunting.
How macabre, scary, realistic, consistent, those are things I would be curious about.
And I think we have a fine selection of writers here that could speak, if they would.
Otherwise, I know in the various places I've traveled, there seems to be a TAPS type of group in most locales.

I'd love to go and be apart of this.
Up in Virgina I think colonial Williamsberg does haunted tours for a Halloween meetup.
I'm not going to lie there is a sandwich shop that I'm hoping is still there when I last went a few years ago.
I have ulterior motives for picking there.
Or find some creepy abandon hospital and stay a night in there.
Activities wise I think exploring abandoned places with out getting arrested would be a blast.

How about at Mansfield Reformatory!
Its only 1 hour north of Columbus and "50% of the United States population lives within a 500 mile radius of Columbus"

I can probably get us access to a "haunted house" out in the middle of nowhere.
I don't know if folks would come to Cayce Ky for this though.
I also have access to forest.

This certainly sounds... interesting.
I think that I would most likely go if it was within driving distance.
For me to fly it would have to be REALLY awesome, with a ton to offer so I feel like I get value out of the trip.
Otherwise, I would also like to just see an event like this go down just because it would be an awesome precedent to set for the rest of reddit, even if it can only be people within driving distance.
That would still be a lot of people.

As much as I'd love to travel for something like this, Cali is a stretch because I'd have to fly.
What about doing one on each coast?

You should totally consider the Queen Mary in Long Beach as a meeting place.
We can all take the ghost tour, too.

Lemp Mansion, St. Louis.
Nice and centrally located.
Also, I want to meet Dathan (1000Vultures)!

I would definitely be interested and would love attending, unfortunately I live in Canada and lack the transportation or passport to go to the US.
This seems like an awesome idea though so I definitely hope it works out!

That would be cool, but if it was out of state, I wouldn't go unless sufficiently awesome.
You could always do Lemp Mansion in St.Louis, MO.
I'm sure they wouldn't mind, and they have tours there anyways.
You should let people set up booths or make different areas on type.
(ie, paranormal, dreams, killers, etc).
And yes, but you'd have to deal with the clawmarks.

I don't think I would travel across the country for it, but it sounds awesome.
I would definitely go it it was close enough to me (I live in NY) even if that meant I couldn't go this year and next year it was over here.

I would vote for a New Jersey location.
Weird NJ is a big thing here.

It would be good to have little pockets of people and have one major writer on here from each place organize it.
Like, for example, maybe we have people meet somewhere in New England and you know?

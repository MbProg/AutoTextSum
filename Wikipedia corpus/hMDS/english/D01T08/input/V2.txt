The perfect English country house?
Built for Sir John Brownlow in the 1680s, Belton House has all the design features of a classic English country home.
Sitting in formal Italian and Dutch gardens and an historic 1300 acre deer park, Belton is often cited as the quintessential country house estate.
The estate also includes a restaurant, café and indoor play area, gift and garden shops and the recently restored outdoor adventure playground (opens 31 March).
Belton Remembers
One hundred years ago, the tranquil and scenic parkland of the Belton estate was a very different place.
Lord Brownlow had given over a huge area of the park for the war effort and, in 1915, it became ‘home’ to tens of thousands of soldiers from the Machine Gun Corps.
In 2015 Belton remembers this vital and fascinating part of its history.
Come and explore the impact that the presence of the camp had on the estate, and discover stories of people who prepared for war in such a stately setting.
There will be exhibitions in the mansion and stables throughout the year as well as events to mark the centenary such as living history, a garden fête, walks and talks.
Adult £14.50 (inc gift aid) House & Grounds

Hi Manjit - I think we met at Anglesey Abbey?
Very happy for you to join me at the b&b.
The 2 places I want to visit on Saturday would cost £15 total (unless you are NT member), b&b is £35, dinner at the pub/b&b Sat night would be £12-£30.
Happy to pick you up from Bedford 9am Saturday 2nd.
B&B is a cottage adjoining a pub which has 2 double bedrooms.

Thinking of making a weekend of it and going up Saturday to visit other NT places (Southwell Workhouse & Tattershall Castle).
Have found a lovely 2 bed cottage to stay in which is only £35 pppn b&b. Anyone care to join me (ideally female and someone I've already met!!)
.
The cottage is 30min from Belton House.

Hello Dee, we usually manage to arrange transport amongst ourselves - post where you are coming from if you need a lift or if you can offer one.
Thank you :)

The UK is full of Stately Homes, Country Houses and Gardens - let's get together and visit some!
Many properties are designed by famous architects, have been homes to gentry, are rich in art and steeped in history.
What better way to discover them than with like minded new friends?
We intend to tour the House and Gardens and wider Parkland if time permits with picnicking en mass in the grounds or a Country House Cream Tea if the weather isn't quite up to croquet!
Ideas from members for future venues are strongly encouraged!

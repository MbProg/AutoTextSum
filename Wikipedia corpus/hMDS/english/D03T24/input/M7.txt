Adhere and Prosper
Mocatta (also de Mattos Mocatta, Lumbroso de Mattos Mocatta and Lumbrozo de Mattos Mocatta) is the name of a prominent Anglo-Jewish family originally from Spain known for philanthropy, leadership and sponsorship of arts and letters, particularly in the United Kingdom.
Long involved in finance, commerce, and the law, they are considered to be one of the principal families in the "cousinhood" of senior Anglo-Jewish families, the de facto Anglo-Jewish aristocracy.
As such, the Mocatta family has been related over the past two centuries to many of the prominent Jewish families of Europe and to a lesser extent Asia, including d'Avigdor, Cohen, Cruse, Goldsmid, Henriques, Kadoorie, Lousada, Marks, Montefiore, Rothschild and Samuel.
History
The origin of the name Mocatta is unknown.
Potential origins include: (i) Mukattil, Arabic for champion, or (ii) a river called Wadi Mokatta, or (iii) mukata, Arabic for fortress.
The family left Spain in 1492 and settled in France, the Netherlands and Italy after the Alhambra Decree of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella expelled the Jews from Spain and began the Spanish Inquisition.
Some moved to England following Oliver Cromwell's readmission of Jews to England.
In the mid 17th century, Antonio de Marchena, a Marrano from a branch of the Mocatta family that had stayed in Spain, left for the Netherlands, and was welcomed back into the Amsterdam Spanish & Portuguese community, adopting the name Moses Mocatta.
By 1670 he had taken his family to London.
In 1671 Moses Mocatta founded a bullion brokerage firm in Camomile Street in the City of London, known as Mocatta & Goldsmid after Asher Goldsmid joined in 1783.
The world's oldest bullion house, it exists today largely as ScotiaMocatta.
In 1790, one branch of the family obtained a royal licence from King George III to cease the use of "Lumbrozo de Mattos".
During the 19th century members of the Mocatta family were amongst the founders of British Reform Judaism.

"Sir" Alan Abraham Mocatta
(27 June 1907-1 November 1990) was an English judge. . . After attending Clifton College and New College, Oxford, he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1930 . . . In 1982 he served as Treasurer of the Inner Temple.

Inner Temple
The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple, commonly known as Inner Temple, is one of the four Inns of Court (professional associations for barristers and judges) in London.
To be called to the Bar and practise as a barrister in England and Wales, an individual must belong to one of these Inns.
It is located in the wider Temple area of the capital, near the Royal Courts of Justice, and within the City of London.
The Temple takes its name from the Knights Templar, who originally leased the land to the inhabitants of the Temple (or Templars) until their abolition in 1312.
The Inner Temple was certainly a distinct society from at least 1388, although as with all the Inns of Court their precise date of founding is not known.
After a disruptive early period (during which the Temple was almost entirely destroyed in the Peasant's Revolt http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasant%27s_Revolt) it flourished, becoming the second largest Inn during the Elizabethan period (after Gray's Inn).
Liberty
Inner Temple (and the neighbouring Middle Temple) is also one of the few remaining liberties, an old name for a geographic division.
It is an independent extra-parochial area,[39] historically not governed by the City of London Corporation[40] (and is today regarded as a local authority for most purposes[41]) and equally outside the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Bishop of London.
It geographically falls within the boundaries and liberties of the City, but can be thought of as an independent enclave.
Notable members
Significant members of the judiciary include Sir Edward Coke,[84] Lady Justice Butler-Sloss,[85] and Lord Justice Birkett.
[86] Several barrister members have gone on to be highly important, including Edward Marshall-Hall, and legal academics have also been members, such as Sir John Baker.
[85] Prime Ministers Clement Attlee and George Grenville have both been members, as was the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
[85] Outside of the law and politics, members have included the poet Arthur Brooke, Admiral Francis Drake, dramatist W. S. Gilbert, the economist John Maynard Keynes and diplomat and Righteous among the Nations Prince Constantin Karadja.

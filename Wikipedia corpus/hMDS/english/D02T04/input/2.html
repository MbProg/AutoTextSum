        <p>After the first World War, in an attempt to creating an independent Vietnam against the French and a nationalist government, Hồ Chí Minh petitions US President Woodrow Wilson for assistance, but is refused.  The reason may be due to the Communist leanings of Hồ Chí Minh.</p>
<p>On March of 1945, Japan successfully defeats the French authority ruling Indochina resulting in Vietnam becoming a puppet state.  After Japan’s surrender in August of the same year, 1945, the ruling Japanese administration in Indochina give Hồ Chí Minh control of the country of Vietnam.</p>

<hr>
<p>The role of the United States ended on that Spring day in 1973, but the North Vietnamese government continued its attempt to unify the country under communist rule.</p>
<p>South Vietnam President Thieu had vehemently asked to make changes on specific details of the Paris Peace Accords. North Vietnam undermined the process by making known the details of the Peace Accord, thus causing embarrassment to both US and South Vietnam.</p>
<p>After the exit of the United States in its involvement in the Vietnam War, both North and South refreshed the war, declaring the Paris Peace Accord was no longer in effect.</p>

Abstract
Henry II (1519-1559) of France was the second son of Francis I (1494-1547) and Claude de France (1498-1524) born in 1519 in St. Germain-en-Laye.
After his older brother's and his father's death in 1547, he was anointed the French king in Reims.
In 1533 already, as a 14-year-old boy, for reasons of state, he was married to the same aged Catherine de Medici (1519-1589), as her uncle was Pope Clement VII (1478-1534).
The marriage remained childless for 11 years since Henry, due to a distinct hypospadia and a completely sexually inexperienced wife was unable to conceive children with her.
His existing liaison to Diane de Poitiers (1499-1566) - a 19-year-older maid of honor of his father Francis I from 1537 until his death - influenced his sexual life immensely.The blame for the childless marriage was placed primarily on his wife, as Henry had become father of an illegitimate daughter with a mistress.
Catherine then underwent all possible medical and alchemical procedures to finally give birth to the hoped Dauphin.
Ironically, her rival for the favor of her husband, Diane de Poitiers was one of her greatest allies.
She made clear that the cause lay with Henry and not with his wife.
This was confirmed by the added solid physician Jean Fernel (1497-1558).
His treatment of Henry and the simultaneous training of the unexperienced Catherine by Diane de Poitiers led to success.The result was the birth of Francis II (1544-1560) in 1544, the first of 10 children in 12 years.
Thus, the dynasty was saved.
After the death of Henry in a tragic tournament accident in 1559, three of his sons became kings of France.
But the line of Valois remained without further descendants and was continued by Henry IV, the first Bourbon king in 1589.

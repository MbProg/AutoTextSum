For an example:

Any help is very good.

the romans had the best Chefs and cooks, never tell the french.
and from places or cities where these dishes were done frequently or originated, they were taken by Chefs that went to other countries (Catherine de Medici when she married a French hot shot, complained to her Italian father that the food there was lousy.
So the old man sent her some good Chefs from his kitchen and that's how the story started the french can cook...).
This is also true for PARMA Ham, truffles from PIEMONT, and so forth

"Bolognese", "Napoletana", "Romana" aren't nouns with cities' names inside: they are adjectives!
For ex a person living in Bologna is bolognese!
As a person living in Roma is romano (man) or romana (woman)!
A person living in Milan is milanese... and in this way for every Italian city.
So, dishes have adjectives because they are typical of that city.
Spaghetti alla bolognese: means that sauce of pasta (we call it ragù or also ragù alla bolognese) was "invented" in Bologna.
Ok?

Probably from where they originated.
However, it could also be from where a certain famous chef made them famous.

the romans had the best Chefs and cooks, never tell the french. and from places or cities where these dishes were done frequently or originated, they were taken by Chefs that went to other countries (Catherine de Medici when she married a French hot shot, complained to her Italian father that the food there was lousy. So the old man sent her some good Chefs from his kitchen and that's how the story started the french can cook...). 
This is also true for PARMA Ham, truffles from PIEMONT, and so forth

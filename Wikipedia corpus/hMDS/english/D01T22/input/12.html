<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the exception of its 
neighbour, All Hallows&#146; church, Bruce Castle is Tottenham&#146;s oldest surviving 
building, and its second most famous after White Hart Lane Stadium.<br>
<br>
How it came by its name is a somewhat convoluted story. At the time of the Norman 
Conquest the manor of Tottenham belonged to Waltheof, Earl of Huntingdon, one 
of the few Saxon magnates to retain his lands. He married the Conqueror&#146;s 
niece, Judith, and their daughter Maud married David, King of Scotland, who acquired 
the Earldom of Huntingdon (Waltheof having been executed for treason in 1075). 
Eventually, the manor passed to the Bruis, or Bruce, family, who built the original 
manor house on this site in 1254. The family&#146;s English lands were sequestered 
by Edward I in 1306, after Robert the Bruce&#146;s rebellion.<br>
<br>
The present house dates from the early sixteenth century; it was acquired by Sir 
William Compton in 1514, and comprehensively rebuilt; in 1516 Henry VIII met his 
sister Margaret of Scotland here, and Elizabeth I stayed here in 1578, as a guest 
of Sir William&#146;s grandson Henry. <br>
<br>
Up until the latter part of the seventeenth century the house was known as &#145;The 
Lordship&#146;. It is shown thus on a map of 1619, at which time it was the home 
of Sir Thomas Penniston. This title appears to have been insufficiently grandiose 
for a later owner, Henry Hare, 2nd Baron (later Lord) Coleraine (1636&#150;1708), 
who renamed it, having (presumably) had a root through ancient documents in order 
to find something suitable.<br>
<br>
Bruce Castle has never had any military function. The purpose of the curious tower 
to the left has been a matter of speculation for many years, but recent research 
has discovered that it was built to house falcons.<br>
<br>
In the 19th century the house became a school run by the brother of Rowland Hill, 
famed for the introduction of the penny post. It was widely renowned and applauded 
for its progressive teaching methods (no corporal punishment, for instance). After 
the Hills gave it up it continued as a school until the early 20th century, for 
some reason having a particular attraction for pupils from Latin America. It is 
now a museum with permanent exhibitions devoted to Haringey in times past and 
to Rowland Hill.</font></p>

represents Bruce Castle as it was in the late seventeenth century, a typical large 
manor house in the Tudor/Jacobean style. Elizabeth I would have recognised it. 
The figure in the driveway is probably Lord Coleraine himself. He may have been 
responsible for the wall (built, presumably, to keep the unwashed at a distance&#151;it 
is possible that at one time the house was moated), and certainly for the tower 
over the front entrance. From its observation platform, he could be lord of all 
he surveyed. And, although the house stands at an apparently insignificant elevation, 
the view from the platform is astonishing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At some time in the eighteenth 
century, Bruce Castle was extensively remodelled to bring it into line with the 
Classical tastes of Georgian England. The windows have been narrowed, the gables 
are gone, as are the mock-crenellations on the projecting wings, whilst the fa&ccedil;ade 
has been raised to the level of the old gable-peaks and treated, apparently, to 
a coat of stucco. The little turret on the tower has gone, and the wall in front 
of the house has been demolished and replaced by iron railings, which allowed 
the plebs to see their betters&#146; home and marvel at it whilst still keeping 
them at a respectful distance. Its continuation, just out of picture to the right, 
survives to this day.<br>
<br>
This view was drawn about 1770, when the house was owned by Alderman Townsend&#151;one 
assumes that is him giving a guided tour to a lady visitor (or is he discussing 
the next round of home improvements with Mrs. Townsend?).</font></p>

This is an excellent museum on many levels. I like just wandering in their occasionally and poking around the different artifacts.
The history spans from Roman times up to the present day with excellent pictorial and recreative displays of the history of Haringey and Tottenham.
I've taken groups of kids here and they were facinated with the artifacts and information that was presented to them.
I like best that there is still an oral tradition in the community, many children had told me about it, of a lady ghost who leaps off the tower every halloween.

Located close to Tottenham, the Bruce Castle Museum is an odd sort of place. It has a feel of a small town museum, rather than one in the metropolis. The old house, still grand despite historical modifications, is charming, whilst also in need of some TLC (which in this case might mean tonnes of lottery cash).

Inside the exhibitions are varied and interesting though perhaps a little worn around the edges. It seems as if all the historic items of interest and value stored by Haringey Council have been dumped here, and arranged wherever possible into some sort of coherent order.

The variety is interesting, but means in truth there is a lack of quality exhibits in any one genre. There are small exhibits on local sport, the history of the house (including ghost story), local life during World War Two, the growth of Tottenham, picture-filled corridors on the ground floor and a larger exhibition space upstairs.

The most interesting exhibit within the museum, and possibly the only one that would genuinely justify a visit is located on the ground floor. Where the rest of the museum is a hotch-potch of items the exhibit relating to Broadwater Farm Estate is excellent.

Based on a university research project, the large exhibit looks closely into the building and development of the infamous housing estate associated with the 1980s riots.

It is fascinating how badly conceived the estate was in the first place, then how poorly built. The levels of deprivation and crime, and the eventual riots are widely known, but what is excellently presented is the subsequent creation, development and success of a growing community unity.

The story of the Broadwater Farm Estate may be best known for the violence, but that would be wrong. The colourful, dedicated and determined community leaders that brought the estate back from the brink are modern heroes, and their story deserves to be more widely known.

Generally I would find it hard to recommend the Bruce Castle Museum to anyone who had not yet exhausted London's larger and grander offerings. But the permanent exhibition on the Broadwater Farm Estate is informative, thought-provoking and gives a sense of hope for the good nature of people, and a reminder of what communities can achieve when working together.

It would be fair to say the exhibit would benefit from an update, but for those with an interest in London's built and social evolution will find it fascinating and easily worth the visit.

Bruce Castle is a Grade I listed 16th Century manor house in 20 acres of parkland. I went to school a few streets away and we visited this small white castle a few times.

It is definitely well kept, and being as old as it is, it is full of history. The main exhibitions were on the World Wars, it was almost like an Army museum.

This is a huge part of Tottenham Heritage, the one thing that stands, and in many ways, the Tottenham local should be very proud of it, Henry VIII actually funded certain parts of the building to be completed in his years as King.

Lovely museum in an old manor (free admittance!), surrounded by a fantastic park with most beautiful trees and great children's playground.

Well worth a visit if you are in North London and have an interest in local history. Visit on the annual annual Open London day in the early autumn and get the chance to visit the top of the clock tower. Legend has it that an imprisoned woman was thrown to her death from here. All very gory! Nice cafe serving tea and home made cakes. The park that the museum is set in has some fantastic old oak trees. Watch your pockets though, some of the local characters look a bit dodgy.

Bruce Castle is a fantastic place to be. The castle is a grade 1 listed bulding. The park surrounding it is lovely and in summer you can have a picnic there. They have got workshops, events, tours and also talks about the local history. They usually have got exhibitions which are really interesting. When I was there we had a picnic and it was lovely day. It is a good place to go on a weekend to have a look at the museum and the local archives.

Entry to the museum is free but you must check the opening hours because I don't think they open all day.

This is a great place for a family day out as is surrounded by open grass and alarge park. The buliding itself is quite old which lives up to its name of museum. Inside there are different topics covered like Black history month and also has different things like story writing for children and book reading. There is a childs area inside which holds different activities at weekends. Its especially good at Summer holidays and half terms.

This is really good place for the whole family and i recommend it.

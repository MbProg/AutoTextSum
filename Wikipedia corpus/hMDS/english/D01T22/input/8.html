              the early years of the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the 
              de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued

              Civil War, when Parliament ordered the defences to be slighted to

              Henry VIII visited Gainsborough twice; once in 1509 and again in 
              1541 with the doomed Queen Catherine Howard. The Queen was accused 
              of indiscretions both at Gainsborough and nearby Lincoln, for which

            <p class="caption">The Old Hall has changed very little over the years. 
              It is principally a timber framed building, giving it its characteristic 
              'striped' or 'black and white' appearance. On the north east corner 
              is a brick tower. The Hall with its elaborate timber roof survives 
              as well as the kitchen&#151;possibly the most complete medieval 
              kitchen in England. The kitchen still contains many original features, 
              including two open fireplaces, each large enough to roast an ox, 
              and two bread ovens served by a third chimney. </p>

            <p class="caption">Lindisfarne Castle is a 16th-century castle much 
              altered by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1901. The island is accessible from 
              the mainland at low tide by means of a causeway. The castle is located 
              in what was once the very volatile border area between England and 
              Scotland. Not only did the English and Scots fight, but the area 
              was frequently attacked by Vikings. The castle was built in 1550, 
              around the time that Lindisfarne Priory went out of use, and stones 
              from the priory were used as building material. It is very small 
              by the usual standards, and was more of a fort.</p>
            <p class="caption">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="caption">After Henry VIII suppressed the priory here, his 
              troops used the remains as a naval store. In 1542 Henry VIII ordered 
              the Earl of Rutland to fortify the site against possible Scottish 
              invasion. Elizabeth I had further work carried out on the fort, 
              strengthening it and providing gun platforms for the new developments 
              in artillery technology. </p>
            <p class="caption">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="caption"> In 1901, the castle became the property of Edward 
              Hudson, a publishing magnate and the owner of Country Life magazine. 
              He had it refurbished in the Arts and Crafts style by Sir Edwin 
              Lutyens.</p>

              Barelegs). In the early 14th century, the majority of the present 
              walls and towers were built, primarily from local red sandstone. 
              After the Vikings, the castle continued to be used by the Church 
              due to the cathedral built along with the castle &#150; the cathedral 
              church of the Sodor Diocese. The cathedral was eventually abandoned

            <p class="caption">New defensive positions were added as late as 1860. 
              The buildings within the castle are now mostly ruined, but the outer 
              walls remain intact. Excavations in 1982-87 revealed an extensive 
              graveyard as well as the remains of Magnus Bareleg's original wooden 
              fort. The most spectacular finds were the 10th century grave of 
              &quot;The Pagan Lady&quot; which included a fine example of a Viking 
              necklace and a cache of silver coins dating from about 1030. The 
              Castle's most famous resident is reputed to be Moddey Dhoo, a Black 
              Dog ghost .The castle is now owned by Manx National Heritage and 
              is open to visitors during the summer. Peel Castle is a possible

              the Norman Invasion of 1066, Tamworth was granted to Robert Despenser, 
              steward to William the Conqueror. Robert died childless and so the 
              castle passed to a daughter of his brother Urse d'Abetot's, Matilida, 
              who married Robert de Marmion. The Marmion family, from Fontenay-le-Marmion, 
              Normandy, held the castle for 6 generations from c.1100 - 1294. 
              The Marmion family were hereditary champions to the Dukes of Normandy 
              and then of the new Kings of England. This role required them to

              Restoration, Charles II rebuilt much of Windsor Castle with the 
              help of architect Hugh May, creating a set of extravagant, Baroque 
              interiors that are still admired. After a period of neglect during 
              the 18th century, George III and George IV renovated and rebuilt 
              Charles II's palace at colossal expense, producing the current design 
              of the State Apartments, full of Rococo, Gothic and Baroque furnishings. 
              Victoria made minor changes to the castle, which became the centre 
              for royal entertainment for much of her reign. Windsor Castle was 
              used as a refuge for the royal family during the bombing campaigns 
              of the Second World War and survived a fire in 1992.</p>

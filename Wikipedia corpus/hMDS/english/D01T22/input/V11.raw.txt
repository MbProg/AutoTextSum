Bruce Castle is a Grade I listed 16th century manor house in 20 acres of parkland. William Compton - a member of Henry VIII’s court - built the oldest surviving parts of the building.
Since then the building has been modified several times by new owners including the Coleraine family. One of the wives of the 2nd Lord Coleraine is said to haunt the building. Sir Rowland Hill's family ran a progressive school for boys at Bruce Castle during the Victorian period. Sir Rowland reformed the British postal system and became famous for introducing the Penny Post.
Bruce Castle opened as a Museum in 1906 and now houses the Borough of Haringey's local history collections and archives.

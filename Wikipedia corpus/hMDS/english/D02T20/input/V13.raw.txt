Re: Why does Great Britain get the best infantry, and the most infantry?
Oh, dear, oh dear. My willy is bigger than yours! And history is unfair, it shouldn't have been like that, because my willy is bigger than yours.
Boohoohoo
Yes, sometimes the "bad guys" win and they get to write history (in their language
Bastards
).
The losers might say the "bad guys" win all the time...
Anyway, shouldn't this thread be closed own it really has descended into silliness.

Drakon, what valuable resources were left in Europe? Apart from pride, the worlds wealth was elsewhere. As the Dutch found out in the 1500s-1700s and the British from 1780 to 1960 odd.

"We brits take it very serious indeed" all volunteers in the 18th and 19th centurys. Rule Britania...... lol
No they really did not, becuase they had a navy that dominated the seas and won the wars for them.
How come you got owned by children and peasants in... america?

Without this ability, CA you are truly dead to me. You've taken away my single reason to play your games past the first month of its release.
It's okay sillyfrenchman, CA has said thiat ETW will be more moddable than M2tw, so just give it about 3 weeks before you jump to conclusions.

When did the Brits won a war alone againt the french ?
Not 1700-1799, not even during the napoleonic period, since the beginning of times.
Answer for you: never. Sorry.

The british infantry was superior to the Grande Armée of Napoléon?
Interesting, and quite arrogant... considering that it took 7 coalitions of almost all European nations of that time to defeat the french army.

Agreed here. But well, we cant change history.

We didn't though did we. Look at the amount of major battles that the British army won there. You only need look at history to see that a large professional army struggles against irregular troops in their own back yard...
Vietnam
Afghanistan (Both the Russians and now)
Chechnya
3 perfectly valid examples of major powers being unable to defeat local resistance.
War as never as simple as the result. There's a million factors and variables that can effect the result.

Don't be dumb, Britain didn't even throw a quarter of her military might against America. Busy in Europe, and to top it all of King George didn't really give a
that some farmers were in a hubub and rebelling.
And don't accuse me of being nationalistic, I'm not British.

Re: Why does Great Britain get the best infantry, and the most infantry?
Brittan got good infantry because they had a proffesional army?
Brittan got loads of infantry becasue they have a global empire resoulting in loads of cash?
Now what part did you not understand? Also Brittis infantry should be expensive, bu could be fielded on mass if you have loads of cash, that is historicly correct. Now are they expensive compeared to the otehr factions line infantry?
Also Sweden should have the best line infantry compeared to cost, sence we combined a semi conscript system (2 peasnet household all across the country are responsible for bringin up one man or a money to compensate) and that Sweden had really high training.
EDIT: Also how can you say that brittain got the best army? They haven't even any armoured cavalry! Guys every other European nation got Curiass that wipe the floor with thoses English noob cavalry.

Re: Why does Great Britain get the best infantry, and the most infantry?
Seems really that CA has barely been able to finish the British faction and little else. Most other factions get the standard issue of clone units. Even Gibraltar (that was a non issue till 1713) was created in for Britain campaign fans.
Read a napoleonic first hand account of a Hessian serving under the french flag
Athenians: For ourselves, we shall not trouble you with specious pretenses - either of how we have a right to our empire because we overthrew the Mede, or are now attacking you because of wrong that you have done us- and make a long speech which would not be believed;.......... since you know as well as we do that right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.

Re: Why does Great Britain get the best infantry, and the most infantry?
French and Indian war, and that's off the top of my head. Shh now Sir. Oh, we sunk your navy in WW2 too. Are you also forgetting Napoleon wasn't French? So, in effect. It was a Corsican led conscript French army that did so well.

No you can't, Napoleon lost, then 100 years later nearly a million British soldiers died on French soil defending it from the Germans.
Its a freakin game and if you've ever played TW games before you'll know that after a few go's you can defeat any army no matter if the stats are slightly better, the difference is negligable.
If you want to debate history come to the VV section and we'll put to the test some of your woefully misinformed facts, particularly about the Peninsular war.

Never accused you for anything.
Still, it might not ahve been full power, but In america the forces was quite even, and still....
Maybe you could give an example of why Englands army really was the best? Like some battles or a Great War where you are outnumbered and surrounded and ........still pwn?

Re: Why does Great Britain get the best infantry, and the most infantry?
Did not see the french put up a fight when the panzers were mincing through the Arc De Triumph. Dishing out the French Fancies on a plate to the Fuhrer
So no variety for the french as they were naughty...

I hope so. Why go to hexadecimal databases anyway? I mean, does reading a text file over a hex involve that much more resource usage? :hmmm:And why in god's name did they use STEAM? That thing has = sh-t since it was introduced with HL2. Use a registration database instead of Steam trash! Make ETW optionally available to people who like Steam (godforsaken as they are), but don't require it!
Oh well /rant

Re: Why does Great Britain get the best infantry, and the most infantry?
Why do you not get back on topic? This is not about how great/uber one nation is against the other but the fact that CA has overemphitized the British faction over the others. Most nations at that time had an equal amount of "special" forces. To focus only on the Brits is doing the game a diservice.

Re: Why does Great Britain get the best infantry, and the most infantry?
All countries at that time fought with the help of allies.France certainly had the help of Poles,Germans,Italians in all its Napoleonic battles,not just in Russia .1814 campaign on their own I suppose.Britain had allies of course as did all the other countries. If you want me to name a single battle where the British beat the French without help..well I can but what's the point ?

One word: agriculture
More food = more soldiers.
A reason why France, for instance, didnt see colonial empires as must-have during the ancient-régime: France was rich enough to sustain a big army without colonies. Our kings saw the colonies only are a bonus, and Napoléon didnt believe in them at all.
(they were all wrong)
Note: the french had a colonial empire, and a rather big one too.
12,347,000 km² (4,767,000 sq. miles) for the french
against 13,000,000 square miles 33,670,000 km² (13,000,000 sq. miles) for the British Empire... modest yes!
but still...

Disagree with that - look at RTW, you trying to tell me the brits are good in that? Apart from chosen swordmen, their units are poor mate.

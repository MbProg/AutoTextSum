HISTORY
GREAT SIOUX RESERVATION
Arguments
Crow Dog: federal court lacked jurisdiction, pointing to an 1834 act that specifically excluded crimes committed by one Native American on another from federal jurisdiction
Gov't: 1868 treaty with the Sioux, that required the tribe surrender criminals to United States, superseded the earlier statute.
With a 9-0 decision, the Court concluded that Congress had not granted federal courts jurisdiction over the murder of one Native American by another.
CROW DOG RELEASED
Following the Ruling
The Major Crimes Act was passed in 1885 by Congress, placing 15 crimes on Indian land under federal authority if committed by one Indian against another.

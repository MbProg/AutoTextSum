Nevertheless, successful colonies were established. European settlers came from a variety of social and religious groups. No <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy" title="Aristocracy">aristocrats</a> settled permanently, but a number of adventurers, soldiers, farmers, and tradesmen arrived. Diversity was an American characteristic as the Dutch of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Netherland" title="New Netherland">New Netherland</a>, the <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Americans" title="Swedish Americans">Swedes</a> and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_American" title="Finnish American" class="mw-redirect">Finns</a> of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Sweden" title="New Sweden">New Sweden</a>, the English <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends" title="Religious Society of Friends" class="mw-redirect">Quakers</a> of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Pennsylvania" title="Province of Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, the English <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan" title="Puritan" class="mw-redirect">Puritans</a> of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a>, the English settlers of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia" title="Jamestown, Virginia">Jamestown</a>, and the "worthy poor" of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Georgia" title="Province of Georgia">Georgia</a>, came to the new continent and built colonies with distinctive social, religious, political and economic styles. Non-British colonies were taken over and the inhabitants were all assimilated, unlike in Nova Scotia, where the British expelled the French <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadians" title="Acadians">Acadian</a> inhabitants. There were no major civil wars among the 13&#160;colonies, and the two chief armed rebellions (in <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon%27s_Rebellion" title="Bacon's Rebellion">Virginia in 1676</a> and in <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisler%27s_Rebellion" title="Leisler's Rebellion">New York in 1689–91</a>) were short-lived failures.

By 1760, France was defeated and the British seized its colonies.</p>

<p>England, France and the Netherlands had also started colonies in both the West Indies and North America. They had the ability to build ocean-worthy ships, but did not have as strong a history of colonization in foreign lands as did Portugal and Spain.

<p><a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism" title="Mercantilism">Mercantilism</a> was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies from the 1660s. Mercantilism meant that the government and merchants based in England became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires and even merchants based in its own colonies. The government protected its London-based merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, especially by American merchants, some of whose activities (which included direct trade with the French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese) were classified as such by the <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_Acts" title="Navigation Acts">Navigation Acts</a>. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Amsterdam" title="New Amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a> (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Other countries did attempt to found colonies in what later became the United States over the following century, and most of these attempts ended in failure.

<p>England made its first successful efforts at the start of the 17th century for several reasons. During this era, English proto-nationalism and national assertiveness blossomed under the threat of Spanish invasion, assisted by a degree of Protestant militarism and the energy of Queen <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth</a>. At this time, however, there was no official attempt by the English government to create a colonial empire. Rather, the motivation behind the founding of colonies was piecemeal and variable. Practical considerations, such as commercial enterprise, overpopulation and the desire for freedom of religion, played their parts. The main waves of settlement came in the 17th century. After 1700 most immigrants to Colonial America arrived as <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servant" title="Indentured servant">indentured servants</a>—young unmarried men and women seeking a new life in a much richer environment.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution, the British shipped an estimated 50,000 convicts to its American colonies.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> The first <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convicts" title="Convicts" class="mw-redirect">convicts</a> to arrive pre-dated the arrival of the <i><a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower" title="Mayflower">Mayflower</a></i>.</p>

<p>The colonial assembly shared power with a royally appointed governor. On a more local level, governmental power was invested in county courts, which were self-perpetuating (the incumbents filled any vacancies and there never were popular elections). As cash crop producers, Chesapeake plantations were heavily dependent on trade with England. With easy navigation by river, there were few towns and no cities; planters shipped directly to Britain. High death rates and a very young population profile characterized the colony during its first years.<sup id="cite_ref-heinemann_30-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-heinemann-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Sports occupied a great deal of attention at every social level, starting at the top. In England hunting was sharply restricted to landowners, and enforced by armed gameskeepers.

At that time, tension between Spain and Great Britain was high, and the British feared that Spanish Florida was threatening the British Carolinas. Oglethorpe decided to establish a colony in the contested border region of Georgia and populate it with debtors who would otherwise have been imprisoned according to standard British practice. This plan would both rid Great Britain of its undesirable elements and provide her with a base from which to attack Florida. The first colonists arrived in 1733.<sup id="cite_ref-ciment_34-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ciment-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Georgia was established on strict moralistic principles. Slavery was officially forbidden, as were alcohol and other forms of immorality. However, the reality of the colony was far different. The colonists rejected a puritanical lifestyle and complained that their colony could not compete economically with the Carolina rice plantations. Georgia initially failed to prosper, but eventually the restrictions were lifted, slavery was allowed, and it became as prosperous as the Carolinas. The colony of Georgia never had an established religion. It consisted of people of various faiths.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial (<a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_colony" title="Royal colony" class="mw-redirect">royal colony</a>), proprietary, and charter.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Provincial_colonies">Provincial colonies</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colonial_history_of_the_United_States&amp;action=edit&amp;section=31" title="Edit section: Provincial colonies">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and eventually Massachusetts, were provincial, also called royal colonies.</p>
<p>The provincial government was governed by commissions created at pleasure by the monarch. A governor (and in some provinces his council) were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers, and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto, and could <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_session" title="Legislative session">prorogue</a> (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly.</p>
<p>The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of England. In practice this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies. They were governed much as royal colonies except that lord proprietors, rather than the king, appointed the governor. They were set up after the <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Restoration" title="English Restoration" class="mw-redirect">Restoration of 1660</a> and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty.<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Providence Plantation, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684, and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.</p>
<p>Charter governments were political corporations created by <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_patent" title="Letters patent">letters patent</a>, giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government.

<p>As Bonomi (1971) shows, the most distinctive feature of colonial society was the vibrant political culture, which attracted the most talented and ambitious young men into politics.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> First, suffrage was the most widespread in the world, with every man who owned a certain amount of property allowed to vote.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57"><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup> While fewer than 1% of British men could vote, a majority of white American men were eligible. The roots of democracy were present,<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58"><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup> although deference was typically shown to social elites in colonial elections.<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59"><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Second, in the colonies a very wide range of public and private business was decided by elected bodies, especially the assemblies and county governments in each colony.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60"><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup> They handled land grants, commercial subsidies, and taxation, as well as oversight of roads, poor relief, taverns, and schools.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61"><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> Americans sued each other at a very high rate, with binding decisions made not by a great lord but by local judges and juries. This promoted the rapid expansion of the legal profession, so that the intense involvement of lawyers in politics became an American characteristic by the 1770s.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62"><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Thirdly, the American colonies were exceptional in the world because of the representation of many different interest groups in political decision-making. Unlike Europe, where aristocratic families and the established church were in control, the American political culture was open to economic, social, religious, ethnic and geographical interests, with merchants, landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Quakers, Germans, <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch-Irish_American" title="Scotch-Irish American" class="mw-redirect">Scotch Irish</a>, Yankees, Yorkers, and many other identifiable groups taking part. Elected representatives learned to listen to these interests because 90% of the men in the lower houses lived in their districts, unlike England where it was common to have an absentee member of Parliament.<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63"><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, and most dramatically, the Americans were fascinated by and increasingly adopted the political values of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States" title="Republicanism in the United States">Republicanism</a>, which stressed equal rights, the need for virtuous citizens, and the evils of corruption, luxury, and aristocracy.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64"><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65"><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup> Republicanism provided the framework for colonial resistance to British schemes of taxation after 1763, which escalated into the Revolution.</p>
<p>None of the colonies had stable political parties of the sort that formed in the 1790s, but each had shifting factions that vied for power, especially in the perennial battles between the appointed governor and the elected assembly.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66"><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup> There were often "country" and "court" factions, representing those opposed to and in favor of, respectively, of the governor's actions and agenda. Massachusetts, which from its 1691 charter had particularly low requirements for voting eligibility and strong rural representation in its assembly, also had a strong populist faction that represented the province's lower classes.</p>
<p>Up and down the colonies non-English ethnic groups had clusters of settlements. The most numerous were the Scotch Irish<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67"><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup> and the Germans.<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68"><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup> Each group assimilated into the dominant English, Protestant commercial and political culture, albeit with local variations. They tended to vote in blocs and politicians negotiated with group leaders for votes. They generally retained their historic languages and cultural traditions, even as they merged into the emerging American culture.<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69"><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Ethnocultural factors were most visible in Pennsylvania. During 1756–76, the Quakers were the largest faction in the legislature, but they were losing their dominance to the emerging Presbyterian faction based on Scotch-Irish votes, supported by Germans.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70"><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War" title="Seven Years' War">Seven Years' War</a>. Although previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and then having spread to Europe. Increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley, was one of the primary origins of the war.<sup id="cite_ref-anderson_72-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-anderson-72"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt,_1st_Earl_of_Chatham" title="William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham">William Pitt the Elder</a> decided that, in order to win the war against France, major military resources needed to be devoted to North America.

During the war, the position of the British colonies as part of the <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> was made truly apparent, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in the lives of Americans. The war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men, who might normally have never left their own colony, to travel across the continent, fighting alongside men from decidedly different, yet still "American", backgrounds. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained American ones (most notably <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>) for battle—which would later benefit the American Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively, for the first time, in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.<sup id="cite_ref-anderson_72-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-anderson-72"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup> The relations between the British military establishment and the colonists were not always positive, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops.</p>

<p>The British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Prime_Minister" title="British Prime Minister" class="mw-redirect">British Prime Minister</a> William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy, but after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-anderson_72-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-anderson-72"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Another point on which the colonies found themselves more similar than different was the booming import of British goods. The British economy had begun to grow rapidly at the end of the 17th century, and by the mid-18th century, small factories in Britain were producing much more than the nation could consume. Finding a market for their goods in the British colonies of North America, Britain increased her exports to that region by 360% between 1740 and 1770.

Warfare was critical, for as Furstenberg, (2008) explains, from 1754 to 1815, the major imperial players – Britain, the American colonies, Spain, France, the First Nations (Indians) and the United States fought a series of conflicts that can be called a "Long War for the West" over control of the region.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77"><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In the colonial era, Americans insisted on their rights as Englishmen to have their own legislature raise all taxes. Tax loads in practice were very light, and far lower than in England. Beginning in 1765 the British Parliament asserted its supreme authority to lay taxes, and a series of American protests began that led directly to the American Revolution.

<p>The Parliament attempted a series of taxes and punishments which met more and more resistance: First <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartering_Act" title="Quartering Act" class="mw-redirect">Quartering Act</a> (1765); <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaratory_Act" title="Declaratory Act">Declaratory Act</a> (1766); <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_Revenue_Act" title="Townshend Revenue Act" class="mw-redirect">Townshend Revenue Act</a> (1767); and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Act" title="Tea Act">Tea Act</a> (1773).

It was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants that swept the colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on American religion. <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)" title="Jonathan Edwards (theologian)">Jonathan Edwards</a>, perhaps most powerful intellectual in colonial America, was a key leader. <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Whitefield" title="George Whitefield">George Whitefield</a> came over from England and made many converts. The Great Awakening emphasized the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching, rudimentary liturgy, and a deep sense of personal guilt and redemption by Christ Jesus. It resulted from powerful preaching that deeply affected listeners with a deep sense of personal guilt and salvation by Christ. Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made religion personal to the average person.<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91"><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

It brought Christianity to the slaves and was an apocalyptic event in New England that challenged established authority. It incited rancor and division between the new revivalists and the old traditionalists who insisted on ritual and doctrine.

<p>The experiences of women during the colonial era varied greatly from colony to colony. In New England, the Puritan settlers brought their strong religious values with them to the New World, which dictated that a woman be subordinate to her husband and dedicate herself to rearing God-fearing children to the best of her ability. Hispanic women were at the center of family life in New Mexico and California.</p>
<p>There were ethnic differences in the treatment of women. Among Puritan settlers in New England, wives almost never worked in the fields with their husbands. In German communities in Pennsylvania, however, many women worked in fields and stables. German and Dutch immigrants granted women more control over property, which was not permitted in the local English law. Unlike English colonial wives, German and Dutch wives owned their own clothes and other items and were also given the ability to write wills disposing of the property brought into the marriage. Much later on in the colonial experience, as the values of the <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enlightenment" title="American Enlightenment">American Enlightenment</a> were imported from Britain, the philosophies of such thinkers as <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">John Locke</a> weakened the view that husbands were natural "rulers" over their wives and replacing it with a (slightly) more liberal conception of marriage. Women also lost most control of their property when marrying. Even single women could not sue anyone or be sued, or make contracts, and divorce was almost impossible until the late eighteenth century.<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93"><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>About 600,000 slaves were imported into what is now the U.S., or 5% of the 12 million slaves brought from Africa.

Slavery in colonial America was very oppressive, as it passed from generation to generation, and slaves had no legal rights.</p>
<p>The colonies that had the most specialization in agricultural production, such as sugar and coffee, and relied the most upon slaves, had the highest <i>per capita</i> (including slaves) income in the New World. However, the slaves did not accrue wages or receive rights; they provided free labor to those who purchased them, receiving just enough to live.

High-level politicians gave out plots of land to male settlers, or proprietors, who then divided the land amongst themselves. Large portions were usually given to men of higher social standing, but every white man—who wasn't indentured or criminally bonded—had enough land to support a family. Every male citizen had a voice in the town meeting. The town meeting levied taxes, built roads, and elected officials who managed town affairs. The towns did not have courts—that was a function of a larger unit, the county, whose officials were appointed by the state government.<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97"><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Instead, membership was limited to those who could convincingly "test" before members of the church that they had been saved.

<p>A majority of New England residents were small farmers. Within these small farm families, and English families as well, a man had complete power over the property and his wife. When married, an English woman lost her maiden name and personal identity, meaning she could not own property, file lawsuits, or participate in political life, even when widowed. The role of wives was to raise and nurture healthy children and support their husbands. Most women carried out these duties.<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99"><span>[</span>99<span>]</span></a></sup> During the 18th century, couples usually married between the ages of 20-24 and 6-8 children were typical of a family, with three on average surviving to adulthood. Farm women provided most of the materials needed by the rest of the family by spinning yarn from wool and knitting sweaters and stockings, making candles and soap from ashes, and churning milk into butter.<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100"><span>[</span>100<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Most New England parents tried to help their sons establish farms of their own. When sons married, fathers gave them gifts of land, livestock, or farming equipment; daughters received household goods, farm animals, and/or cash. <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranged_marriages" title="Arranged marriages" class="mw-redirect">Arranged marriages</a> were very unusual; normally, children chose their own spouses from within a circle of suitable acquaintances who shared their race, religion, and social standing. Parents retained veto power over their children's marriages.</p>
<p>New England farming families generally lived in wooden houses because of the abundance of trees. A typical New England farmhouse was one-and-a-half stories tall and had a strong frame (usually made of large square timbers) that was covered by wooden clapboard siding. A large chimney stood in the middle of the house that provided cooking facilities and warmth during the winter. One side of the ground floor contained a hall, a general-purpose room where the family worked and ate meals. Adjacent to the hall was the parlor, a room used to entertain guests that contained the family's best furnishings and the parent's bed. Children slept in a loft above, while the kitchen was either part of the hall or was located in a shed along the back of the house. Because colonial families were large, these small dwellings had much activity and there was little privacy.</p>
<p>By the middle of the 18th century, New England's way of life was threatened by overpopulation, going from about 100,000 people in 1700 to 250,000 in 1725 and 375,000 in 1750 thanks to high birth rates and relatively high overall life expectancy (a 15-year-old boy in 1700 could expect to live to about 63). As colonists in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island continued to subdivide their land between farmers, the farms became too small to support single families. This overpopulation threatened the New England ideal of a society of independent yeoman farmers.<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101"><span>[</span>101<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Some farmers obtained land grants to create farms in undeveloped land in Massachusetts and Connecticut or bought plots of land from speculators in New Hampshire and what later became Vermont. Other farmers became agricultural innovators. They planted nutritious English grass such as <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_clover" title="Red clover" class="mw-redirect">red clover</a> and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy-grass" title="Timothy-grass">timothy-grass</a>, which provided more feed for livestock, and potatoes, which provided a high production rate that was an advantage for small farms. Families increased their productivity by exchanging goods and labor with each other. They loaned livestock and grazing land to one another and worked together to spin yarn, sew quilts, and shuck corn. Migration, agricultural innovation, and economic cooperation were creative measures that preserved New England's yeoman society until the 19th century.</p>

They carried the West Indian products to New England factories where the raw sugar was turned into granulated sugar and the molasses distilled into <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum" title="Rum">rum</a>. The gold and credit slips were sent to England where they were exchanged for manufactures, which were shipped back to the colonies and sold along with the sugar and rum to farmers.</p>
<p>Other New England merchants took advantage of the rich fishing areas along the Atlantic Coast and financed a large fishing fleet, transporting its catch of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackerel" title="Mackerel">mackerel</a> and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod" title="Cod">cod</a> to the West Indies and Europe. Some merchants exploited the vast amounts of timber along the coasts and rivers of northern New England. They funded <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawmill" title="Sawmill">sawmills</a> that supplied cheap wood for houses and shipbuilding. Hundreds of New England shipwrights built oceangoing ships, which they sold to British and American merchants.</p>
<p>Many merchants became very wealthy by providing their goods to the agricultural population and ended up dominating the society of sea port cities. Unlike yeoman farmhouses, these merchants resembled the lifestyle of that of the upper class of England living in elegant <span class="frac nowrap">2<span class="visualhide">&#160;</span><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>-story houses designed the new Georgian style. These Georgian houses had a symmetrical façade with equal numbers of windows on both sides of the central door. The interior consisted of a passageway down the middle of the house with specialized rooms such as a library, dining room, formal parlor, and master bedroom off the sides. Unlike the multi-purpose space of the yeoman houses, each of these rooms served a separate purpose. In a Georgian house, men mainly used certain rooms, such as the library, while women mostly used the kitchen. These houses contained bedrooms on the second floor that provided privacy to parents and children.</p>

<p>Education was primarily the responsibility of families, but numerous religious groups, especially the Puritans in New England, established tax-supported elementary schools so their children could read the Bible. Nearly all the religious denominations set up their own schools and colleges to train ministers. Each city, and most towns, had private academies for the children of affluent families.<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102"><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The practical sciences were of great interest to colonial Americans, who were engaged in the process of taming and settling a wild frontier country. While science could eventually be applied to political problems, the mainstream of intellectual activity in the colonies was on technological and engineering developments rather than more abstract topics such as politics or metaphysics. American scientific activity was symbolized by <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rittenhouse" title="David Rittenhouse">David Rittenhouse</a>, who constructed the first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere, New York lieutenant governor <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadwallader_Colden" title="Cadwallader Colden">Cadwallader Colden</a>, botanist and anthropologist, and Dr. <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Rush" title="Benjamin Rush">Benjamin Rush</a>, the celebrated physician and social reformer and member of the American Philosophical Society founded by <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, who had contributed important discoveries to physics such as electricity, but was more successful in his practical inventions such as stoves and lightning rods.</p>
<p>The arts in colonial America were not as successful as the sciences. Literature in the European sense was nearly nonexistent, with histories being far more noteworthy. These included <i>The History and present State of Virginia</i> (1705) by <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Beverley,_Jr." title="Robert Beverley, Jr.">Robert Beverly</a> and <i>History of the Dividing Line</i> (1728–29) by <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Byrd" title="William Byrd">William Byrd</a>, which however was not published until a century later. Instead, the newspaper was the principal form of reading material in the colonies. Since printing was expensive, most publications focused on purely practical matters such as major news, advertisements, and business reports. Aside from newspapers, almanacs were very popular, Benjamin Franklin's <i>Poor Richard's Almanac</i> being the most famous. Literary magazines appeared at mid-century, but few were profitable and most went out of business after only a few years. While American publications never approached the intellectual quality of European writers, they were much more widespread and achieved a greater readership than anything produced by Voltaire, Locke, or Rousseau.</p>
<p>New Englanders wrote journals, pamphlets, books and especially sermons—more than all of the other colonies combined. <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Mather" title="Cotton Mather">Cotton Mather</a>, a Boston minister published <i><a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnalia_Christi_Americana" title="Magnalia Christi Americana">Magnalia Christi Americana</a></i> (The Great Works of Christ in America, 1702), while revivalist Jonathan Edwards wrote his philosophical work, <i>A Careful and Strict Enquiry Into...Notions of...Freedom of Will...</i> (1754). Most music had a religious theme as well and was mainly the singing of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalm" title="Psalm" class="mw-redirect">Psalms</a>. Because of New England's deep religious beliefs, artistic works that were insufficiently religious or too "worldly" were banned, especially the theater. The leading theologian and philosopher of the colonial era was <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)" title="Jonathan Edwards (theologian)">Jonathan Edwards</a> of Massachusetts, an interpreter of Calvinism, and the leader of the <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Great_Awakening" title="First Great Awakening">First Great Awakening</a>.</p>
<p>Art and drama were somewhat more successful than literature. <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_West" title="Benjamin West">Benjamin West</a> was a noteworthy painter of historical subjects and two first-rate portrait painters emerged in <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Singleton_Copley" title="John Singleton Copley">John Copley</a> and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Stuart" title="Gilbert Stuart">Gilbert Stuart</a>, yet all three men spent much of their lives in London. Theater was more developed in the Southern colonies, especially South Carolina, but nowhere did stage works attain the level of Europe. Puritans in New England and Quakers in Pennsylvania opposed theatrical performances as immoral and ungodly.</p>
<p>Elementary education was widespread in New England. Early Puritan settlers believed it was necessary to study the Bible, so children were taught to read at an early age. It was also required that each town pay for a primary school. About 10 percent enjoyed secondary schooling and funded <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar_school" title="Grammar school">grammar schools</a> in larger towns. Most boys learned skills from their fathers on the farm or as apprentices to artisans. Few girls attended formal schools, but most were able to get some education at home or at so-called "Dame schools" where women taught basic reading and writing skills in their own houses. By 1750, nearly 90% of New England's women and almost all of its men could read and write. Puritans founded <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College" title="Harvard College">Harvard College</a> in 1636 and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_College" title="Yale College">Yale College</a> in 1701.

The colleges were designed for aspiring ministers, lawyers or doctors. There were no departments or majors, as every student shared the same curriculum, which focused on Latin and Greek, mathematics, and history, philosophy, logic, ethics, rhetoric, oratory, and a little basic science. There were no sports or fraternities and few extracurricular activities apart from literary societies. There were no separate seminaries, law schools, or divinity schools. The first medical schools were founded late in the colonial era in Philadelphia and New York.<sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-103"><span>[</span>103<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Some migrants who came to Colonial America were in search of religious freedom.

Followers of Edwards and other preachers of similar religiosity called themselves the "New Lights", as contrasted with the "Old Lights", who disapproved of their movement.

<p>A similar pietistic revival movement took place among some German and Dutch settlers, leading to more divisions.

<p>Unlike New England, the Mid-Atlantic Region gained much of its population from new immigration, and by 1750, the combined populations of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>, <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> had reached nearly 300,000 people. By 1750, about 60,000 Irish and 50,000 <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_American" title="German American" class="mw-redirect">Germans</a> came to live in British North America, many of them settling in the Mid-Atlantic Region. <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Penn" title="William Penn">William Penn</a>, the man who founded the colony of Pennsylvania in 1682, attracted an influx of British Quakers with his policies of religious liberty and freehold ownership.

Many Germans came to escape the religious conflicts and declining economic opportunities in Germany and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Thousands of poor German farmers, chiefly from the Palatine region of Germany, migrated to upstate districts after 1700. They kept to themselves, married their own, spoke German, attended Lutheran churches, and retained their own customs and foods. They emphasized farm ownership. Some mastered English to become conversant with local legal and business opportunities. They ignored the Indians and tolerated slavery (although few were rich enough to own a slave).<sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-107"><span>[</span>107<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Much of the architecture of the Middle Colonies reflects the diversity of its peoples. In <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York" title="Albany, New York">Albany</a> and New York City, a majority of the buildings were Dutch style with brick exteriors and high gables at each end while many Dutch churches were shaped liked an octagon. Using cut stone to build their houses, German and Welsh settlers in Pennsylvania followed the way of their homeland and completely ignored the plethora of timber in the area. An example of this would be <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germantown,_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" class="mw-redirect">Germantown</a>, Pennsylvania where 80 percent of the buildings in the town were made entirely of stone. On the other hand, settlers from Ireland took advantage of America's ample supply of timber and constructed sturdy <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_cabin" title="Log cabin">log cabins</a>.</p>
<p>Ethnic cultures also affected the styles of furniture. Rural Quakers preferred simple designs in furnishings such as tables, chairs, chests and shunned elaborate decorations. However, some urban Quakers had much more elaborate furniture. The city of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> became a major center of furniture-making because of its massive wealth from Quaker and British merchants. Philadelphian cabinet makers built elegant desks and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highboy" title="Highboy" class="mw-redirect">highboys</a>. German artisans created intricate carved designs on their chests and other furniture with painted scenes of flowers and birds. German potters also crafted a large array of jugs, pots, and plates, of both elegant and traditional design.</p>
<p>There were ethnic differences in the treatment of women. Among Puritan settlers in New England, wives almost never worked in the fields with their husbands. In German communities in Pennsylvania, however, many women worked in fields and stables. German and Dutch immigrants granted women more control over property, which was not permitted in the local English law. Unlike English colonial wives, German and Dutch wives owned their own clothes and other items and were also given the ability to write wills disposing of the property brought into the marriage.</p>
<p>By the time of the Revolutionary War, approximately 85 percent of white Americans were of English, Irish, Welsh, or Scottish descent. Approximately 8.8 percent of whites were of German ancestry, and 3.5 percent were of Dutch origin.</p>

<p>Ethnicity made a difference in agricultural practice. As an example, German farmers generally preferred <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxen" title="Oxen" class="mw-redirect">oxen</a> rather than horses to pull their plows and Scots-Irish made a farming economy based on hogs and corn. Eventually cows were brought with the horses. They were more useful than horses for many reasons. Almost all the farms had cows on their land. In Ireland, people farmed intensively, working small pieces of land trying to get the largest possible production-rate from their crops. In the American colonies, settlers from northern Ireland focused on mixed-farming. Using this technique, they grew corn for human consumption and as feed for hogs and other livestock. Many improvement-minded farmers of all different backgrounds began using new agricultural practices to raise their output. During the 1750s, these agricultural innovators replaced the hand sickles and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythe" title="Scythe">scythes</a> used to harvest <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay" title="Hay">hay</a>, <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley" title="Barley">barley</a> with the cradle scythe, a tool with wooden fingers that arranged the stalks of grain for easy collection. This tool was able to triple the amount of work done by farmers in one day. Farmers also began fertilizing their fields with <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces" title="Feces">dung</a> and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_lime" title="Agricultural lime">lime</a> and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_rotation" title="Crop rotation">rotating their crops</a> to keep the soil fertile. By 1700, Philadelphia was exporting 350,000 bushels of wheat and 18,000 tons of flour annually. The Southern colonies in particular relied on cash crops such as tobacco and cotton. South Carolina produced rice and indigo. North Carolina was somewhat less involved in the plantation economy, but because a major producer of naval stores. Virginia and Maryland came to be almost totally dependent on tobacco, which would ultimately prove fatal at the end of the 18th century thanks to exhausted soil and collapsing prices, but for most of the century, the soil remained good and a single-crop economy profitable.</p>
<p>Before 1720, most colonists in the mid-Atlantic region worked with small-scale farming and paid for imported manufactures by supplying the West Indies with corn and flour. In New York, a fur-pelt export trade to Europe flourished adding additional wealth to the region. After 1720, mid-Atlantic farming stimulated with the international demand for wheat. A massive population explosion in Europe brought wheat prices up. By 1770, a bushel of wheat cost twice as much as it did in 1720. Farmers also expanded their production of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flax_seed" title="Flax seed" class="mw-redirect">flax seed</a> and corn since flax was a high demand in the Irish <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linen" title="Linen">linen</a> industry and a demand for corn existed in the West Indies. Thus, by mid-century, most colonial farming was a commercial venture, although subsistence agriculture continued to exist in New England and the middle colonies.</p>
<p>Some immigrants who just arrived purchased farms and shared in this export wealth, but many poor German and Irish immigrants were forced to work as agricultural wage laborers. Merchants and artisans also hired these homeless workers for a domestic system for the manufacture of <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloth" title="Cloth" class="mw-redirect">cloth</a> and other goods. Merchants often bought <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool" title="Wool">wool</a> and flax from farmers and employed newly arrived immigrants, who had been <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile" title="Textile">textile</a> workers in Ireland and Germany, to work in their homes spinning the materials into yarn and cloth. Large farmers and merchants became wealthy, while farmers with smaller farms and artisans only made enough for subsistence. The Mid-Atlantic region, by 1750, was divided by both ethnic background and wealth.</p>

<p>Seaports, which expanded from wheat trade, had more social classes than anywhere else in the Middle Colonies. By 1773, the population of Philadelphia had reached 40,000, New York 25,000, and <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore,_Maryland" title="Baltimore, Maryland" class="mw-redirect">Baltimore</a> 6,000.<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-108"><span>[</span>108<span>]</span></a></sup> Merchants dominated seaport society and about 40 merchants controlled half of Philadelphia's trade.

Wives and husbands often worked as a team and taught their children their crafts to pass it on through the family. Many of these artisans and traders made enough money to create a modest life.</p>
<p>Laborers stood at the bottom of seaport society. These poor people worked on the docks unloading inbound vessels and loading outbound vessels with wheat, corn, and flaxseed. Many of these were <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American" title="African American" class="mw-redirect">African American</a>; some were free while others were enslaved. In 1750, blacks made up about 10 percent of the population of New York and Philadelphia. Hundreds of seamen, some who were African American, worked as sailors on merchant ships.</p>

<p>The Southern Colonies were mainly dominated by the wealthy planters in Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina. They owned increasingly large plantations that were worked by African slaves. Of the 650,000 inhabitants of the South in 1750, about 250,000 or 40 percent, were slaves. The plantations grew tobacco, indigo and rice for export, and raised most of their own food supplies.<sup id="cite_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-109"><span>[</span>109<span>]</span></a></sup> In addition, many small subsistence farms were family owned and operated by <a href="/web/20160310121427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Folk_of_the_Old_South" title="Plain Folk of the Old South">yeoman</a>.

In 1650, estimates put Maryland's total population near six hundred with fewer than two hundred women present.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_114-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-114"><span>[</span>114<span>]</span></a></sup> Much of the population consisted of young, single, white indentured servants, and as such the colonies, to a large degree, lacked any social cohesiveness. African women entered the colony as early as 1619, although their status: free, slave or indentured servant remains a historical debate. In the 17th century high mortality rates for newcomers and a very high ratio of men to women made family life either impossible or unstable for most colonists. These factors, along with dispersed settlements and a reluctance to live in villages, together with a growing immigration of white indentured servants and black slaves made families and communities in the Virginia-Maryland region before 1700 fundamentally different from their counterparts in Europe and New England. These extreme conditions both demeaned and empowered women. Lacking male protectors, women, especially teenage girls who were indentured servants, often were vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. On the other hand, without parental oversight, young women had much more freedom in choosing spouses, and the shortage of eligible women enabled them to use marriage as an avenue to upward mobility. The high death rates meant that Chesapeake wives generally became widows who inherited property; many widows increased their property by remarrying as soon as possible. The population began to stabilize around 1700, with a 1704 census listing 30,437 white people present with 7,163 of those being women.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_114-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-114"><span>[</span>114<span>]</span></a></sup> Women married younger, remained wed longer, bore more children, and lost influence within the family polity.<sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115"><span>[</span>115<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

About Sir Edmund Andros
Sir Edmund Andros was an early colonial English governor in North America, most notably as the head of the Dominion of New England for most of its three-year existence.
He also governed at various times the provinces of New York, East and West Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland, and the isle of Guernsey.
His rule of Puritan New England was so unpopular, that when news of the Glorious Revolution reached Boston in 1689, he was arrested and sent back to England.
Despite being intensely disliked in New England, Andros was an effective governor in New York and Virginia, although, like many colonial governors, he made powerful local enemies who worked to remove him from office.
He negotiated the Covenant Chain with the Iroquois, establishing a long-lived peace involving the northern and middle colonies and a number of other Indian tribes.
His actions and governance generally followed the instructions he was given upon appointment to office, and he received approbation from the monarchs and governments that appointed him.

Sir Edmund Andros (1637-1714)
Royal Governor, Dominion of New England 1686-1689
As Governor of the Colony of New York, Edmund Andros improved the Colony's defenses and settled a boarder dispute.
He was knighted in 1681 and sent back to the American colonies as the Royal Governor of the Dominion of New England, which included New York and the Jerseys north to New Hampshire and Maine.
Not only would the rule of Andros be despised, but also it would end with him in chains.
The colonies had been politically drifting from England's control, and it was Andros' task to reassert England's will.
Andros attempted to consolidate his political power by forbidding town meetings, except for annual elections.
He prohibited citizens from leaving the country without his consent, hence restraining any complaints from being carried to the King.
Boston's Puritans were indignant when the right of marriage was removed from the clergy.
They were further incensed when he took use of the Old South Church for Anglican services until King's Chapel was constructed.
At the news of the accession of William and Mary, the Boston colonials rebelled.
Andros and his officials were held on Castle Island and then sent back to England as prisoners.
Andros was exonerated and went on to become Governor of Virginia (1692-98).
Former Governor Simon Bradstreet took over Massachusetts' leadership until the arrival of Sir William Phips in 1692.

<H2>Massachusetts</H2>
<P class="para1">The king's reaction to Bacon's Rebellion fit a larger pattern
of asserting more authority over America. New England, with its independent
ways, was an obvious target. Back in the mid-1660s royal commissioners had
visited Massachusetts and seen Dutch merchant vessels trading in Boston harbor
in violation of the <A href="navigationacts.htm">Navigation Acts</A>. Puritan
leaders were surly about the matter. &quot;The laws of England . . . do not
reach [to] America,&quot; they declared. Once back in England, the angry
commissioners urged the Crown to take over the colony, but nothing happenedâ€”at
least not for a few years.&nbsp;</P>
<P class="para2">Then in 1675 King Charles, seeking more effective control over
the colonies, designated certain Privy Council members to serve as the Lords of
Trade and Plantations. The lords, in turn, sent agents and customs officials to
America. The most notorious was Edward Randolph, a grim, dedicated bureaucrat
who never met a Puritan he liked. Soon he was bombarding the lords with negative
reports. In response to Randolph's accusations the lords began legal proceedings
and got the Bay Colony charter revoked in 1684.</P>
<P class="para2">Randolph was not solely responsible for voiding the charter.
The Lords of Trade had developed plans for setting up two or three large
administrative territories in North America. New England made a natural unit,
based on geographic cohesion and forms of economic production. Charles thought
the scheme too radical, but when James became king in 1685, the lords gained
permission to set up the Dominion of New England, which stretched from Nova
Scotia to the Delaware River.</P>
<P class="para2">James II liked the Dominion concept not only because it favored
the Church of England but also because it centralized political power in the
hands of a governor and a large advisory council made up of Crown appointees.
Local representative assemblies would likewise cease to exist. James gladly
wrote New York's local leaders and informed them that they would now exist under
the authority of the Dominion. As for Connecticut and Rhode Island, the lords
were working to void their charters in court.<BR>
</P>
<P class="para2">From the outset the <B>Dominion</B> was a bad idea, perhaps
made worse by naming as governor Sir Edmund Andros (1637-1714), a man of
aristocratic bearing with impressive military credentials. Among his councilors
was the despised Edward Randolph. Images of political tyranny wafted through
Puritan minds when Andros debarked in Boston in late 1686 and demanded that a
building be found for holding Anglican church services. It all smacked of
garrison government in which the highest ranking military officer had complete
authority, with no popular checks whatsoever.</P>
<P class="para2">Andros expected the Puritans to conform to the imperial will.
He announced plans to rewrite all land deeds, none of which the General Court
had awarded in the king's name and, then, to impose quitrents, which New
Englanders had never paid. He announced import taxes to underwrite the expenses
of his government, and he started prosecuting violators of the Navigation Acts.</P>
<P class="para2">Meanwhile, back in England, James II had created an uproar by
pushing royal authority too far. In defiance of England's Protestant tradition,
he flaunted his Roman Catholic beliefs and announced that his newborn son, now
next in line for the throne, would be raised a Catholic. The thought of yet more
turbulence over religious beliefs was too much for influential English leaders
to bear. In December 1688 they drove James from the realm and offered the throne
to his Protestant daughter, Mary, and her husband, the Dutch prince, William of
Orange, as joint monarchs. As part of the <A
href="/web/20160306191904/http://roebuckclasses.com/201/conquest/gloriousrevolution.htm">Glorious Revolution</A>, Parliament
also placed strict limitations on royal prerogatives by adopting the Declaration
of Rights (1689), which at long last assured Parliament an equal, if not
dominant, voice in Britain's political affairs.</P>
<P class="para2">When news of the Glorious Revolution reached Boston, local
Puritan leaders went into action.<B> They believed wild rumors about James, who
had fled to France, conspiring with Andros, French Canadians, and Indians to
seize New England and turn it into a new bastion of Roman Catholicism</B>. They
seized the governor on April 18, 1689, threw him in jail, and then shipped him
back to England. They did so, they insisted, to end Andros's arbitrary rule, and
they asked William and Mary to restore their original corporate charter.</P>

<H2>New York</H2>
<P class="para2">The coup in Massachusetts helped spark a rebellion in New York,
where a volatile mix of <B>ethnic</B> and <B>class tensions</B> resulted in a
violent upheaval. Francis Nicholson served in New York City as the Dominion's
lieutenant governor. Wealthy Dutch and English landholders and merchants
cooperated with his rule, which bred resentment among poorer Dutch and English
settlers, such as the Puritans on Long Island. Jacob Leisler, a combative local
merchant of German origin, also hated the favored families. They had snubbed him
socially, despite his marriage to a wealthy Dutch widow. Even worse, from his
point of view, they cared little about securing popular political rights.</P>
<P class="para2"><IMG border="0" src="/web/20160306191904im_/http://roebuckclasses.com/maps/usmap/immigrantongrtwagonroad.jpg"
width="893" height="615"></P>
<P class="para2">When reports of the rumored <B>&quot;popish&quot; plot </B>and
the Massachusetts coup reached New York, Leisler exhorted the anti-Nicholson
settlers to rise up and defend themselves. He organized 500 of them into a
military force, and on May 31 they captured Fort James which guarded New York
harbor. Within a few days, Nicholson fled to England. Leisler set up an interim
government and waited for advice from England, hoping that the new monarchs
would make a permanent grant of a popularly based assembly. In addition, Leisler
made no attempt to stop mobs from harassing and robbing wealthy families.</P>
<H2>Maryland</H2>
<P class="para2">The third colony jolted by a revolt in 1689 was Maryland, where
quarrels between Roman Catholics and Protestants remained a perpetual source of
tension. The proprietary governor, William Joseph, tried to contain the popish
conspiracy rumors, but John Coode, an anxious local planter, organized the
Protestant Association to defend Marylanders from the impending slaughter.
Rumormongers soon were whispering that the Catholic proprietor and his local
governor were in on the plot. That was all Coode needed. He led 250 followers to
St. Mary's, where in July 1689 they removed Joseph from office, called their own
assembly, and then sent representatives to England to plead for royal
government.</P>
<P class="para2">In a chain reaction, three political uprisings had occurred in
the American colonies in just four months. Although each had its own individual
character, the common issue, besides the rumored Catholic conspiracy, was the
question of how extensive colonial rights would be in the face of tightening
imperial administration. All the colonists could do now was wait to hear from
the new monarchsâ€”and hope for the best.</P>

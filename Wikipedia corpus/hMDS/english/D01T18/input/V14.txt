FACTS
The                      Roman fort on which the castle is built, is called Verteris.

Dating                from 1090, this is another castle built upon the ruins of a Roman                fort.
Constructed by William Rufus when the land was annexed from the                Scots, it stood as defence to the English lands until 1136.
Then                both Brough Castle and Appleby Castle were taken by the Scots, and                held until 1157, when they were retaken by the English.
Sometime                during 1173/4 the castle was besieged by the Scottish king, William                the Lion.
After valiant efforts by the six knights and their followers,                the castle was surrendered.
Then much of it was destroyed by the                Scottish army, except for the outer walls and the base of the keep.
The                    Keep at Brough Castle
Some                restoration work was carried out on the castle, between 1179 and                1190, by Theobold de Valoines.
However it wasn't until 1203, when                the castle was given over to Robert de Vipont by John I, that any                major works were carried out.
Vipont                refortified the castle and built the gatehouse too, as well as repairing                the keep and curtain walls.
He also added a hall across the courtyard.
In                1269 the castle passed into the Clifford family.
They added a tower,                known as Cliffords Tower and a new hall.
The                Castle remained the preferred home of the Cliffords until 1521,                when it was destroyed by a great fire during the Christmas feasts.
It                remained in a state of disrepair until 1661 when Lady Anne Clifford                took an interest, as she did with Brougham and Appleby, and started                restoration works on the castle.
In 1663 a plaque was erected in                the castle to commemorate Lady Anne's efforts in the restoration.
After                her death in 1679, the castle passed to her grandson, Thomas Tufton.
He started the demolition of the castle, taking stone to repair                the castle at Appleby, and soon after this the roofs and fittings                were sold off and the stone used to repair local buildings.
Even                Lady Anne's commemorative plaque was taken and used beneath the                watermill at Brough.
The                castle was passed to the Ministry of Works in 1920, and it was only                just saved it from total collapse.
The castle is now cared for by                English Heritage.

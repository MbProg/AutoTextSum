<p>Welcome to Historic UK's interactive map of castles in England. From the smaller motte and bailey earthworks to the world famous Leeds Castle, all have been geotagged onto the Google Map below. We have also included a short synopsis of each of the castles, including the history behind them and who they are now owned by.</p>
<p>To get the most out of our interactive map, please select the 'Satellite' option below; which in our opinion, allows you to more fully appreciate the castle and its defences from above.</p>
<p>Although we have attempted to create the most comprehensive listing on the internet, there is a small chance that a few castles may have slipped through our net. If you've noticed any ommissions, please do not hesitate to fill out the form at the bottom of the map.</p>

Built between 1284-1293 by Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, friend and advisor to King Edward I, the location of the manor house was important, close to the old Roman road of Watling Street. The influence of Bishop Burnell was such that this little Shropshire village twice hosted the English Parliament, first in 1283 and again in 1285. All that remains open to the public is the shell of the former private residence. Free open access at any reasonable time.	');
newpoints[1] = new Array(	55.41575,-1.70607, icon1, '	Alnwick Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Alnwick Castle,	Alnwick, Northumberland	<p>Owned by: 	Duke of Northumberland	 <p><img  src="/assets/Images/englandcastlealnwick.jpg?1369043085" width="101" height="101" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"/ />	Medieval castle and stately home.	Built following the Norman conquest and renovated and remodelled many times since then, it is the great northern fortress of the powerful Percy family, the Dukes of Northumberland. Insid, the rooms have also been remodelled over the centuries, most notably by the famous Robert Adam in the 18th century. Most famously in recent years, Alnwick Castle featured as &#39;Hogwarts&#39; in the first two Harry Potter films. Entrance charges apply to both castle and gardens.	');
newpoints[2] = new Array(	54.57423,-2.48878, icon1, '	Appleby Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Appleby Castle,	Appleby-in-Westmorland, Cumbria	<p>Owned by: 	Privately owned	<p>Intact Norman Castle and mansion house.	Standing guard over the Eden Valley since Norman times, the castle was once owned by the Kings of England. Built when King William II took Westmorland from the Scots, the great castle keep, known as Caesar&#39;s Tower dates from around 1170. Now a private residence it is not open to the public.	');
newpoints[3] = new Array(	50.856111,-0.553611, icon1, '	Arundel Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Arundel Castle,	Arundel, West Sussex	<p>Owned by: 	Arundel Castle Trust	 <p><img  src="/assets/Images/englandcastlearundel.jpg?1369043622" width="101" height="101" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"/ />	Restored medieval castle. Founded by Roger de Montgomery in 1067, the castle was damaged during the English Civil War and restored throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The castle has been the hereditary stately home of the Duke of Norfolk for over 400 years, and remains the principal seat of the Norfolk family. Most of the castle and grounds are open to the public; entrance charges apply to both the castle and gardens.	');

Founded by the Norman noble Alain de Parrhoet, la Zouch, this fortified manor house dates from the 12th century and was extended by his descendants over the next three centuries. During the English Civil War the castle was subject to a prolonged siege between September 1645 and its surrender in March 1646. The surrender terms demanded that the castle be slighted (demolished). Visitors can still climb the tower and discover the underground passage from the kitchen to the tower. Entrance charges apply.	');
newpoints[5] = new Array(	54.991376,-1.999475, icon1, '	Aydon Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Aydon Castle,	Aydon, Nr Corbridge, Northumberland	<p>Owned by: 	English Heritage	<p><img  src="/assets/Images/englandcastleaydon.jpg?1369043602" width="101" height="101" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"/ />	Intact 13th century English manor house.	Originally built as an undefended manor house, it was  fortified on the outbreak of Anglo-Scottish Wars. It was captured by the Scots in 1315, seized by English rebels two years later, and again occupied by Scots in 1346. Recently restored to its medieval appearance, entrance charges apply.	');
newpoints[6] = new Array(	52.8991,1.1521, icon1, '	Baconsthorpe Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Baconsthorpe Castle,	Nr Holt, Norfolk	<p>Owned by: 	English Heritage	<p><img  src="/assets/Images/aldborough.jpg?1361466628" width="101" height="101" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"/ />	Ruined moated and fortified 15th century manor house.	Built by the ambitious Heydon family between 1460-1486 as a simple manor house, it was later fortified and enlarged as the family&#39;s wealth grew. After the English Civil War the house fell into ruin. Free open access at any reasonable time.	');
newpoints[7] = new Array(	55.609063,-1.7102, icon1, '	Bamburgh Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Bamburgh Castle,	Bamburgh, Northumberland	<p>Owned by: 	Armstrong family	<p>Intact and inhabited Norman castle. Once the Royal Seat of the Kings of Northumbria, the first written reference to the castle dates from AD 547, when it was captured by the Anglo-Saxon ruler Ida of Bernicia. Vikings destroyed the original fortification in AD 993. The Normans built a new castle on the site, which forms the core of the current structure. Open to the public, entrance charges apply.	');
newpoints[8] = new Array(	54.543599,-1.926654, icon1, '	Barnard Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Barnard Castle,	Barnard Castle, County Durham	<p>Owned by: 	English Heritage	<p><img  src="/assets/Images/englandcastlebarnard.jpg?1369043479" width="101" height="101" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"/ />	Remains of medieval castle.	Founded by the Normans shortly after the conquest, the castle enjoyed its heyday under Bernard de Bailliol during the latter half of the 12th century. The castle passed into the possession of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, and then to King Richard III, falling into ruins in the century after his death. Entrance charges apply.	');
newpoints[9] = new Array(	52.13539,-0.46333, icon1, '	Bedford Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Bedford Castle,	Bedford, Bedfordshire	<p>Owned by: 	Scheduled Ancient Monument	<p>Remains of medieval castle.	Built sometime after 1100 by King Henry I, the castle played a significant role in both the civil war known as The Anarchy, and the First Barons&#39; War. Henry III besieged the castle in 1224, which lasted eight weeks. Following its surrender, the king ordered the castle&#39;s destruction. Today only part of the motte can be seen, forming part of an archaeological park.	');
newpoints[10] = new Array(	53.1277,-2.6913, icon1, '	Beeston Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Beeston Castle,	Beeston, Tarporley, Cheshire	<p>Owned by: 	English Heritage	<p>Ruined remains of a 13th century castle.	Standing on a rocky crag high above the Cheshire Plain, Beeston Castle was built in the 1220s by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, on his return from the Crusades. The castle remained in good repair until the 16th century, when it was considered to be of no further strategic importance. It was partly demolished in 1646, in accordance with Cromwell&#39;s destruction order, to prevent its further use as a stronghold. Treasure belonging to Richard II is rumoured to be hidden in the castle grounds. Restricted opening times and entrance charges apply.	');
newpoints[11] = new Array(	54.961551,-2.470503, icon1, '	Bellister Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Bellister Castle,	Haltwhistle, Northumberland	<p>Owned by: 	National Trust	<p>	Remains of a 19th century mansion house attached to the ruins of a 14th century tower house. This ruined castellated 19th century mansion house and remains of a 14th century tower house stand on what may have been an earlier motte and bailey castle. The mansion house suffered serious fire damage in 1901, whilst the older remains were allowed to fall into decay. Although owned by the National Trust, the structures are not open to the public; the castle exterior however, can be viewed from adjacent properties.	');
newpoints[12] = new Array(	55.101279,-1.868562, icon1, '	Belsay Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Belsay Castle,	Belsay, Northumberland	<p>Owned by: 	English Heritage	<p>Remains of medieval castle.	This substantial, three story rectangular pele tower with turrets and battlements was constructed around 1370. Home to the Middleton family, a new manor house was added to the tower in 1614. The castle was abandoned by the family in the early 19th century. Restricted opening times and entrance charges apply.	');
newpoints[13] = new Array(	51.688561,-2.4568, icon1, '	Berkeley Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Berkeley Castle,	Berkeley, Gloucestershire	<p>Owned by: 	Berkeley Castle Charitable Trust	<p><img  src="/assets/Images/englandcastleberkeley.jpg?1369043103" width="101" height="101" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"/ />	The oldest continuously-occupied castle in England after the royal residences. The first castle at Berkeley was a Norman motte-and-bailey structure, built around 1067, shortly after the Conquest. The present castle has remained within the Berkeley family since they reconstructed it in the 12th century. It is believed to be the scene of the murder of King Edward II in 1327. Restricted opening times from Easter to October, entrance charges apply.	');
newpoints[14] = new Array(	51.764002,-0.559918, icon1, '	Berkhamsted Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Berkhamsted Castle,	Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire	<p>Owned by: 	English Heritage	<p><img  src="/assets/Images/englandcastleberkhamsted.jpg?1369043550" width="101" height="101" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"/ />	Remains of an 11th - 13th century motte and bailey stronghold. Built during the Norman Conquest of England to control a key route between London and the Midlands, the motte and bailey castle was surrounded by protective earthworks. Extended in the mid-12th century, the castle was besieged in 1216 during the civil war between King John and rebel barons. Subsequently used to hold royal prisoners, it was described as being in ruins by the middle of the 16th century. Free open access at any reasonable time.	');
newpoints[15] = new Array(	50.449027,-3.636669, icon1, '	Berry Pomeroy Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Berry Pomeroy Castle,	Totnes, Devon	<p>Owned by: 	English Heritage	<p><img  src="/assets/Images/englandcastleberrypomeroy.jpg?1369043527" width="101" height="101" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"/ />	Remains of a Tudor mansion within the walls of an earlier castle.	Within the 15th century defences of the Pomeroy family castle stands the ruined shell of a great Elizabethan mansion. Intended to become the most spectacular house in Devon, Sir Edward Seymour started building his new four-storey house in 1560. Enlarged by his son from 1600, it was never completed and abandoned by 1700. It is reputed to be one of the most haunted castles in Britain. Restricted opening times and entrance charges apply.	');
newpoints[16] = new Array(	55.775,-2.013, icon1, '	Berwick Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Berwick Castle,	Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland	<p>Owned by: 	English Heritage	<p><img  src="/assets/Images/englandcastleberwick.jpg?1369043756" width="101" height="101" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"/ />	Remains of a medieval castle and the most complete bastioned town defences in England.	Built in the 12th century by the Scottish King David I, the English King Edward I had the castle rebuilt and added the substantial town walls of Berwick. Both the town and castle changed hands several times over the centuries that followed, as a result of the Anglo-Scottish conflicts. The construction of modern ramparts around the town in the 16th century rendered the castle obsolete and much of the remaining structure was demolished when the town&#39;s railway station was built. Some of the 13th century castle and the extensive town walls survive. Free open access at any reasonable time.	');
newpoints[17] = new Array(	52.086414,-0.272889, icon1, '	Biggleswade Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Biggleswade Castle,	Biggleswade, Bedfordshire	<p>Owned by: 	Scheduled Ancient Monument	<p><img  src="/assets/Images/englandcastlemottebailey.jpg?1369048649" width="101" height="101" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"/ />	Slight earthwork evidence of motte and bailey castle. Only discovered in 1954, when an aerial photography revealed the shape of this motte and bailey castle dating from around 1144. Little visible evidence remains. 	');
newpoints[18] = new Array(	54.974,-2.525, icon1, '	Blenkinsop Castle	', '<p style="font-weight:bold;">	Blenkinsop Castle,	Greenhead, Northumberland	<p>Owned by: 	Scheduled Ancient Monument	<p>	Remains of a 14th century pele tower. Remains of a 14th century pele tower within a demolished 19th-century country mansion. Originally home to the Blenkinsop family, the White Lady spectre is said to still wander the ruins.

Orford is built to a keep and bailey plan, with a strong central keep surrounded by a curtain wall. The outer curtain wall has all but disappeared; the central tower keep however, is very much intact and stands tall beside the pretty town and former port which Henry II also developed here.

The Normans needed to establish control over the settlement and demonstrate their dominance; hence the Tower of London was begun. Integrating the existing Roman town walls into its structure, the earliest phase would have been enclosed by a ditch and defended by a timber palisade, with accommodation for William. Most of the early Norman castles were constructed in wood, but by the end of the 11th century many had been rebuilt using stone. Started in 1087, the White Tower was the earliest stone keep to be built in England. Around 1240, Henry III made the Tower his home, whitewashing the walls, extending the grounds and adding a great hall; the Normans called it La Tour Blanche, or the White Tower.

<p><strong>Tower of London, London, Greater London</strong><br /><em>Owned by: Historic Royal Palaces</em><br />Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress. Victorious at the Battle of Hastings on 14th October 1066, the invading William the Conqueror spent the rest of the year fortifying key strategic positions across southern England. At the time, London was the largest town in England and centre of governance with a prosperous port. The Normans needed to establish control over the settlement and demonstrate their dominance; hence the Tower of London was begun. Integrating the existing Roman town walls into its structure, the earliest phase would have been enclosed by a ditch and defended by a timber palisade, with accommodation for William. Most of the early Norman castles were constructed in wood, but by the end of the 11th century many had been rebuilt using stone. Started in 1087, the White Tower was the earliest stone keep to be built in England. Around 1240, Henry III made the Tower his home, whitewashing the walls, extending the grounds and adding a great hall; the Normans called it La Tour Blanche, or the White Tower. Since then the tower has been used as a home for kings and queens, a royal mint, treasury, prison and royal zoo. Today it houses the Crown Jewels and the Royal Ravens.

<p><strong>Warwick Castle, Warwick, Warwickshire</strong><br /><em>Owned by: Tussauds Group</em><br />Impressive remains of large medieval castle. Built shortly after after the Norman Conquest of England in 1068, initially as a motte and bailey type fortification, an earthen mound topped by a wooden palisade. Normally constructed to control strategic points and approaches, this castle occupies a loop of the River Avon. The original wooden castle was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century and fortified further during the Hundred Years War. In 1604 James I granted the castle to Sir Fulke Greville, who lavished vast sums of money on modernising the castle and to create a comfortable country house from the crumbling ruins of the medieval fortress. It was owned by the Greville family until 1978 when it was bought by the Tussauds Group. Restricted opening times and entrance charges apply.</p>

<p><strong>Weeting Castle, Weeting, Norfolk</strong><br /><em>Owned by: English Heritage</em><br />Remains of early medieval moated manor house. Despite the name, Weeting is not a castle but a manor house built in the 12th century by the De Plaiz family. Rather than for defence, the rectangular moat that surrounds the building was added in the mid-13th century to demonstrate the wealth and power of the family. It is believed to have been abandoned from 1390. Free and open access at any reasonable time.</p>

<p><strong>Westenhanger Castle, Hythe, Kent</strong><br /><em>Owned by: Forge Family</em><br />Partially renovated fortified manor house. The de Criol family were responsible for building the fortified manor house on the site in 1343, and it remained with the family until the War of the Roses when Sir Thomas de Criol was beheaded. Strengthened in response to threats of attack from France during the 14th century, in 1588 Queen Elizabeth used the castle as the command centre for troops who were to defend the south coast from the Spanish Armada. By the mid-17th century it was one of the largest houses in Kent, however shortly after this it started to fall in to disrepair. Recent renovation work is attempting to reverse the decades of neglect. Opened for pre-booked group visits only.</p>

<p><strong>Whittington Castle, Whittington, Shropshire</strong><br /><em>Owned by: Whittington Castle Preservation Fund</em><br />Remains of extensive Medieval Marches castle . The original Norman motte-and-bailey fortification was rebuilt in the 13th century, including the stone curtain wall, inner bailey and outer gatehouse with its 42 foot long drawbridge. As a castle of the Welsh Marches, it was built on the border of Wales and England and provided excellent views towards Offa's Dyke over which Welsh raiders frequently invaded. Although added to and improved in the mid-14th century, the castle gradually fell into disrepair so that by 1392 it was declared to be 'utterly in ruins'. Whittington Castle is currently owned by the Whittington Castle Preservation Trust, a local rural community. Free and open access at restricted times and dates. There is free and open access all year round to the castle grounds.</p>

<p><strong>Wigmore Castle, Wigmore, Herefordshire</strong><br /><em>Owned by: English Heritage</em><br />Remains of extensive Medieval Marches castle. Built shortly after the Norman Conquest of England around 1070, initially as a motte and bailey type fortification, an earthen mound topped by a wooden palisade. Normally constructed to control strategic points and approaches, the castle lies almost halfway between the rivers Teme and Lugg, commanding the wide area between them. Under the ownership of the powerful Mortimer family the original wooden castle was rebuilt in stone in the late 12th century and further added to throughout the 13th century, thus creating one of the most important and striking medieval fortresses in the Welsh Marches. In the years that followed, conflict in the troubled border areas calmed, eventually rendering such fortresses obsolete and when the Mortimer family moved their administrative centre from Wigmore to Ludlow, the castle was effectively redundant. Slighted during the English Civil War, the castle fell into decay and eventual ruin. Free and open access at any reasonable time.</p>

<p><strong>Wilton Castle, Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire</strong><br /><em>Owned by: Mr and Mrs Parslow</em><br />Remains of 12th century castle and 16th century manor house. Built shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, initially as a motte and bailey type fortification, an earthen mound topped by a wooden palisade. Normally constructed to control strategic points and approaches, the castle guards the point at which the road between England and Wales crosses the River Wye. During the 12th century, under the ownership of the powerful de Longchamps family, the original wooden castle was rebuilt using local sandstone. By the 16th century the military importance of Wilton had diminished, and when a more comfortable residence was required, a new manor house was built into the fabric of the castle recycling stone from the old walls. In 1645 during the English Civil War, the then owner Sir John Brydges refused to support either side; this so outraged local Royalists that one Sunday morning whilst he was attending church, they burned the house down. A more modern manor was built in the 19th century, which remains a residence today. Restricted summer open days and entrance charges apply.</p>

<p><strong>Winchester Castle, Winchester, Hampshire</strong><br /><em>Owned by: Hampshire County Council</em><br />Intact medieval hall and castle remains. Built in 1067 just a year after the Norman Conquest of England, it was one of the grandest fortresses in England and initially served as the main seat of government before that was transferred to London. Rebuilt in stone and flint by Henry III, the royal apartments were further extended by Edward II. Little remains from that early period, as after the English Civil War in 1646 Oliver Cromwell ordered its destruction. Today, only Henry III's Great Hall survives intact, attached to which is a small museum detailing the history of Winchester. Free and open access at any reasonable time.</p>

<p><strong>Windsor Castle, Windsor, Berkshire</strong><br /><em>Owned by: Royal Collection Trust</em><br />Intact and occupied Royal Palace. Now the largest inhabited castle in the world and the oldest in continuous occupation, Windsor was originally built by William the Conqueror to secure Norman dominance around London, and to oversee a strategically important part of the River Thames. The typical earth and wood motte and bailey structure was gradually replaced with stone fortifications. In 1175 Henry II strengthened the defences and added the first royal apartments; he even planted a vineyard. Over the centuries, almost every king and queen of England has lavished funds on Windsor, adding to and rebuilding this now luxurious royal palace. Restricted opening times and entrance charges apply.</p>

<p><strong>Wolvesey Castle, Winchester, Hampshire</strong><br /><em>Owned by: English Heritage</em><br />Ruins of 12th-century bishops palace. Built by the Bishop of Winchester Henry of Blois between 1130 and 1140, the early Norman keep and bailey castle was quickly extended and further fortified during the Civil War between Queen Matilda and King Stephen, known as The Anarchy. Once a very important building, in July 1554 it hosted the wedding breakfast of Queen Mary and Philip II of Spain before they left for the wedding ceremony at nearby Winchester Cathedral. Destroyed by the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War in 1646, the chapel is the only considerable remnant of the original castle. The chapel and castle remains were incorporated into the 'new' bishop's palace which was built in 1684. Free and open access at any reasonable time during summer months.</p>

<p><strong>Yarmouth Castle, Yarmouth, Isle of Wight</strong><br /><em>Owned by: English Heritage</em><br />Well preserved Tudor coastal artillery fortress. Built by Henry VIII as part of a chain of defences to protect England's coast from foreign invasion, following his decision to break from the Catholic Church, the fortress' defences represented the most advanced military architecture of the time. Constructed to guard the entrance to Yarmouth's harbour from the Solent, it was finished in 1547, one of the last castles to be built in Henry's ambitious plan and the first to adopt the new 'arrowhead' artillery bastion design. Restricted opening times and entrance charges apply.</p>

<p><strong>Yielden Castle, Yielden, Bedfordshire</strong><br /><em>Owned by: Scheduled Ancient Monument</em><br />Earthwork and remains of a motte and bailey castle. Built sometime after the Norman Conquest of England, as an earth and timber motte and bailey type fortification with two baileys. First recorded in 1173, it was the stronghold of the Trailly family until the 13th century, who may have been responsible for adding the stone curtain wall and round stone tower that once stood atop the motte. The castle appears to have fallen into ruin by 1360, possibly after suffering a siege. Only an earthwork mound and some remains are visible.</p>

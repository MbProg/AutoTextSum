California Gold Rush
 
Summary and Definition of California Gold Rush
Definition and Summary: The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) started on January 24, 1848 and attracted 300,000 prospectors when gold was discovered by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Lumber Mill in Coloma, California. The prospectors and gold seekers were called "forty-niners" or the "49ers" as the majority of them reached the location of the goldfields in 1849 in search of instant wealth and riches beyond their wildest dreams. In one year alone (1852) the take was $80 million, equivalent to nearly $2 billion in modern dollar currency.

The California Gold Rush started with the discovery of gold by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Lumber Mill in Coloma, California on January 24, 1848. The discovery of gold in California was therefore made before Mexico formally ceded territories to the United States, including California, under the terms of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican-American War (April 25, 1846 - February 2, 1848).

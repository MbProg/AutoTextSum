I didn't believe in fairies until my daughter came home from her trip to Avebury, England, and we saw a picture taken by her friend showing a fairy dancing on my daughter's head, and one slightly off to the side standing on a leaf.
My daughter was playing her flute in the lotus position in a sacred grove.
I believe now!
They really DO exist, but not always to the naked eye.
This book just fueled my interest more and is a well-written account of a historical event.

4.0 out of 5 stars They are real!
By Nicole B. on December 3, 2010
Format: Paperback Verified Purchase
I didn't believe in fairies until my daughter came home from her trip to Avebury, England, and we saw a picture taken by her friend showing a fairy dancing on my daughter's head, and one slightly off to the side standing on a leaf. My daughter was playing her flute in the lotus position in a sacred grove. I believe now! They really DO exist, but not always to the naked eye.
This book just fueled my interest more and is a well-written account of a historical event.

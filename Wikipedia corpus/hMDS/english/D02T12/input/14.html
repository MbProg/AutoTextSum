						<p align="justify"><b><span class="mw-headline">Early 
						life</span></b></p>
						<p align="justify">The details of Bellingham's early 
						life are unclear, as few sources survive, and most post-assassination 
						biographies of him included speculation as fact. 
						Recollections of family and friends allow some details 
						to be stated with confidence. Bellingham was certainly 
						born in St Neots, Huntingdonshire, and later brought up 
						in London, where he was apprenticed to a jeweller, James 
						Love, at the age of fourteen. </p>
						<p align="justify">Two years later, he was sent as a 
						midshipman on the maiden voyage of the <i>Hartwell</i> 
						from Gravesend to China. There was a mutiny on board on 
						May 22, 1787, which led to the ship running aground and 
						sinking.</p>
						<p align="justify">In 1794, a John Bellingham opened a 
						tin factory on London's Oxford Street, but the business 
						failed and he was declared bankrupt that March. It has 
						not been definitely established that this is the same 
						person. </p>
						<p align="justify">Bellingham certainly worked as a 
						clerk in a counting house in the late 1790s, and around 
						1800 he went to Archangel in Russia as an agent for 
						importers and exporters. </p>
						<p align="justify">He returned to England in 1802, and 
						worked in Liverpool as a merchant broker. He married 
						Mary Neville in 1803. In the summer of 1804, Bellingham 
						again went to Archangel to work for a short time as an 
						export representative.</p>
						<p align="justify"><b><span class="mw-headline">Russian 
						imprisonment</span></b></p>
						<p align="justify">In autumn 1803, a Russian ship <i>
						Soleure</i> insured at Lloyd's of London was lost in the 
						White Sea. The owners (the house of R. Van Brienen) 
						attempted to claim on their insurance but an anonymous 
						letter informed Lloyd's that the ship had been sabotaged. 
						Soloman Van Brienen suspected Bellingham was the author, 
						and decided to retaliate by accusing him of a debt of 
						4,890 roubles to a bankrupt for which he was an assignee.
						</p>
						<p align="justify">Bellingham, on the verge of leaving 
						for Britain on November 16, 1804, had his travelling 
						pass withdrawn because of the debt.</p>
						<p align="justify">Van Brienen also persuaded the 
						Governor-General of the area to imprison Bellingham. A 
						year later Bellingham secured his release and managed to 
						get to St. Petersburg, where he attempted to impeach the 
						Governor-General. </p>
						<p align="justify">This provoked the Russian authorities 
						and he was charged with leaving Archangel in a 
						clandestine manner, and again imprisoned. He was in 
						prison until October 1808 when he was put out onto the 
						streets, but without permission to leave. In his 
						desperation he personally petitioned the Tsar. He was 
						permitted to leave in 1809 and arrived back in England 
						in December.</p>
						<p align="justify"><b><span class="mw-headline">
						Assassination of the Prime Minister</span></b></p>
						<p align="justify">Back in England Bellingham began to 
						petition the United Kingdom Government for compensation 
						for his imprisonment, but was refused (the United 
						Kingdom had broken off diplomatic relations with Russia 
						in November 1808). His wife tried to persuade him to 
						drop the issue and Bellingham went back into work.</p>
						<p align="justify">In 1812 Bellingham again went to work 
						in London, where he renewed his attempts to win 
						compensation. On April 18 he went in person to the 
						offices of the Foreign Office where a civil servant 
						called Hill told him he was at liberty to take whatever 
						measures he thought proper. </p>
						<p align="justify">Bellingham had already started 
						preparations for resolving the matter in another way, 
						and on April 20 he bought two half-inch calibre (12.7 mm) 
						pistols from W. Beckwith, gunsmith of 58 Skinner Street. 
						He also arranged with a tailor to have a secret inside 
						pocket put on his coat. Around this time, he was often 
						seen in the lobby of the House of Commons.</p>
						<p align="justify">After taking the family of a friend 
						to see a water-colour painting exhibition on May 11, 
						1812, Bellingham casually remarked that he had some 
						business to attend to, and made his way to Parliament.
						</p>
						<p align="justify">He waited in the lobby until the 
						Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval appeared, then stepped 
						forward and shot him through the heart. Bellingham then 
						calmly sat on a bench. He was immediately detained by 
						those present and identified by Isaac Gascoyne, MP for 
						Liverpool.</p>
						<p align="justify">Bellingham was tried on Wednesday May 
						13 at the Old Bailey where he argued that he would have 
						preferred to kill the British Ambassador to Russia, but 
						that he was entitled as a wronged man to kill the 
						representative of those he saw as his oppressors. He 
						gave a formal statement to the court, saying:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p align="justify">&quot;Recollect, Gentlemen, what was 
							my situation. Recollect that my family was ruined 
							and myself destroyed, merely because it was Mr 
							Perceval's pleasure that justice should not be 
							granted; sheltering himself behind the imagined 
							security of his station, and trampling upon law and 
							right in the belief that no retribution could reach 
							him. I demand only my right, and not a favour; I 
							demand what is the birthright and privilege of every 
							Englishman. Gentlemen, when a minister sets himself 
							above the laws, as Mr Perceval did, he does it as 
							his own personal risk. If this were not so, the mere 
							will of the minister would become the law, and what 
							would then become of your liberties? I trust that 
							this serious lesson will operate as a warning to all 
							future ministers, and that they will henceforth do 
							the thing that is right, for if the upper ranks of 
							society are permitted to act wrong with impunity, 
							the inferior ramifications will soon become wholly 
							corrupted. Gentlemen, my life is in your hands, I 
							rely confidently in your justice.&quot;</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p align="justify">Evidence that Bellingham was insane 
                        was put forward by witnesses, but not by Bellingham 
                        himself, and was discounted by the trial judge, Sir 
                        James Mansfield. Bellingham was found guilty and his 
                        sentence was handed down:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">&quot;That you be taken from hence to the place from 
          whence you came, and from thence to a place of execution, where you 
          shall be hanged by the neck until you be dead; your body to be 
          dissected and anatomized.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="justify">The hanging was carried out in public on Monday, 18 
        May. According to René Martin Pillet, a Frenchman who wrote an account 
        of his ten years in England, the sentiment of the very large crowd that 
        gathered at Bellingham's execution was:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">&quot;Farewell poor man, you owe satisfaction to the 
          offended laws of your country, but God bless you! you have rendered an 
          important service to your country, you have taught ministers that they 
          should do justice, and grant audience when it is asked of them.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="justify">A subscription was raised for the widow and children 
        of Bellingham, and &quot;their fortune was ten times greater than they could 
        ever have expected in any other circumstances&quot;.</p>

        </font><b></p>
		<p align="justify"><i><style="font-size: 8pt">Executed for the Murder of the 
		Right Honourable Spencer Perceval, Chancellor of the Exchequer, by 
		shooting him in the House of Commons, in May, 1812</font></p>
		</i></b>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">ON the 11th of May, in the year 1812, 
		an event occurred which excited deep regret in the minds of the whole of 
		the British public -- the death of the Right Honourable Spencer Perceval, 
		then Chancellor of the Exchequer, by the hand of an assassin.</p>
		<p align="justify">John Bellingham, the author of this crime, was 
		brought up in a counting-house in London, and afterwards went to 
		Archangel, where he lived during a period of three years in the service 
		of a Russian merchant. Having returned to England, he was married to a 
		Miss Nevill, the daughter of a respectable merchant and shipbroker, who 
		at that time resided at Newry, but who subsequently removed to Dublin.</p>
		<p align="justify">Bellingham, being a person of active habits and of 
		considerable intelligence, was subsequently employed by some merchants 
		in the Russian trade, by whom he was induced again to visit Archangel, 
		and he in consequence proceeded thither, accompanied by his wife, in the 
		year 1804. His principal dealings were with the firm of Dorbecker &amp; Co.; 
		but before twelve months had expired a misunderstanding arose between 
		them, and each party made pecuniary claims upon the other. The subject 
		was referred by the Governor-General to the decision of four merchants, 
		two of whom Bellingham was allowed to select from his countrymen 
		resident on the spot, and by the award of these arbitrators Bellingham 
		was found to be indebted to the house of Dorbecker &amp; Co. in the sum of 
		two thousand roubles; but this sum he refused to pay, and appealed to 
		the Senate against the decision.</p>
		<p align="justify">In the meantime a criminal suit had been instituted 
		against him by the owners of a Russian ship which had been lost in the 
		White Sea. They accused him of having written an anonymous letter to the 
		underwriters in London, stating that the insurances of that ship were 
		fraudulent transactions; in consequence of which the payment for her 
		loss was resisted. No satisfactory proof being adduced, Bellingham was 
		acquitted; but before the termination of the suit he attempted to quit 
		Archangel, and being stopped by the police, whom he resisted, he was 
		taken to prison, but was soon after liberated, through the influence of 
		the British consul, Sir Stephen Sharp, to whom he had made application, 
		requesting to be protected from what he considered the injustice of the 
		Russian authorities.</p>
		<p align="justify">Soon after this the Senate confirmed the award of the 
		arbitrators, and Bellingham was delivered over to the College of 
		Commerce, a tribunal established, and acknowledged by treaty, for taking 
		cognisance of commercial matters relating to British subjects. He was to 
		remain in custody till he discharged the debt of the two thousand 
		roubles; but his confinement was by no means severe, for he had 
		permission to walk wherever he pleased, attended by an officer belonging 
		to the College. Lord Granville Leveson Gower being at this time 
		ambassador at the Russian Court, Bellingham made frequent application, 
		and at various times received from his secretary small sums of money to 
		support him during his confinement, One night, in particular, he rushed 
		into his lordship's house at St Petersburg, and requested permission to 
		remain all night to avoid being secured by the police, whom he had 
		escaped. This was granted, although the ambassador had no authority to 
		protect him from a legal arrest; but it appears he was afterwards 
		retaken, and, being confined by the authorities of the country, the 
		British ambassador could have no pretence to solicit his release. His 
		lordship, however, in a conversation with the Minister for Foreign 
		Affairs, expressed a personal wish that the Russian Government, seeing 
		no prospect of recovering the money from Bellingham, would liberate him 
		on condition of his immediately returning to England; but we are not 
		told what effect was produced, as the ambassador soon after quitted the 
		Russian Court.</p>
		<p align="justify">Bellingham having, by some means or other, procured 
		his liberation, in the year 1809 returned to England, and at Liverpool 
		commenced the business of an insurance-broker. It appears, however, that, 
		from a constant recital of the circumstances which had occurred in 
		Russia, his complaints were aggravated in his own mind into grievances, 
		and he at length began to talk of demanding redress from the Government 
		for what he termed the culpable misconduct of the officer, Lord 
		Granville Leveson Gower, and his secretary, in omitting to defend his 
		rights as a British subject. He eventually wrote to the Marquis 
		Wellesley, setting forth the nature of his case and the grounds upon 
		which he expected that some compensation would be made. By the noble 
		Marquis he was referred to the Privy Council, and by that body to the 
		Treasury. His efforts being unattended with success in either quarter, 
		he determined to proceed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr Perceval), 
		with a view to obtaining his sanction and support for his demand. Mr 
		Perceval, however -- having made himself master of the case submitted to 
		him -- declined to interfere, and Mr Bellingham was then advised by his 
		friends that the only resource left to him was a petition to Parliament. 
		As an inhabitant of Liverpool, he applied to General Gascoyne, then 
		Member for that city, to present a petition to the House of Commons; but 
		that honourable gentleman, having ascertained upon inquiry that the case 
		was unsupported by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, refused to have 
		anything to do with it. Driven now to pursue a course quite unusual in 
		such cases, he petitioned the Prince Regent; but from him he was 
		referred again to the Treasury, and he again received an intimation that 
		all applications from him must be futile. Three years had now been spent 
		in these constant and fruitless attacks upon the Government, but the 
		unfortunate and misguided gentleman appeared even yet to cherish hopes 
		that his case would be attended to. On one occasion, it is reported, he 
		carried his wife -- who had in vain striven to wean him from what she 
		considered to be his malady -- and another lady to the Secretary of 
		State's office for the purpose of showing them the success with which 
		his exertions were attended; and although he then, as he had before, 
		received a flat denial of his claims, he yet continued to assure them 
		that he did not in the least doubt that ere long all his hopes would be 
		made good, and he would receive compensation for his sufferings. He now 
		adopted a new, and certainly an unprecedented, mode of attack. He wrote 
		to the police magistrates of Bow Street in the following terms:-</p>
		<p align="justify">TO THEIR WORSHIPS THE POLICE MAGISTRATES OF THE 
		PUBLIC OFFICE IN BOW STREET</p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIRS, -- <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I much regret its being my lot to have to apply to your worships 
		under most peculiar and novel circumstances. For the particulars of the 
		case I refer to the enclosed letter of Mr Secretary Ryder, the 
		notification from Mr Perceval, and my petition to Parliament, together 
		with the printed papers herewith. The affair requires no further remark 
		than that I consider his Majesty's Government to have completely 
		endeavoured to close the door of justice, in declining to have, or even 
		to permit, my grievances to be brought before Parliament for redress, 
		which privilege is the birthright of every individual. The purport of 
		the present is, therefore, once more to solicit his Majesty's Ministers, 
		through your medium, to let what is right and proper be done in my 
		instance, which is all I require. Should this reasonable request be 
		finally denied, I shall then feel justified in executing justice myself 
		-- in which case I shall be ready to argue the merits of so reluctant a 
		measure with his Majesty's Attorney-General, wherever and whenever I may 
		be called upon so to do. In the hopes of averting so abhorrent but 
		compulsive an alternative I have the honour to be, sirs, your very 
		humble and obedient servant, <br>
		JOHN BELLINGHAM.<br>
		No. 9 NEW MILLMAN STREET,<br>
		March 23, 1812</p>
		<p align="justify">This letter was at once conveyed to the Members of 
		the Government, but it was treated by them as a mere threat, and no 
		further notice was taken of it than, on Mr Bellingham's again presenting 
		himself, by a fresh refusal being given to him by Mr Read. Once more he 
		applied to the Treasury, and again he was told that he had nothing to 
		expect; and, according to his statement, Mr Hill, whom he now saw, told 
		him that he might resort to whatever measures he thought fit. This he 
		declared he considered a carte blanche to take justice into his own 
		hands, and he accordingly determined to take such measures of revenge as 
		he madly supposed would effectually secure that attention and 
		consideration for his case which he deemed it had not received, and to 
		which it was in his opinion fully entitled.</p>
		<p align="justify">This unhappy determination being made, he began to 
		make the necessary preparations for the foul deed which he contemplated. 
		His first step was to make himself acquainted with the persons of those 
		Ministers who had seats in the House of Commons, and for this purpose he 
		nightly visited the House, and there usually took his seat in the 
		gallery appropriated to strangers; and, having obtained a general 
		knowledge of their persons, he afterwards posted himself in the lobby of 
		the House, in order to be able to identify them. He then purchased a 
		pair of pistols, with powder and ball, and had an additional pocket made 
		in his coat for carrying them the more conveniently.</p>
		<p align="justify">On the evening of the 11th of May, 1812, he took his 
		station behind the folding-doors leading into the body of the House, and 
		at five o'clock, as Mr Perceval advanced up the lobby, he presented one 
		of his pistols and fired. His aim was true, and the ball entered the 
		left breast of his victim and passed through his heart. Mr Perceval 
		reeled a short distance, and exclaiming, &quot;Murder!&quot; in a low tone of 
		voice, fell to the ground. He was instantly picked up by Mr Smith, 
		Member for Norwich, and another gentleman, and carried into the office 
		of the Speaker's secretary, where he expired almost immediately. Loud 
		cries of &quot;Shut the door; let no one out!&quot; were heard immediately after 
		the shot was fired, and several persons exclaimed: &quot;Where's the murderer?&quot; 
		Bellingham, who still held the pistol in his hand, answered, &quot;I am the 
		unfortunate man,&quot; and he was immediately seized and searched. Mr V. G. 
		Dowling was among the first who went up to him, and on his examining his 
		person he found in his left-hand trousers-pocket a pistol loaded with 
		ball and primed. There were also found upon him an opera-glass, with 
		which he had been accustomed to examine the persons of the Members of 
		the House while sitting in the gallery, and a number of papers. Upon his 
		being interrogated as to his motives for committing such an act he 
		replied: &quot;Want of redress, and denial of justice.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">During the momentary confusion which 
		followed the firing of the pistol he made no attempt to escape; and 
		though when taken into custody he betrayed some agitation, he soon 
		recovered his self-possession, and with great calmness answered every 
		question put to him.</p>
		<p align="justify">During his examination before the magistrates 
		upstairs in the House of Commons he still retained his self-possession, 
		and even corrected a witness as to an omission in his evidence. He 
		persisted in denying any personal enmity to Mr Perceval, for whose death 
		he expressed the greatest sorrow, separating, by a confusion of ideas, 
		the man from the Minister; and seemed to think he had not injured the 
		individual though he had taken away the life of the Chancellor of the 
		Exchequer.</p>
		<p align="justify">This event excited the greatest sensation in the 
		country. A Cabinet Council was called, and the mails were stopped, until 
		instructions were prepared to secure tranquillity in the districts; for 
		at first it was apprehended that the assassin was instigated by 
		political motives, and that he was connected with some treasonable 
		association.</p>
		<p align="justify">Measures being provided for securing order through 
		the country and the metropolis, Bellingham was removed, under a strong 
		military escort, about one o'clock in the morning, to Newgate, and 
		conducted to a room adjoining the chapel. One of the head turnkeys and 
		two other persons sat up with him all night. He retired to bed soon 
		after his arrival at the jail; but he was disturbed during the night, 
		and had no sound sleep. He rose soon after seven o'clock, and requested 
		some tea for breakfast, of which, however, he took but little. No 
		private persons were admitted to see him, but he was visited in the 
		course of the day by the sheriffs and some other public functionaries. 
		He conversed very cheerfully with the sheriffs and others who were in 
		his room, and stated that the question would soon be tried, when it 
		would be seen how far he was justified. He considered the whole as a 
		private matter between him and the Government, who gave him a carte 
		blanche to do his worst, which he had done. </p>
		<p align="justify">Alderman Combe, as one of the committing magistrates, 
		was very active in his endeavours to trace Bellingham's connexions and 
		habits, and for that purpose went to the house of a respect able woman 
		where he lodged in New Millman Street, but could learn from her nothing 
		that indicated any conspiracy with others. His landlady represented him 
		as a quiet inoffensive man, though at times rather eccentric, which she 
		instanced by observing that when he had lodged there only three weeks, 
		at 10s 6d per week, she was surprised to find that he had given her 
		servant-maid half-a-guinea for herself. On being told the deed which he 
		had perpetrated, she said that was impossible, for that she had met him 
		a few minutes before the stated time, when he told her that he had just 
		been to buy a prayer-book. She represented him as of a religious turn of 
		mind.</p>
		<p align="justify">In jail the prisoner requested to have pen, ink and 
		paper, to write some letters to his friends, and he accordingly wrote 
		one to his family at Liverpool, which was delivered open to Mr Newman. 
		The following was sent to Mrs Roberts, No 9 New Millman Street, the lady 
		at whose house he lodged. It will serve to show the state of his mind in 
		the miserable situation to which he had reduced himself:</p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday morning, Old Bailey<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEAR MADAM -- Yesterday midnight I was escorted to this neighbourhood 
		by a noble troop of Light Horse, and delivered into the care of Mr 
		Newman (by Mr Taylor, the magistrate and M.P.) as a state prisoner of 
		the first class. For eight years I have never found my mind so tranquil 
		as since this melancholy but necessary catastrophe, as the merits or 
		demerits of my peculiar case must be regularly unfolded in a criminal 
		court of justice to ascertain the guilty party, by a jury of my country. 
		I have to request the favour of you to send me three or four shirts, 
		some cravats, handkerchiefs, night-caps, stockings, &amp;c, out of my 
		drawers, together with comb, soap, tooth-brush, with any other trifle 
		that presents itself which you think I may have occasion for, and 
		inclose them in my leather trunk, and the key please to send sealed, per 
		bearer; also my great-coat, flannel gown, and black waistcoat: which 
		will much oblige,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dear madam, your very obedient servant,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'JOHN BELLINGHAM.</p>
		<p align="justify">'To the above please to add the prayer-books.'</p>
		<p align="justify">Soon after two o'clock the wretched prisoner ate a 
		hearty dinner, and requested that in future he might dine at about the 
		same hour, and after passing the rest of the day in a tranquil manner, 
		he retired to bed at twelve and slept until seven the next morning, 
		being attended by two persons during the night. He breakfasted at about 
		nine o'clock, and appeared perfectly composed, and on the sheriffs 
		revisiting him, accompanied by several gentlemen, he was found to be 
		unaltered in his demeanour. On his being spoken to on the subject of his 
		trial, he conversed with apparent indifference, but on the melancholy 
		fact of Mr Perceval's murder being alluded to, he became less tranquil, 
		persisted in vindicating the act, and said that when his trial came on 
		before a jury of his countrymen, it would be for them to determine how 
		far a minister of the crown was justified in refusing justice to an 
		injured individual. He declared that if he had a thousand lives to lose, 
		he would have risked them in the pursuit of justice in the same way. He 
		spoke of the result of his trial with the utmost confidence, and on his 
		being asked whether he had any commands to his wife at Liverpool, he 
		declared that he had not, and that in a day or two he should join her in 
		that city.</p>
		<p align="justify">On the 15th of May, 1812, four days after the death 
		of Mr Perceval, the trial of the prisoner came on at the Old Bailey. The 
		judges at ten o'clock took their seats on each side of the Lord Mayor; 
		and the recorder, the Duke of Clarence, the Marquis Wellesley and almost 
		all the aldermen of the City of London occupied the bench. The court was 
		crowded to excess, and no distinction of rank was observed, so that 
		Members of the House of Commons were forced to mingle in the throng. 
		There were also present a great number of ladies, all led by the most 
		intense curiosity to behold the assassin, and to hear what he might urge 
		in defence or in palliation of his atrocious act.</p>
		<p align="justify">At length Bellingham appeared, and advanced to the 
		bar with a firm step, and quite undismayed. He bowed to the Court most 
		respectfully, and even gracefully; and it is impossible to describe the 
		impression which his appearance, accompanied by this unexpected 
		fortitude, produced. He was dressed in a light brown surtout coat and 
		striped yellow waistcoat; his hair plainly dressed, and without powder.</p>
		<p align="justify">Before the prisoner was called on regularly to plead, 
		Mr Alley, his counsel, made application to have the trial postponed, for 
		the purpose of procuring proofs of his client's insanity, which was 
		alleged in two affidavits he held: he said that he had no doubt, if time 
		were allowed, that the prisoner could be proved to be insane. Mr Alley 
		was here interrupted by the court, who refused to hear him until the 
		prisoner had first pleaded.</p>
		<p align="justify">The indictment was then read, and the usual question, 
		'Guilty, or not guilty?' was put to Bellingham, when he addressed the 
		court: 'My lords -- Before I can plead to this indictment, I must state, 
		in justice to myself, that by hurrying on my trial I am placed in a most 
		remarkable situation. It so happens that my prosecutors are actually the 
		witnesses against me. All the documents on which alone I could rest my 
		defence have been taken from me and are now in possession of the Crown. 
		It is only two days since I was told to prepare for my defence, and when 
		I asked for my papers, I was told they could not be given up. It is 
		therefore, my lords, rendered utterly impossible for me to go into my 
		justification, and under the circumstances in which I find myself, a 
		trial is absolutely useless. The papers are to be given to me after the 
		trial, but how can that avail me for my defence? I am, therefore, not 
		ready for my trial.'</p>
		<p align="justify">The Attorney-General was proceeding to explain to the 
		court what had been done with reference to the prisoner's papers, when 
		Chief Justice Mansfield interrupted him, observing, it was necessary the 
		prisoner should first plead.</p>
		<p align="justify">The prisoner was again interrogated, when he pleaded 
		'Not guilty' to both counts of the indictment.</p>
		<p align="justify">The Attorney-General -- 'I will now answer what has 
		fallen from the prisoner. He says that he has been denied access to his 
		papers. It is true that Government, for the purposes of justice, has 
		retained them -- but it is also true that he has been informed that if 
		he asked for them at the time of his trial they should be ready, and any 
		of them, which he might think useful to his defence, should be given to 
		him: and in the meantime, if he considered it necessary, he might have 
		copies of them. This we are ready to verify on oath.'</p>
		<p align="justify">The clerk of the arraigns, Mr Shelton, then read the 
		indictment, which charged the prisoner in the usual way with the murder 
		of the Right Hon Spencer Perceval, with which he was also charged on the 
		coroner's inquisition.</p>
		<p align="justify">Mr Abbott having opened the case, the Attorney-General 
		addressed the jury. He said that a lamentable and painful task devolved 
		upon him to state to the jury the circumstances of this horrid murder -- 
		a crime perpetrated on a man whose whole life, he should have thought, 
		would have guarded and protected him against such an attack, who, he was 
		sure, if enough of life had been left him to see by whose hand he had 
		fallen, would have spent his last moment in uttering a prayer for the 
		forgiveness of his murderer. But It was not a time for him to dwell on 
		the public loss, which had been sustained -- its brightest ornament had 
		been torn from the country, but the country had done justice to his 
		memory. These were not considerations, however, by which they must be 
		swayed. It was not revenge, nor was it resentment, that ought to have 
		any influence on their consideration of the question. They were to 
		satisfy public justice -- to take care, by their verdict, that the 
		public should not be exposed to such horrid crimes. With respect to the 
		prisoner, he knew nothing, nor did he know how his life had been spent, 
		except so far as related to the circumstances of the case. He had been 
		in business and had acted as a merchant, in the course of which he had 
		shown himself a man of sound understanding in every act which he 
		performed; and he had not only conducted his own affairs with 
		understanding, but he had been selected by other persons to manage 
		theirs.</p>
		<p align="justify">Having stated the main facts of the case as we have 
		already detailed them, he entreated the jury to consider it not as the 
		murder of so eminent a person, but as the murder of a common individual 
		-- to suppose the meanest subject to have suffered as Mr Perceval had 
		suffered, and to return their verdict as they would upon that case. Was 
		he or was he not guilty? To that point they must direct their attention, 
		and he knew of no reason to cause even a doubt. But what remained? This 
		only -- the attempt which had been made that day to put off the trial of 
		the prisoner, on the ground of his being fit for this or any other crime, 
		as he was afflicted with insanity. Let them consider this a little. The 
		prisoner was a man conducting himself like others in all the ordinary 
		circumstances of life -- who carried on business, none of his family or 
		friends interfering -- no pretence being suggested that he was unable to 
		superintend his own affairs. What clearer proofs, then, could be given 
		to show, contrary to the defence set up, that he was not what the law 
		called <i>non compos mentis</i> -- that he was an accountable being?</p>
		<p align="justify">He knew the cases where the plea of insanity would be 
		received -- where for instance a murder was committed by a person whose 
		mental infirmity might be considered as very nearly the absence of all 
		mind. Against their defence there was no argument. But he was this day 
		to learn whether the wickedness of the act which the prisoner was called 
		on to answer was to be considered an excuse for its perpetration. 
		Travelling through his whole life, what ground could they adduce for 
		such a plea? His every act appeared rational except one, and that was 
		only irrational, because it was so horrid that the imagination of man 
		could not fancy to itself the existence of so atrocious a deed. But how 
		far must this argument go? It must arrive at this conclusion -- that 
		every act of gross and unusual atrocity would carry its defence along 
		with it, that every act of peculiar horror would have within itself a 
		certain defence, for the barbarity of the deed would be considered as a 
		proof that the mind which directed it was not in a state of sufficient 
		security to judge whether the action was right or wrong. If the mind 
		possessed the power of forming that judgement, the prisoner was 
		criminally accountable for the act. A man might be infirm in mind, 
		insufficient to dispose of his property or to judge of the claims of his 
		respective relatives, and if he were in that situation, the management 
		of his affairs might be taken from him and vested in trustees: but such 
		a man was not discharged from criminal acts because he could not 
		transact civil business. Many cases had occurred within his memory in 
		courts of law, in which it was proved that a person in many respects had 
		evinced symptoms of insanity up to a certain time; but the question then 
		was, whether that insanity was of such a description as precluded or 
		permitted the knowledge of right or wrong? In every one of the cases 
		which recurred to his memory, though a certain degree of madness was 
		proved, still as the parties seemed to have sufficient sense to 
		distinguish right from wrong at the time of the perpetration of the acts 
		charged against them, they were held to be criminally accountable. Here 
		there was no deficiency of understanding whatever. No opinion of others 
		to that effect was adduced: on the contrary, he was entrusted with the 
		management of his own and others' affairs. the question was, whether at 
		the time the murder was perpetrated he possessed sufficient sense to 
		distinguish between right and wrong? What conclusion could they draw in 
		favour of the idea which had been suggested? Let them take from their 
		recollection the frightful nature of the act with the commission of 
		which he was charged, let them take from it its accumulated horrors, and 
		time prisoner stood before them in a state of sanity, and fully 
		accountable for the act, of which, he thought, little doubt could be 
		entertained he had been guilty.</p>
		<p align="justify">The learned gentleman concluded by expressing his 
		satisfaction at the fact that the prisoner stood alone on that occasion, 
		that he was unconnected with, and unaided and uninfluenced by, any other 
		person or party in the country, and that this deed could not therefore 
		be attributed to any but the personal feelings which he entertained 
		towards His Majesty's Government. On him, and on him only, did the 
		disgrace which he had excited rest, and the character of the country was 
		entirely free from any participation in it.</p>
		<p align="justify">The first witness called on time part of the Crown 
		was:</p>
		<p align="justify">Mr William Smith (M.P. for Norwich) who, being sworn, 
		deposed as follows:</p>
		<p align="justify">He was on his way to attend the House of Commons on 
		the evening of Monday the 11th of May, and was going through the lobby 
		towards the door of the house, when he heard the report of a pistol, 
		which appeared to have been fired close to the entrance door of the 
		lobby. Immediately on the report, he turned towards the place from 
		whence the noise appeared to proceed, and observed a tumult and probably 
		a dozen or more persons about the spot. Almost in the same instant he 
		saw a person rush hastily from among the crowd, and heard several voices 
		cry out, 'Shut the doors -- let no one escape.' The person came towards 
		him from the crowd, looking first one way, then another, rather like one 
		seeking for shelter than a person wounded. But taking two or three steps 
		towards the witness, he reeled by him and almost instantaneously fell on 
		the floor with his face downward, Before he fell, witness heard him cry, 
		though not very distinctly, and in what he uttered, he heard the word 'murder!' 
		or something very like it. When he first fell, witness thought that he 
		might have been slightly wounded, and expected to see him make an effort 
		to rise. But gazing on him for a few moments, he observed that he did 
		not stir at all, and he, therefore, immediately stooped down to raise 
		him front the ground, requesting the assistance of a gentleman close by 
		him for the purpose. As soon as they had turned his face upwards, and 
		not till then, he found that it was Mr Perceval. They then took him into 
		their arms, and carried him into the office of the Speaker's secretary, 
		where they seated themselves on the table, with Mr Perceval between them, 
		also sitting on the table, and resting on their arms. His face was now 
		perfectly pale, the blood issuing in small quantities from each corner 
		of his mouth, and probably in two or three minutes from the firing of 
		the pistol all signs of life had ceased. The eyes of the unfortunate 
		gentleman were open, but he did not appear to know witness, nor to take 
		any notice of any person about him, nor did he utter the least 
		articulate sound from the moment he fell. A few convulsive sobs, which 
		lasted perhaps three or four moments, together with a scarcely 
		perceptible pulse, were the only signs of life which appeared then, and 
		those continued but a very short time longer. When witness felt Mr 
		Perceval's pulse for the last time, just before Mr Lynn, the surgeon, 
		arrived, it appeared to him that he was quite dead. Witness remained 
		supporting the body until it was conveyed into the Speaker's house, but 
		he was unable to give any account of what passed in the lobby.</p>
		<p align="justify">Mr William Lynn, a surgeon in Great George Street, de 
		posed that he was called to the deceased, hut on his arrival he was 
		quite dead. There was blood upon his white waistcoat and shirt, and upon 
		his examining the body, he found that there was an opening in the skin, 
		he probed the wound three inches down wards, and entertained no doubt 
		that the pistol-ball passed into the heart, and was the cause of death.</p>
		<p align="justify">Mr Henry Burgess, a solicitor who was in the lobby, 
		stated, that after having seen Mr Perceval fall, as had been already 
		described, he heard someone exclaim, 'That's the man!' and saw a hand 
		pointing towards the bench by the fire-place which is on one side of the 
		lobby, he immediately went over to the bench and saw the prisoner at the 
		bar sitting on it in great agitation. There were one or two persons by 
		him. He looked at his hands, and saw his left hand on the bench; and 
		near or under his other hand he saw a pistol, which he took, and asked 
		the prisoner what had induced him to do such a deed? He replied, 'Want 
		of redress of grievances and refusal by government', or words to that 
		effect. Witness then said to the prisoner, 'You have another pistol?' he 
		replied, 'Yes.' Witness asked if it was loaded, to which he answered in 
		the affirmative. Witness then saw some person take the other pistol from 
		his person. The pistol which witness took from the prisoner was warm, 
		and appeared as if it had been recently discharged. The lock was down 
		and the pan open. (Here the pistol was produced, and recognized by the 
		witness.) He then stated, that he put his hand into the right waist coat-pocket 
		of the prisoner, from which he took a small penknife and a pencil, and 
		from his left-hand waistcoat-pocket he took a bunch of keys and some 
		money. The prisoner was detained in custody, and examined shortly 
		afterwards above stairs in the House of Commons before the magistrates. 
		Witness related in the presence of the prisoner, on that occasion, the 
		facts which he had now detailed. When he had concluded, the prisoner 
		made an observation to this effect, as well as he could recollect. 'I 
		wish to correct Mr Burgess' statement in one point; but I believe he is 
		perfectly correct in every other. Instead of my hand being, as Mr 
		Burgess stated, upon or near the pistol, I think he took it from my hand 
		or upon it.'</p>
		<p align="justify">James Taylor, a tailor, at No 11 North Place, Gray's 
		Inn Lane, deposed that he had been employed by the prisoner to repair 
		some clothes. He was afterwards in Guildford Street, when the prisoner 
		called him, and took him to his lodgings in Millman Street, and there 
		directed him to put a side-pocket into a coat, which he gave him, of a 
		particular length which he pointed out. He completed the job on the same 
		night, and carried the coat home.</p>
		<p align="justify">Mr John Morris stated that he often attended in the 
		gallery appropriated for strangers, and went down to the House on Monday, 
		the 11th of May, for that purpose. he passed into the lobby about the 
		hour of five in the afternoon. He observed the prisoner at the bar 
		standing in the lobby near the outer door: he was standing beside that 
		part of the door which is generally closed, it was a double door, and 
		one half was usually closed, within which half tile prisoner was 
		standing, and anyone to have entered the lobby must have passed him at 
		unit's length. He observed the prisoner as if watching for somebody 
		coming, and he appeared to look anxiously towards the door. As well as 
		the witness recollected, the prisoner had his right hand within the left 
		breast of his coat. Witness passed on to the staircase of the gallery, 
		and almost immediately after he got into the upper lobby, he heard the 
		report of a pistol, and found soon after that it was connected with the 
		fatal event which occurred on that evening. He had frequently seen the 
		prisoner before in the gallery, where gentlemen who report the 
		parliamentary proceedings resorted, and about the passages of the House 
		of Commons.</p>
		<p align="justify">John Vickery, a Bow Street officer, said that he went 
		on Monday afternoon to New Millman Street, to the lodgings of the 
		prisoner, which he searched, and found, in the bedroom upstairs, a pair 
		of pistol-bags, and in the same drawer a small powder-flask and some 
		powder in a small paper, a box with some bullets, and some small flints 
		wrapped in paper. There was also a pistol-key to unscrew the pistol for 
		the purpose of loading, and some sand-paper and a pistol-mould. The 
		witness on comparing e bullet found in the loaded pistol with the mould, 
		and the screw with the pistols, found them all to correspond.</p>
		<p align="justify">Mr Vincent George Dowling was next called. He stated 
		that he was in the gallery on the afternoon in question, and ran down 
		into the lobby on hearing the report of a pistol. He saw the prisoner at 
		the bar sitting on a stool, and going to him, he seized him and began to 
		search his person. he took from his left—hand small-clothes pocket a 
		small pistol, which he produced and which, on his examining it, he found 
		to be loaded with powder and ball. It was primed as well as loaded. The 
		pistol which had been discharged and that which he took from the 
		prisoner were in his belief a brace: they were of the same size and bore, 
		and were marked with the same maker's name. The witness had seen the 
		prisoner several times before in the gallery and in the avenues of the 
		house, and to the best of his recollection the last the he saw him was 
		six or seven days before the death of Mr Perceval, He was frequently in 
		the gallery during the debates, and upon several occasions entered into 
		conversation with the witness. He had often asked for information as to 
		the names of the gentlemen speaking, and also as to the persons of the 
		members of His Majesty's Government.</p>
		<p align="justify">Other witnesses from Newgate produced tile coat worn 
		by the prisoner at the tine of his apprehension, amid it was identified 
		by Taylor as the same one which he had put the side-pocket.</p>
		<p align="justify">Lord Chief Justice Mansfield then addressed the 
		prisoner, and told him, that the case on the part of the Crown being now 
		gone through, the period was come for him to make any defence he might 
		wish to offer.</p>
		<p align="justify">The prisoner asked whether his counsel had nothing to 
		urge in his defence?</p>
		<p align="justify">Mr Alley informed him that his counsel were not 
		entitled to speak.</p>
		<p align="justify">The prisoner then said that the documents and papers 
		necessary to his defence had been taken out of his pocket, and had not 
		since been restored to him.</p>
		<p align="justify">Mr Garrow said that it was the intention of the 
		counsel for the Crown to restore him his papers, having first proved 
		them to be the same which were taken from him, and that they had not 
		suffered any subtraction: his solicitor already had copies of them.</p>
		<p align="justify">General Gascoigne and Mr Hume (M.P. for Weymouth) 
		proved that the papers were those which had been taken from the person 
		of the prisoner, and that they had been in their custody ever since, and 
		had suffered no subtraction.</p>
		<p align="justify">The papers were then handed to the prisoner, who 
		proceeded to arrange and examine them.</p>
		<p align="justify">The prisoner, who had been hitherto sitting, now rose 
		and, bowing respectfully to the court and jury, went into his defence, 
		in a firm tone of voice, and without any appearance of embarrassment. He 
		spoke nearly to the following effect:</p>
		<p align="justify">'I feel great personal obligation to the Attorney-General 
		for the objection which he has made to the plea of insanity. I think it 
		is far more fortunate that such a plea as that should have been 
		unfounded, than that it should have existed in fact. I am obliged to my 
		counsel, however, for having thus endeavoured to consult my interest, as 
		I am convinced the attempt has arisen from the kindest motives. That I 
		am or have been insane is a circumstance of which I am not apprised, 
		except in the single instance of my having been confined in Russia: how 
		far that may be considered as affecting my present situation, it is not 
		for me to determine. This is the first time that I have ever spoken in 
		public in this way. I feel my own incompetency, but I trust you will 
		attend to the substance, rather than to the manner, of my investigating 
		the truth of an affair which has occasioned my presence at this bar.</p>
		<p align="justify">'I beg to assure you that the crime which I have 
		committed has arisen from compulsion rather than from any hostility to 
		the man whom it has been my fate to destroy. Considering the amiable 
		character and universally admitted virtues of Mr Perceval, I feel, if I 
		could murder him in a cool and unjustifiable manner, I should not 
		deserve to live another moment in this world. Conscious, however, that I 
		shall be able to justify everything which I have done, I feel some 
		degree of confidence in meeting the storm which assails me, and shall 
		now proceed to unfold a catalogue of circumstances which, while they 
		harrow up my own soul, will, I am sure, tend to the extenuation of my 
		conduct in this honourable court. This, as has already been candidly 
		stated by the Attorney—General, is the first instance in which the 
		slightest imputation has been cast upon my moral character. Until this 
		fatal catastrophe, which no one can more heartily regret than I do, not 
		excepting even the family of Mr Perceval himself, I have stood alike 
		pure in the minds of those who have known me, and in the judgement of my 
		own heart. I hope I see this affair in the true light.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">'For eight years, gentlemen of the 
		jury, have I been exposed to all the miseries which it is possible for 
		human nature to endure. Driven almost to despair, I sought for redress 
		in vain. For this affair I had the carte blanche of government, as I 
		will prove by the most incontestible evidence, namely, the writing of 
		the Secretary of State himself. I come before you under peculiar 
		disadvantages. Many of my most material papers are now at Liver pool, 
		for which I have written; but I have been called upon my trial before it 
		was possible to obtain an answer to my letter. Without witnesses, 
		therefore, and in the absence of many papers necessary to my 
		justification, I am sure you will admit I have just grounds for claiming 
		some indulgence. I must state that after my voyage to Archangel, I 
		transmitted a petition to his royal highness the Prince Regent, through 
		Mr Windle, my solicitor, and in consequence of there being no reply I 
		came to London to see the result. Surprised at the delay, and conceiving 
		that the interests of my country were at stake, I considered this step 
		as essential, as well for the assertion of my own right as for the 
		vindication of the national honour. I waited upon Colonel MacMahon, who 
		stated that my petition had been received, but, owing to some accident, 
		had been mislaid. Under these circumstances, I drew out another account 
		of the particulars of the Russian affair, and this may be considered the 
		commencement of that train of events which led to the afflicting and 
		unhappy fate of Mr Perceval.'</p>
		<p align="justify">The prisoner then read various documents containing 
		the statement of the whole of his affairs in Russia. In the course of 
		narrating these hardships, he took occasion to explain several points, 
		adverting with great feeling to the unhappy situation in which he was 
		placed, from the circumstance of his having been lately married to his 
		wife, then about twenty years of age, with an infant at her breast, and 
		who had been waiting for him at St Petersburgh, in order that she might 
		accompany him to England, a prey to all those anxieties which the 
		unexpected and cruel incarceration of her husband, without any just 
		grounds, was calculated to excite. (He was here much affected.) He also 
		de scribed his feelings at a subsequent period, when his wife, from an 
		anxiety to reach her native country (England) when in a state of 
		pregnancy, and looking to the improbability of his liberation, was 
		obliged to quit Petersburgh unprotected, and under take the voyage at 
		the peril of her life, while Lord L. Gower and Sir S. Sharp suffered him 
		to remain in a situation worse than death. 'My God! my God!' he 
		exclaimed, 'what heart could bear such excruciating tortures, without 
		bursting with indignation at conduct so diametrically opposite to 
		justice and to humanity. I appeal to you, gentlemen of the jury, as men 
		-- I appeal to you as brothers -- I appeal to you as Christians --whether, 
		under such circumstances of persecution, it was possible to regard the 
		actions of the ambassador and consul of my own country with any other 
		feelings but those of detestation and horror! In using language thus 
		strong, I feel that I commit an error; yet does my heart tell me, that 
		towards men who lent themselves thus to bolster up the basest acts of 
		persecution, there are no observations, however strong, which the strict 
		justice of the case would not excuse my using. Had I been so fortunate 
		as to have met Lord Leveson Gower instead of that truly amiable and 
		highly lamented individual, Mr Perceval, he is the man who should have 
		received the ball!'</p>
		<p align="justify">Bellingham then went on to recount at great length 
		the history of his various attempts to obtain satisfaction from the 
		Government, which have already been described, ending with his letter to 
		the Bow Street magistrates quoted above.</p>
		<p align="justify">'In the course of two days,' he continued, 'I called 
		again at Bow Street for an answer to this letter, when I received a 
		little memorandum, in Mr Reid's writing, in which he states that he 
		cannot interfere in my affairs, and that he had felt it his duty to 
		communicate the contents of my packet to the Secretary of State. Had he 
		done otherwise he would have been extremely reprehensible, as events 
		have turned out so calamitously -- events which go to my heart to allude 
		to. (Much affected.) At last, in reply to letter of the 13th of April, 1 
		received a final and direct answer, which at once convinced me that I 
		had no reason to expect any adjustment whatever of those claims which I 
		had on His Majesty's government, for my criminal detention in Russia.</p>
		<p align="justify">'After this, on personal application at the office of 
		the Secretary f State, and intimating my intention to take justice in my 
		own hand, I was told, by the mouth of Mr Hill, that I was at liberty to 
		take such measures as I thought proper. Who then is to be reprobated in 
		this case -- those who were regardless of every feeling of honour and of 
		justice, or him who, spurred on by injury and neglect, and with a due 
		notice of his intentions, pursued the only course likely to lead to a 
		satisfactory termination of calamities which had weighed him down to the 
		lowest ebb of misery? I will now only mention a few observations by way 
		of defence. You have before you all the particulars of this melancholy 
		transaction. Believe me, gentlemen, the rashness of which I have been 
		guilty has not been dictated by any personal animosity to Mr Perceval, 
		rather than injure whom from private or malicious motives I would suffer 
		my limbs to be cut from my body. (Here the prisoner seemed again much 
		agitated.)</p>
		<p align="justify">'If, whenever I am called before the tribunal of God, 
		I can appear with as clear a conscience as I now possess in regard to 
		the alleged charge of the wilful murder of the unfortunate gentleman, 
		the investigation of whose death has occupied your attention, it would 
		be happy for me, as essentially securing to me eternal salvation; but 
		that is impossible. That my arm has been the means of his melancholy and 
		lamented exit, I am ready to allow. But to constitute murder, it must 
		clearly and absolutely be proved to have arisen from malice prepense and 
		with a malicious design, as I have no doubt the learned judge will 
		shortly lay down, in explaining the law on the subject. If such is the 
		case, I am guilty: if not, I look forward with confidence to your 
		acquittal.</p>
		<p align="justify">'That the contrary is the case has been most clearly 
		and irrefutably proved. No doubt can rest upon your minds, as my uniform 
		and undeviating object has been an endeavour to obtain justice, 
		according to law, for a series of the most long-continued and unmerited 
		sufferings that were ever submitted to a court of law, without having 
		been guilty of any other crime than an appeal for redress for a most 
		flagrant injury offered to my sovereign and my country, wherein my 
		liberty and property have fallen a sacrifice for the continued period of 
		eight years, to the total ruin of myself and family (with authenticated 
		documents of the truth of the allegations), merely because it was Mr 
		Perceval's plea sure that justice should not be granted, sheltering 
		himself with the idea of there being no alternative remaining, as my 
		petition to parliament for redress could not be brought (as having a 
		pecuniary tendency) without the sanction of His Majesty's ministers, and 
		that he was determined to oppose my claim, by trampling both on law and 
		right.</p>
		<p align="justify">'Gentlemen, where a man has so strong and serious a 
		criminal case to bring forward as mine has been, the nature of which was 
		purely national, it is the bounden duty of Government to attend to it; 
		for justice is a matter of right and not of valour. And when a minister 
		is so unprincipled and presumptuous at any time, but especially in a 
		case of such urgent necessity, to set himself above both the sovereign 
		and the laws, as has been the case with Mr Perceval, he must do it at 
		his personal risk; for by the law he cannot be protected.</p>
		<p align="justify">'Gentlemen, if this is not fact, the mere will of a 
		minister would be law: it would be this thing today and the other thing 
		tomorrow, as either interest or caprice might dictate. What would become 
		of our liberties? Where would be the purity and the impartiality of the 
		justice we so much boast of? The Government's non-attendance to the 
		dictates of justice is solely to be attributed the melancholy 
		catastrophe of the unfortunate gentleman, as any malicious intention to 
		his injury was the most remote from my heart. Justice, and justice only, 
		was my object, which Government uniformly objected to grant. The 
		distress it reduced me to, drove me to despair in consequence, and, 
		purely for the purpose of having this singular affair legally 
		investigated, I gave notice at the public office, Bow Street, requesting 
		the magistrates to acquaint His Majesty's ministers, that if they 
		persisted in refusing justice, or even to permit me to bring my just 
		petition into parliament for redress, I should be under the imperious 
		necessity of executing justice myself, solely for the purpose of 
		ascertaining, through a criminal court, whether His Majesty's ministers 
		have the power to refuse justice to a well-authenticated and irrefutable 
		act of oppression, committed by the consul and ambassador abroad, 
		whereby my sovereign's and country's honour were materially tarnished, 
		by my person endeavouring to be made the stalking-horse of justification, 
		to one of the greatest insults that could be offered to the crown. But 
		in order to avoid so reluctant and abhorrent an alternative, I hoped to 
		be allowed to bring my petition to the House of Commons -- or that they 
		would do what was right and proper themselves. On my return from Russia, 
		I brought most serious charges to the privy council, both against Sir 
		Stephen Shairp and Lord Granville Leveson Gower, when the affair was 
		determined to be purely national, and consequently it was the duty of 
		His Majesty's ministers to arrange it by acting on the resolution of the 
		council. Suppose, for instance, the charge I brought could have been 
		proved to be erroneous, should not I have been called to a severe 
		account for my conduct? But, being true, ought not I to have been 
		redressed?</p>
		<p align="justify">'It is a melancholy fact, that the warping of justice, 
		including all the various ramifications in which it operates, occasions 
		more misery in the world, in a immoral sense, than all the acts of God 
		in a physical one, with which he punishes mankind for their 
		transgressions -- a confirmation of which, the single, but strong, 
		instance before you is one remarkable proof.</p>
		<p align="justify">'If a poor unfortunate man stops another upon the 
		highway, and robs him of but a few shillings, he may be called upon to 
		forfeit his life. But I have been robbed of my liberty for years, ill-treated 
		beyond precedent, torn from my wife and family, bereaved of all my 
		property to make good the consequences of such irregularities, deprived 
		and bereaved of everything that makes life valuable, and then called 
		upon to forfeit it, because Mr Perceval has been pleased to patronize 
		iniquity that ought to have been punished, for the sake of a vote or two 
		in the House of Commons, with, perhaps, a similar good turn elsewhere.</p>
		<p align="justify">'Is there, gentlemen, any comparison between the 
		enormity of these two offenders? No more than a mite to a mountain. Yet 
		the one is carried to the gallows, while the other stalks in security, 
		fancying himself beyond the reach of law or justice: the most honest man 
		suffers, while the other goes forward in triumph to new and more 
		extended enormities.</p>
		<p align="justify">'We have had a recent and striking instance of some 
		unfortunate men who have been called upon to pay their lives as the 
		forfeit of their allegiance, in endeavouring to mitigate the rigours of 
		a prison. But, gentlemen, where is the proportion between the crimes for 
		which they suffered, and what the Government has been guilty of, in 
		withholding its protection from me? Even in a Crown case, after the 
		years of sufferings, I have been called upon to sacrifice all my 
		property and the welfare of my family, to bolster up the iniquities of 
		the Crown. And then am prosecuted for my life, because I have taken the 
		only possible alternative to bring the affair to a public investigation, 
		for the purpose of being enabled to return to the bosom of my family 
		with some degree of comfort and honour. Every man within the sound of my 
		voice must feel for my situation; but by you, gentle men of the jury, it 
		must be felt in a peculiar degree, who are husbands and fathers, and can 
		fancy yourselves in my situation. I trust that this serious lesson will 
		operate as a warning to all future ministers, and lead them to do the 
		thing that is right, as an unerring rule of conduct, for, if the 
		superior classes were more correct in their proceedings, the extensive 
		ramifications of evil would, in a great measure, be hemmed up. A notable 
		proof of the fact is, that this court would never have been troubled 
		with the case before it, had their conduct been guided by these 
		principles.</p>
		<p align="justify">'I have now occupied the attention of the court for a 
		period much longer than I intended, yet I trust they will consider the 
		awfulness of my situation to be a sufficient ground for a trespass which, 
		under other circumstances, would be inexcusable. Sooner than suffer what 
		I have suffered for the last eight years, how ever, I should consider 
		five hundred deaths, if it were possible for human nature to endure them, 
		a fate far more preferable. Lost so long to all the endearments of my 
		family, bereaved of all the blessings of life, and deprived of its 
		greatest sweet, liberty, as the weary traveller, who has long been 
		pelted by the pitiless storm, welcomes the much desired inn, I shall 
		receive death as the relief of all my sorrows. I shall not occupy your 
		attention longer, but, relying on the justice of God, and submitting 
		myself to the dictates of your conscience, I submit to the <i>fiat</i> 
		of my fate, firmly anticipating an acquittal from a charge so abhorrent 
		to every feeling of my soul.'</p>
		<p align="justify">Here the prisoner bowed, and his counsel immediately 
		proceeded to call the witnesses for the defence.</p>
		<p align="justify">Anne Billet, who appeared under the strongest 
		impressions of grief, being sworn, deposed that she lived in the county 
		of Southampton: she came to London in consequence of having read in the 
		newspapers of the prisoner having been apprehended for the murder of Mr 
		Perceval. She was induced to come to town, from a conviction that she 
		knew more of him than any other friend. She knew him from a child. He 
		resided latterly at Liverpool, from whence he came at Christmas last. 
		She knew him to be a merchant. His father died insane in Titchfield 
		Street, Oxford Road. She firmly believed that for the last three or four 
		years the prisoner was in a state of derangement, respecting the 
		business which he had been pursuing. She had not seen him for twelve 
		months until the present moment. She always thought him deranged when 
		his Russian affairs were the subject of conversation.</p>
		<p align="justify">When cross-examined by Mr Garrow, she deposed that, 
		when in London with the prisoner about twelve months since, he was going 
		to different government offices to seek redress of his grievances. He 
		was then in a state of derangement, as he had been ever since his return 
		from Russia. There was one instance which occurred at the period to 
		which she was alluding, which strongly confirmed her in the opinion of 
		his insanity. About Christmas he told his wife and witness, that now he 
		was come from Russia he had realized more than 100,000L., with which he 
		intended to buy an estate in the west of England and to have a house in 
		London. He admitted that he had not got the money, but said it was the 
		same as if he had, for he had gained his cause in Russia and our 
		government would make good all the loss he had sustained. He repeatedly 
		said to her and to his wife that this was assuredly the fact. Upon one 
		occasion he took Mrs Bellingham and the witness to the Secretary of 
		State's office, where they saw Mr Smith, who said if he had not ladies 
		with him he would not have come to him at all. The prisoner told Mr 
		Smith, that the reason why he brought them was to convince them that his 
		claims were just, and that he would very shortly receive the money. Mr 
		Smith told him he could say nothing upon this subject: he had already 
		sent him a letter alleging that he had nothing to expect. The prisoner 
		then requested Mr Smith would answer him one question -- 'My friends say 
		I am out of my senses. Is it your opinion that I am so?' Mr Smith said 
		it was a very delicate question, and one he did not wish to answer. 
		Having then departed, when they got into the carriage which waited for 
		them, he took hold of his wife's hand and said, 'I hope, now, my dear, 
		you are convinced all will now end as we wish.' Since that period she 
		knew that he had been pursuing his object alone, his wife remaining at 
		Liverpool.</p>
		<p align="justify">Other witnesses were called, who deposed to like 
		facts and to their belief in the insanity of the prisoner, but Lord 
		Chief Justice Mansfield having summed up the case, the jury, after a 
		consultation of two minutes and a half in the box, expressed a wish to 
		retire, and an officer of the court being sworn, accompanied them to the 
		jury-room. As they passed out, the prisoner regarded them separately 
		with a look of mingled confidence and complacency. They were absent 
		fourteen minutes, and, on their return into court, their countenances, 
		acting as indices to their minds, at once unfolded the determination to 
		which they had come. The prisoner again directed his attention to them 
		in the same manner as before.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The names being called over, and the 
		verdict asked for in the usual form, the foreman in a faltering voice, 
		announced the fatal decision of -- Guilty.</p>
		<p align="justify">The prisoner's countenance here indicated surprise, 
		unmixed, however, with any demonstrations of that concern which the 
		awfulness of his situation was calculated to produce.</p>
		<p align="justify">The Recorder then passed the awful sentence of death 
		on the prisoner in the most feeling manner, and he was ordered for 
		execution on the following Monday, his body to be anatomized. He 
		received the sentence without any emotion.</p>
		<p align="justify">From the time of his condemnation the unfortunate 
		convict was fed upon bread and water. All means of suicide were removed, 
		and he was not allowed to be shaved -- a prohibition which gave him much 
		concern, as he feared he should not appear as a gentleman. He was 
		visited by the ordinary on Saturday, and some religious gentlemen called 
		on him on Sunday, with whose conversation he seemed greatly pleased. He 
		appeared naturally depressed by his situation; but persisted in a 
		resolute denial of his guilt. He frequently said that he had prepared 
		himself to go to his Father, and that he should be pleased when the hour 
		came.</p>
		<p align="justify">Being informed by Mr Newman that two gentlemen from 
		Liverpool had called, and left word that his wife and children would be 
		provided for, he seemed but little affected; but, having requested pen, 
		ink and paper, he wrote the following letter to his wife:-</p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MY BLESSED MARY, -- <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It rejoiced me beyond measure to hear you are likely to be well 
		provided for. I am sure the public at large will participate in, and 
		mitigate, your sorrows; I assure you, my love, my sincerest endeavours 
		have ever been directed to your welfare. As we shall not meet any more 
		in this world, I sincerely hope we shall do so in the world to come. My 
		blessing to the boys, with kind remembrance to Miss Stephens, for whom I 
		have the greatest regard, in consequence of her uniform affection for 
		them. With the purest intentions, it has always been my misfortune to be 
		thwarted, misrepresented and ill-used in life; but however, we feel a 
		happy prospect of compensation in a speedy translation to life eternal. 
		It's not possible to be more calm or placid than I feel, and nine hours 
		more will waft me to those happy shores where bliss is without alloy.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours ever affectionate,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOHN BELLINGHAM. </p>
		<p align="justify">That the unfortunate man was afflicted with a strange 
		malady, which occasionally rendered him incapable of correct conclusions, 
		must be evident from the following note, which he wrote the night 
		preceding his execution: 'I lost my suit solely through the improper 
		conduct of my attorney and counsel, Mr Alley, in not bringing my 
		witnesses forward (of whom there were more an twenty): in consequence, 
		the judge took advantage of the circumstance, and I went on the defence 
		without having brought forward a single friend -- otherwise I must 
		inevitably have been acquitted.'</p>
		<p align="justify">On the Monday morning, at about six o'clock, he rose 
		and dressed himself with great composure, and read for half-an-hour in 
		the Prayer Book. Dr Ford being then announced, the prisoner shook him 
		most cordially by the hand, and left his cell for the room allotted for 
		the condemned criminals. He repeated the declaration which he had 
		frequently before made, that his mind was perfectly calm and composed 
		and that he was fully prepared to meet his fate with resignation. After 
		a few minutes spent in prayer, the sacrament was administered to him, 
		and during time whole of the ceremony he seemed to be deeply impressed 
		with the truths of the Christian religion, and repeatedly uttered some 
		pious ejaculations. After the religious ceremony was ended, the prisoner 
		was informed that the sheriffs were ready. He answered in a firm tone of 
		voice, 'I am perfectly ready also.'</p>
		<p align="justify">The executioner then proceeded to fasten his wrists 
		together, and the prisoner turned up the sleeves of his coat, and 
		clasped his hands together, presenting them to the man who held the cord, 
		and said, 'So.' When they were fastened, he desired his attendants to 
		pull down his sleeves so as to cover the cord. The officer then 
		proceeded to secure his arms behind him. When the man had finished, he 
		moved his hand upwards, as if to ascertain whether he could reach his 
		neck, and asked whether they thought his arms were sufficiently fastened, 
		saying that he might struggle, and that he wished to be so secured as to 
		prevent any inconvenience arising from it. He was answered that the cord 
		was quite secure, but he requested that it might be tightened a little, 
		which was accordingly done. During the whole of the awful scene he 
		appeared perfectly composed and collected: his voice never faltered, but 
		just before he left the room to proceed to the place of execution, he 
		stooped down his head and appeared to wipe away a tear. He was then 
		conducted by the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, under-sheriffs and officers (Dr 
		Ford walking with him) from the room, in which he had remained from the 
		time his irons were taken off; through the press-yard and time prison to 
		the fatal spot, before the Debtors' door at Newgate.</p>
		<p align="justify">He ascended the scaffold with rather a light step, a 
		cheerful countenance, and a confident, a calm, but not an exulting air. 
		He looked about him a little, lightly and rapidly, which seems to have 
		been his usual manner and gesture, but made no remark.</p>
		<p align="justify">Before the cap was put over his face, Dr Ford asked 
		if he had any last communication to make, or anything particular to say. 
		He was again proceeding to talk about Russia and his family, when Dr 
		Ford stopped him, calling his attention to the eternity into which he 
		was entering, and praying. Bellingham prayed also. The clergyman then 
		asked him how he felt, and he answered calmly and collectedly, that 'he 
		thanked God for having enabled him to meet his fate with so much 
		fortitude and resignation.' When the executioner proceeded to put the 
		cap over his face, Bellingham objected to it, and expressed a strong 
		wish that the business could be done without it; but Dr Ford said that 
		was not to be dispensed with. While the cap was being fastened on, it 
		being tied round the lower part of the face by the prisoner's 
		neckerchief, and just when he was tied up, about a score of persons in 
		the mob set up a loud and reiterated cry of 'God bless you!' 'God save 
		you!' This cry lasted while the cap was fastening n, and, though those 
		who raised it were loud and daring, it was joined in by but very few. 
		The ordinary asked Bellingham if he heard what the mob were saying. He 
		said he heard them crying out something, but he did not understand what 
		it was, and inquired what. The cry having by this time ceased, the 
		clergyman did not inform him what it was. The fastening on of the cap 
		being accomplished, the executioner retired and a perfect silence ensued. 
		Dr Ford continued praying for about a minute, while the executioner went 
		below the scaffold, and preparations were made to strike away its 
		supporters. The clock struck eight, and while was striking the seventh 
		time, the clergyman and Bellingham both fervently praying, the 
		supporters of the internal part of scaffold were struck away, and 
		Bellingham dropped out of sight down as far as the knees, his body being 
		in full view. The most perfect and awful silence prevailed; not even the 
		slightest attempt at a huzza or noise of any kind whatever was made.</p>
		<p align="justify">The body was afterwards carried in a cart, followed 
		by a crowd of the lower class, to St Bartholomew's Hospital, and 
		privately dissected.</p>
		<p align="justify">The greatest precautions were adopted to prevent 
		accidents among the crowd. A large bill was placarded at all the avenues 
		the Old Bailey, and carried about on a pole, to this effect: 'Beware of 
		entering the crowd! Remember thirty poor creatures pressed to death by 
		the crowd when Haggerty and Holloway were executed.' But no accident of 
		any moment occurred.</p>
		<p align="justify">To prevent any disposition to tumult, a military 
		force was stationed near Islington and to the south of Blackfriars 
		Bridge, and all the volunteer corps of the metropolis received 
		instructions to be under arms during the whole of the day.</p>

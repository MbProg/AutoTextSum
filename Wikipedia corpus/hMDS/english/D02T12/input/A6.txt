He was late.
As we later learn, John Bellingham was a man for whom things rarely went to plan.
However, he did kill the PM as he headed into the entrance lobby and was immediately seized.
I have to admit that I knew nothing about this crime, but the author recreates both the murder and the times with great detail in this fascinating account of the assassination of a British Prime Minister.
Spencer Perceval was Prime Minister during a turbulent time.
After the French Revolution, Napoleon was waging war in Europe.
A naval blockade had been imposed on France; the US and the French had their own embargos.
Trade worldwide had slowed to a trickle and there was economic recession, unemployment, social distress and the threat of war.
Perceval was a man of strong beliefs, who opposed the slave trade and believed in respectable public and private behaviour during the reign of a notoriously dissolute Prince Regent.
Happily married with many children, Perceval was respected by his peers and loved by his family.
This book looks at the aftermath of the assassination, how it was perceived in the country, the trial of Bellingham and his reasons for wanting to kill the PM.
We are taken from trading in Archangel, to slave traders in Liverpool, through the lives of both Bellingham and Perceval, examining who benefited from the removel of the Prime Minister, what motives there could be, looking at Luddites, radicals, Catholics and slave trade abolition along the way.
This really is a very well written, informative and interesting read, which examines the consequences of Perceval's death and finishes by telling us what happened to all the people involved in the events surrounding the assassination.
Lastly, I read the kindle edition of this book and the illustrations were included.

This is a particularly bad example of popular history.
Billing this as NEW research in UNDISCOVERED documents, it turns out that this is a reading of another popular historian's work, which was based on the ADD MSS 48216 in the British Library and hardly hidden from anyone.
Linklater insists that rather than being killed by a lone gunman with a grudge, John Bellingham was the patsy for a cabal of slave traders from Liverpool who didn't want the War of 1812 or Perceval's policies.

There were probably easier ways to get rid of a Prime Minister than a torturous plot, and a cursory understanding of British political or legal procedure is a good place to start before writing a book like this and finding every step in the convoluted process to be conspiracy proof.

That being said, the story is pretty amazing and the author makes some really interesting connections between what we know of the killing and what we perhaps should know, had people asked the right questions at the time.
Part of me feels this inquiry is just conjecture (using the legal term) based on very few pieces of evidence, but I guess that's what historians are supposed to do when working with few pieces of evidence!
Worth a read, but again not the easiest to piece together at times.

Perceval had deeply divided the British public.
Some loved him others hated him for his fight against the lucrative slave trade and driving Britain into a war with the United States despite the economic consequences to both countries.
Bellingham was not alone in blaming Perceval for economic ruin and he claimed to have killed Perceval "as a matter of justice," and believed he would not only be exonerated, but also applauded for his action.
But Bellingham was granted the briefest of trials that trampled his right to due process, he was hanged.
Author Andro Linklater examines the records including recently discovered correspondence and personal records to convincing show there was a conspiracy.
Linklater shows the prime ministers personal and public life and discusses the economic and political climate of the time.

Having never heard of Perceval, or of any assassination of a British PM, I thought it was a novel.
Halfway through reading this speculative history of Perceval’s murder, or more accurately, his assassin, I realized my first thought wasn’t far wide of the mark.
Perceval was shot point-blank in the chest and the assassin, John Bellingham, immediately took responsibility.
There was an inquiry, a committal, a trial and a hanging of the man who claimed sole responsibility for the murder - which he considered simply as an act of justice for himself.
Before the trial ended, the government was able to assure itself that their man was a lone wolf and not part of a wider political plot to bring down the government or foment a revolution.
Linklater casts doubt on their assessment.
Adopting a time-honored tradition, he follows the money, and the trail leads to.... Well, I’m not going to put in a spoiler except to say that his investigations lead us into the heart of the economic woes suffered by ordinary Britons, but especially traders, by the British government’s efforts - apparently hammered into place by Perceval’s obstinacy and religious beliefs - to control the Atlantic trade and, specifically, to uphold its bans on the slave trade.
Linklater presents a cogent theory that is spoiled, I think, by his novelistic techniques.
He gives us psycho-babble to explain Bellingham’s deluded thought process - Perceval’s murder was a “sublime” act à la the contemporary Romantic movement in art, architecture and poetry.
The assassin’s father was an artist and therefore this beauty versus the sublime dichotomy was embedded in his son’s psyche???
A serious s-t-r-e-t-c-h, and yet the author repeatedly refers to it.
He also casts a famous Bow Street runner as his surrogate detective.
Linklater suggests that had this brilliant man, one John Vickery, been given the brief he would have followed the same money trail that leads Linklater to his own slightly dodgy conclusions.
Linklater also comments that Bellingham’s timing was tragically off.
Had he “shot the Prime Minister in April, the news would have reached the United States in time to prevent the outbreak of war” in 1812.
Perhaps.
But given the complications of international diplomacy and national imperatives, perhaps not.
Amusing quote culled from Wikipedia:
A contemporary MP Henry Grattan, used a naval analogy to describe Perceval: "He is not a ship-of-the-line, but he carries many guns, is tight-built and is out in all weathers".

The narrative turns logic upside down and decides that because a scenario could have transpired it did happen, unless proof is shown that it did not.
Nevertheless, the book has indisputable and unalloyed benefit.
It sets out, as no other book I have read has done, an account not only of the parliamentary battles that led to the abolition of slavery but indeed of the practical steps that were required to give effect to the abolitionist's humane and 'providential fervour.
It also shows how a humourless and witless belief in predestination may have been responsible for the defeat of the peril that Napoleon constituted.
All told it is a book replete with arcane historical titbits but one that tells a weak story.
Nevertheless, well worth reading.

This is an odd book with entirely too much soul-gazing.
It's a superficial and sensational history of a complicated event, and in order to provide the necessary background, there's a lot of tension between the history and background (Orders in Council, slave trade, the politics that made Perceval PM) and conjecture and odd, sweeping statements.
The only British PM ever assassinated was poor Spencer Perceval, the family man, Evangelical-leaning Conservative stick-in-the-mud, on May 11, 1812.

As a fiction editor, point of view errors drive me crazy.
One place I never expect to see them is in a work of non-fiction.
I don't ever want to read that someone was a "typically stubborn, flinty-souled Yankee trader" because that's a judgment, not an observation.
(Also, that's my New England heritage being tossed around like a pejorative.)
Another statement -- "The conflict in John Bellingham's nature between the beautiful and the sublime became extreme" -- is not only ridiculous, it's all invention.
Who knows what Bellingham had in his nature?
In a work of non-fiction, I don't want to read conjecture.
I want to read history.
Facts.
Sources.
Not soul-gazing.
There were enough minor errors, like describing the Prince Regent's wife Caroline as an attractive woman (she wasn't), or describing American settlers as "moving onto the prairies" that I found myself doubting other recitations of facts.
The idea that Bellingham wasn't a lone shooter is intriguing.
If there's any real evidence for it, I didn't see it in this work.
It could be that by the time I reached the end, I was doubting the veracity of everything I was reading (unless a direct quote).
The potential for a very interesting book was here -- it would have required more research, better editing, and better weaving together of the facts, as well as toning down the grandiose value judgments.
I did learn some new things, and the notes were useful.
So there's that.
I'd probably give this 2.5 stars, but am rounding up to 3.

Maybe the author is right or maybe he's wrong about Bellingham's conspiracy.
It did seem odd that a man who's completely broke could afford to support two households, his own boarding room and his family's.

Perceval Spencer was trying to do a great thing by restricting the traffic of slaves (saving an estimated 40,000 a year) and was steeped in family values, he was a ruthless man when it came to his ideals.

Bellingham was also a bit strange, obsessed with his idea of justice.
A business trade had gone bad, how exactly did the British government owe him a hundred thousand pounds?
Bellingham and Spencer were much the same -- dedicated to do what they felt was right.

It was interesting to have the event and Bellingham's background put into the historical context of the war with Napoleon and approaching war with the US, and also the anti-slavery movement and I really liked the way it tied all those events together.
As a narrative though I found my interest came and went.
It didn't really hold me the whole way through and I found it easy to put it down.

Linklater's narrative often goes rambling through dark alleys in an attempt to build a case, but he absolutely fails to bring things together even at the most basic level of explaining what the conspirators are supposed to have done.

Pretty good book.
It outlines the assassination of Britain's Prime Minister in 1812, who remains to date the only British PM ever to be assassinated and with luck, will remain so.
At any rate, Linklater examines the assassination in great detail and comes up with a really intriguing theory as to the motives behind Perceval's murder, beyond the ones stated by his killer, John Bellingham.
He links it pretty inexorably to the War of 1812.

Reading this book left me hungry for more.
Of what I wasn't sure, but I wanted Linklater's depth, humor, sensitivity brought to every major event in history.
If this is what he can do with the reasonably sut-and-dry history of Spencer Perceval's death then I am left to only imagine what he could do with any of the other mysteries of history.
Also, Spencer Perceval sounds like a jerk.
Just had to mention that.
Linklater is very kind to the man so I have to get that information out somewhere.

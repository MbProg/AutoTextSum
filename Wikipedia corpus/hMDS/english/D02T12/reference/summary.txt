Spencer Perceval, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, was shot and killed in the lobby of the House of Commons in London, at about 5:15 pm on Monday 11 May 1812.
His assailant was John Bellingham, a Liverpool merchant with a grievance against the government.
Bellingham was detained and, four days after the murder, was tried, convicted and sentenced to death.
He was hanged at Newgate Prison on 18 May 1812.

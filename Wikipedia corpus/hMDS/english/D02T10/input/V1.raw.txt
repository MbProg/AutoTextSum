Holidays in Egypt
 
Taking  your holidays in Egypt is the best value for money and you get a chance to  experience and see 7,000 years of history and civilization.
 
Taking  a moment to realize that Egypt is more than 7,000 years old   and was home to one  of the best documented civilizations of the world,   is breath taking on its own.  Across the centuries and millennia there   have been numerous cultures and peoples who have lived in Egypt and   ruled it too. The result of that nowadays,  are the leftover monuments   and memoirs representing cultural diversity, human  life and survival   through it all.
 
Egypt’s  location, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea from its northern tip and the Red  Sea from its eastern side, with the river Nile splitting it down the middle,  gives Egypt a striking and strategic   position. You can say it is in the center  of the world and is the   cradle of civilization. This location ensures Egypt’s  wide selection   and variety of beaches, resorts and cities by the river, making  your   holiday in Egypt an unforgettable one.
 
Starting  by telling you about Egypt’s capital and the biggest city in Africa only makes  sense. Cairo is home to 17  million people and attracts professionals, families and   young vibrant students  from all over the world looking to learn Arabic   or immerse themselves in  Egyptian culture. This multicultural city,   spread over on either side of the  Nile, is home to Pharaonic , Islamic and Coptic  monuments as well as statues and streets from the turn of the century and  the   Ottoman Empire. Downtown and Zamalek districts are famous for their   beautiful European style architecture, giving  downtown Cairo the title   of “Paris along the Nile”. Cairo is a vibrant city  that never sleeps   full of restaurants, cafes and food stands. Walking through  the crowds   of people, cars and microbuses and embracing the randomness of the  city   is one of the most interesting experiences some come to find. Outside    of Cairo, people also enjoy taking a daytrip to Fayoum to see the oasis and the  beautiful lakes along with waterfalls and natural scenery.

<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impressive towers and broad
moat of Bodiam Castle are like a scene from a fantasy as you gaze at them
for the very first time. At a quick glance it appears to be the very epitome
of a medieval castle, until closer inspection is given. One soon discovers
that it was built at an evolutionary stage when the Nobility were looking
for more comfortable, agreeable places to live that offered them security,
but also represented an outward show of their wealth and rank. Comparatively
few of its type were built and it should be more accurately described as
a Courtyard Castle. Castles built in this period were the last true castles
to be built in England, they provided security and also separate suites
of rooms for the Lord, his domestic staff, guests and garrison.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Edward III signed the treaty
of Bretigny in 1360 he renounced his claim to the Crown of France whilst
retaining Aquitaine, Calais and other important provinces. He was unable,
and perhaps not too bothered, about evacuating his forces from the remainder
of France, and these men soon banded together. This was the time of the
'Free Companies' or 'Routiers', private mercenary armies who would normally
be under the control of the King but who now sold their services to the
highest bidder. They indulged in looting and destruction on an appalling
scale with many men gaining great wealth and notoriety from such expeditions.</font></td>

<td><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time in the history
of the Hundred Years War, there was a rise in the more professional soldier.
The leadership in the field was being handed down to the lesser nobility
and many took this opportunity to gain influence and great wealth. Men
such as Bertrand du Guesclin, Sir Thomas Dagworth, Sir Robert Knolles and
Sir Hugh Calveley all became commanders of the so called 'Free Companies',
acting sometimes with the blessing of their King and sometimes without,
but all the time causing havoc and destruction wherever they operated in
France.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was under the command of Robert
Knolles that the builder of Bodiam Castle built his reputation and wealth.
Sir Edward Dalyngrigge was something of a character in his day, he belonged
to an old established Sussex family who came from present day Dalling Ridge,
near East Grinstead, but returned from France in 1377 much more wealthier
and powerful. It was after he married Elizabeth Wardeux he came into possession
of the Manor of Bodiam in 1378</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This manor house was not where
the present Castle stands, but to the North of Bodiam Church in the adjacent
valley of the Kent ditch. The site was excavated in the 60's and 70's and
pottery finds indicated it was in use from the late 13th century until
the building of the Castle. The Wardeux family had acquired the manor by
marriage to the de Bodeham family, who had held it since the conquest when
it was given to Hugh of Eu. He gave it to his son who took the name de
Bodeham from the name of the Saxon settlement on the site.</font></td>

<td><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Edward Dalyngrigge
was a Knight for the Shire of Sussex for 10 Parliments between 1379 and
1388 and was without doubt one of the most powerful men in Sussex at this
time, along with his Patron the Earl of Arundel. England at the end of
the 14th century was seriously under threat of invasion from the French;
the victories of Crecy and Poitiers were a distant memory as the French
slowly clawed back her possessions. Piracy was rife in the channel and
in 1377 Rye and Winchelsea were both sacked and burned. In 1380 Dalyngrigge
was part of a Kings commission to consider the state of the country, its
possessions and expenses of the Royal Household. In the same year he was
also appointed to survey the town of Winchelsea and consider how it may
be fortified against the French. This was of great importance to Dalyngrigge
as his manor was about 14 miles upstream from Winchelsea on the River Rother
and could easily be reached by more raiding parties. He was probably more
guilty of piracy and pillage in the past than the French raiders he was
commanded to keep out! Hastings was also attacked soon after and in answer
to this on 21 October 1385, Dalyngrigge was given licence to
<b>;</b></font>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#353535"><font size=+1>"Crenellate his house to protect
the inland reaches of the Rother and halt the French advances"</font></font></b></center>

<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time many castles
and manor houses were either rebuilt of fortified such as Cooling Castle
and Scotney Castle to counter any invasion. Dalyngrigge combined the best
features of these together with those he had first hand experience of in
France to build Bodiam. He was unlikely to have been at Bodiam during the
initial stages of building, as he was appointed Captain of the French port
of Brest between 1386-87. By 1390 the threat of invasion had receded and
Sir Edward was appointed to several commissions, one to conclude a truce
with the King of France and another to survey the Castles and fortresses
of Calais and Picardy. In the same year he was one of nine Knights who
put their Seal to a letter to the Pope deploring the excesses of the Church.
In 1395 he was to further improve his status when appointed by the King
as Keeper of the Tower of London and Governor of the City. Dalyngrigge
was no doubt living in his newly built Castle by this time, but wasn't
to enjoy it for long. He died in 1395 and was succeeded by his son, Sir
John Dalyngrigge.</font></td>

<td><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The information we have on the
early life of Bodiam is rather obscure and what information we do have
is largely thanks to Lord Curzon . He brought together all the information
for the first time in his book " Bodiam Castle" published in 1926, and
it is thanks to his excellent research that we know what we do of the castle
today.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The castle was to remain in the
Dalyngrigge family until 1483 when it came to another famous Sussex family,
The Lewknors by marriage. Sir Thomas Lewknor was a Lancastrian and was
attainted by Richard III. The King issued a commission in 1483 to the Earl
of Surrey and other loyal Nobles, authorizing them<b>;</b></font>
<center>
<p><b><font size=+1>'
<font color="#383838">To levy the men in the Counties
of Kent and Sussex to besiege the Castle of Bodyham which the rebels have
seized.</font>'</font></b></center>

<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The castle was given up without
a struggle and no damage was done to its walls. After Bosworth, the castle
was again back in the hands of the Lewknors and passed to several minor
heirs of the family.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the civil war
it was in the hands of John Hufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet. He was a staunch
Royalist but in 1644 he sold it to Sir Nathaniel Powel, a Parliamentarian.
It does not appear to have been actively involved in the war or dismantled
by General Waller in 1643 as has been suggested. There is no damage to
any of the exterior walls and shows no sign of bombardment, the only damage
visible is in the interior.</font></td>

<td><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Castle was only inhabited
again during a brief period in the 18th Century when a small cottage was
erected inside, by the Postern Tower. The Castle suffered from the usual
pilfering of stone and slowly turned into the ivy clad ruin the mid 18th
century drawings and paintings show.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A local Squire from Brightling,
John 'Mad Jack' Fuller, rescued the Castle in 1815. The Castle was going
to be dismantled when Fuller paid &pound;3000 to save it from destruction.
Fuller was a huge, fat man who was an MP for many years in Sussex. He was
thrown out of Parliament on several occasions for his unruly behavior,
and many of his follies litter the landscape around Brightling. A very
popular man locally, he did a lot for the poor, a whole book has been written
on his exploits. His grave, or rather, Pyramid is 25ft tall and stands
in the lovely Churchyard at Brightling. It is said that he is buried in
the centre, sitting in his favorite chair, wearing top hat and tails with
a bottle of his best Claret and a cooked chicken! Dalyngrigge would, I'm
certain have approved. The Castle was sold again in 1864 by Fuller's grandson
for &pound;5000 to Lord Ashcombe, who undertook many vital repairs over
the next 40 years.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Curzon first saw Bodiam
in 1905 while Warden of the Cinque Ports and immediately fell in love with
it. It wasn't until 1916 that he was able to negotiate its sale. His wife
tells that after his first visit he returned and proposed to her in the
beautiful setting of Winchelsea Church. Curzon embarked on a grand programme
of research and restoration with his Architect William Weir and it is thanks
to him that we can all enjoy this beautiful castle today. He left it in
his will to

<p><b><u><font face="Manuscript"><font color="#4F4F4F"><font size=+3>Bodiam
Castle</font></font></font></u></b></center>

<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Castle has excellent car
parking facilities and can be also reached by a No 349 Bus from Hastings
Station. Nearest Railway station is Robertsbridge&nbsp; ( 5miles ).</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Castle entrance is 1/4 mile
walk from the Car park but special arrangements for people with disabilities
can take them to the entrance. There is wheelchair access to the Castle
but not the Towers. Dogs are permitted on the site but not allowed in the
Castle. Picnics are welcome to be taken in the grounds but not in the castle.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodiam Castle is one of the most
famous and evocative in Britain and is probably the most ideal for a visit
with children. An excellent Guidebook is available on the castle and its
history along with many gifts and books for children in a well-stocked
shop. There is also has a very reasonable restaurant alongside although
these are only open from February until the end of October.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Castle and grounds can get
very busy during the School holidays and summer months but a visit with
entry just before 5 O'clock, as they lock the gates, on a summer evening
is well worth it. It ensures you are locked in with a closing time to be
out at 6. (A castle to yourself for an hour). Winter is not so busy and
a visit on a fine, crisp, winters day can be a very rewarding. Although
the exterior is in excellent condition some may find the interior a little
disappointing, for these people, I leave you with the words of Lord Curzon:</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Exchequer Script"><font size=+2>"<font color="#282828">At
Bodiam, not only does the watery cincture remain, but no trace of the modern
world appears to invade the ancient and solitary beauty of the scene. It
could hardly surprise anyone, were a train of richly clad Knights, falcons
on their wrists, and their ladies mounted on gaily caparisoned palfreys,
suddenly emerge from the Barbican Gate, for the enjoyment of the chase.
Or even the flash of spearheads and the clatter of iron-shod hooves to
indicate the exit of a party with more serious intent.</font>"</font></font></b></center>

Bodiam Castle
Overview

Archetypal 14th century moated castle with ruined interior - a glimpse of medieval splendour
Set in the heart of an historic landscape, with spiral staircases, battlements and a portcullis, 14th century Bodiam Castle is one of Britain's most picturesque and romantic ancient monuments.
Windows where arrows were once shot, a tower that was once a look-out and ruins that were once walked upon by knights; this is a place where you can relive your childhood memories and let your imagination run riot.
In the impressive gatehouse is the castle's original wooden portcullis, an extremely rare example of its kind.
Enough of the interior ruins survive to give an impression of castle life and gruesome and surprising tales can often be heard from our brewster, forester and other colourful characters from the past.
Plus we have lots of seasonal events throughout the year.
Please note: Entry to the grounds is included in our admission prices.
Tickets must be purchased to enter the castle and/or the grounds.

What is Gift Aid?
Most of our places run the Gift Aid on Entry scheme at their admission points.
Under this scheme, if you're not a member you have the choice of two entry tickets:
Gift Aid Admission or
Standard admission
If the place runs Gift Aid on Entry, we'll offer you the Gift Aid Admission prices.
But it's entirely up to you which ticket you choose.
If you want the Standard Admission instead, just let us know when you come to pay.
Gift Aid Admission includes a 10 per cent or more voluntary donation.
Gift Aid Admissions let us reclaim tax on the whole amount paid* — an extra 25 per cent — potentially a very significant boost to our places' funds.
An extra £1 paid under the scheme can be worth over £3 to the National Trust as shown below: Payment of the additional percentage donation is entirely voluntary, so if you prefer to pay the standard admission please advise our reception staff at the till point.

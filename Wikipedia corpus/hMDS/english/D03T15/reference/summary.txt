Ian Tomlinson (7 February 1962 â€“ 1 April 2009) was a newspaper vendor who collapsed and died in the City of London after being struck by a police officer during the 2009 G-20 summit protests.
An inquest found that he had been unlawfully killed by the officer, Simon Harwood, a constable with London's Metropolitan Police Service.
Harwood was later found not guilty of manslaughter, but was dismissed from the police service for gross misconduct.

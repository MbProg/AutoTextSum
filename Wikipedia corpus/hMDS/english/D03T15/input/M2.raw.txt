Death at G20 UK newspaper coverage of the G20 demonstrations (1 April 2009) and the death of Ian Tomlinson
Slide 2
Initial tabloid reports of the violent outbreaks during the G20 protests make their ideological agendas quite clear. http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2354088.ece

The Mail, ever the dutiful citizens, even went as far as to reveal the true extent of the UK's descent into anarchic lawlessness. “ A group calling itself the Whitechapel Anarchist Group - or WAG - is using the ramshackle building as its 'war den', where tales of violence against the police and capitalist buildings are swapped.” http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1166549/Undercover-anarchist-mob-How-Mail-infiltrated-group-heart-violence.html

Activity: Initial reports of Tomlinson's death I'll give out five different newspaper reports of the death of Ian Tomlinson at the G2o demonstrations in London. Work in a group, look at one of the reports, and consider the following questions: What facts are given about the death? What circumstances led to the death? What was the role of the police in the last few moments of Tomlinson's life? Then work with another group and consider what similarities and differences there are between the reports: the facts reported, the wording used and the impression given of the different groups involved.

Activity: Initial reports of Tomlinson's death The reports: http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/04/02/man-dies-in-g20-protests-115875-21247134/ http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/man-dies-after-being-caught-among-the-mob-in-city-riots-1696746.html http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1166819/Pictured-The-man-died-G20-violence-returned-home-work.html http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/02/g20-summit-protester-death

Notice in particular, the following quotes from four of the initial reports. EVENING STANDARD: “Police came under a barrage of missiles as they tried to save the life of a man who collapsed during the G20 protests in the City. The officers were hit by bottles thrown from the crowd as they were forced to carry the man to a safe location to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.” MIRROR: “As police officers tried in vain to revive the man they were pelted with bottles by a screaming mob. They dragged him behind a police cordon so paramedics could get him into an ambulance.” INDEPENDENT: “Police said that as they tried to give the casualty urgent treatment, they had to carry him away from the area after bottles were thrown at them by protesters.” MAIL: “Unconscious, he had to be moved by police for urgent treatment after protestors pelted officers with missiles as they attempted to give first aid to Mr Tomlinson.”

However, despite this widespread agreement concerning the cause of death and the conduct of the police, when the Guardian published this video it became clear that the story was not entirely accurate.
Slide 9
So how can such inaccurate reporting be explained? The answer lies in the source of the reports’ information: the Police Press Office. This report in the Guardian considers the how the Police PR techniques. http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/apr/09/g20-police-assault-ian-tomlinson-g20 Incidentally, the initial Guardian report was more sceptical of the official version than the other four: “Jackson said Mr Tomlison was then surrounded by police officers who were pelted with at least one missile. "There were a couple of people throwing bottles in that general direction," he said. "But they were told to stop doing that by the crowd. In fact, some people in the crowd threatened to kill them if they did anything to disrupt the treatment."”

In a final twist to the story, you’ll need to cast your minds back to the first article we looked at from The Sun. You might recall this:

The Sun weren’t the only newspaper interested in this epitome of lawless irresponsibility. Here are images from two separate Mail reports:

But yet again it appears all is not as it seems. Incidentally, on the day this story broke in the Guardian, I couldn’t find any reference to this court case, or indeed Harvie Brown, in any other newspaper. There were however many reports on various blogs, and one on the pages of Brown's lawyers: http://www.bindmans.com/index.php?id=751

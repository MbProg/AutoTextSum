Re: Good Morning...Columbine
Just did a google on school shootings.
Not sure if this is accurate or Not.
But from lookin at it I think its safe to assume that TeeVee and Violent Video games are a big part of the problem.
A brief history of school shootings
April 20, 2007 — admin
This list below is from the Wikipedia page – School Shooting – what I notice is that school shootings are a fairly recent phenomenon (late 1980s/early 1990s onwards) and they do seem to happen mainly in the USA.
OK, so this is not a scientific survey by any means, but doesn’t this list make you stop and think?

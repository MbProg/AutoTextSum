ANNIVERSARY... ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE MASSACRE
Doubt this news ever made it down to the states, but today is the 17th anniversary of the montreal ecole polytechnique massacre. It was on Dec. 6, 1989, that Lepine went on a shooting rampage, killing 14 women at the engineering school. 
A sobering memory for the day.

anniversary... Ecole polytechnique massacre
Doubt this news ever made it down to the states, but today is the 17th anniversary of the montreal ecole polytechnique massacre.
It was on Dec. 6, 1989, that Lepine went on a shooting rampage, killing 14 women at the engineering school.
A sobering memory for the day.

Thanks for the reminder.
I thought about it yesterday, but for some reason it wasn't on my mind this morning.

Ceremonies will be held across Canada Wednesday to mark the 17th anniversary of the day 14 women were shot dead at a Montreal school.
École Polytechnique shooting victims:
Annie Saint-Arnault
Annie Turcotte
On Dec. 6, 1989, Marc Lépine burst into a classroom at Montreal's École Polytechnique, ordered the men outside and opened fire on the women left behind.
Thirteen engineering students and one employee were killed before the attacker turned the gun on himself.
Police later found an anti-feminist manifesto and a hit list on the man's body.
The massacre became a lightning rod for the movement to eradicate violence against women, and catalyzed the gun control lobby in Canada.
Dec. 6 was named Canada's National Day of Commemoration and Action on Violence Against Women in 1991.
In Montreal, a vigil will be held at 10 a.m. ET at the corner of Decelles and Queen Mary Road.

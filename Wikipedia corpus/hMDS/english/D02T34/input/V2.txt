Good Morning...Columbine
April 20, 1999: Columbine High School Murders
12 years ago, on this day in 1999, two teenagers kill 13 people in a shooting spree at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, south of Denver.
At approximately 11:19 a.m., Dylan Klebold, 18, and Eric Harris, 17, dressed in trench coats, began shooting students outside the school before moving inside to continue their rampage.
By 11:35 a.m., Klebold and Harris had killed 12 fellow students and a teacher and wounded another 23 people.
Shortly after noon, the two teenaged sociopaths turned their guns on themselves and committed suicide.
The crime was the worst school shooting in U.S. history (until 33 people, including the gunman, were killed in the Virginia Tech shooting on April 16, 2007) and prompted a national debate on gun control and school safety, as well as a major investigation to determine what motivated the teen gunmen.
Investigations eventually determined that Harris and Klebold chose their victims randomly.
Their original plan was for two propane bombs to explode in the school's cafeteria, potentially killing hundreds of people and forcing the survivors outside and into the gunmen's line of fire.
When the bombs didn't work, Harris and Klebold went into the school to carry out their murderous rampage.
There was speculation that Harris and Klebold committed the killings because they were members of a group of social outcasts called the "Trenchcoat Mafia" that was fascinated by Goth culture.
Violent video games and music were also blamed for influencing the killers.
However, none of these theories was ever proven.
Columbine High School reopened in the fall of 1999, but the massacre left a scar on the Littleton community.
Mark Manes, the man who sold a gun to Harris and bought him 100 rounds of ammunition the day before the murders, was sentenced to six years in prison.
In the aftermath of the Columbine shootings, many schools enacted "zero tolerance" rules regarding disruptive behavior and threats of violence from students.
"Discourage litigation.
Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever they can.
Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser; in fees, expenses and waste of time."
-- Abraham Lincoln, (1809-1865) Lawyer and President who saved the United States.
"Without opportunities on the part of the poor to obtain expert legal advice, it is idle to talk of equality before the law"-- Justice Chas.

Re: Good Morning...Columbine
This is the 12th anniversary of these two rotting in hell.
Kinda gives me a warm fuzzy feeling thinking of it.
Hopefully the others are all enjoying their 12th year in paradise.
I can't believe some of these kids would now be 30 years old...

Re: Good Morning...Columbine
Just did a google on school shootings.
Not sure if this is accurate or Not.
But from lookin at it I think its safe to assume that TeeVee and Violent Video games are a big part of the problem.

Re: Good Morning...Columbine
Dave Cullen's bestseller about Columbine from a couple of years ago is an interesting read.
Examination of Eric Harris's writings strong suggested he was a budding serial rapist and murderer, according to psychologists.
His diary entries fantasized about kidnapping, torturing, raping, and killling women.
The depths of his psychopathy and sadism will never be known.
Klebold was the weaker one, the follower who probably would never have done the killings but for Harris's influence on him.
I also think Harris's parents are culpable.
There were way too many behavioral problems and other signs of serious problems which no attentive parent could miss.
The first victim, cute Rachel Scott, apparently had a premonition she would not survive that past that year.
She was a devout Christian, so that is food for thought for non-believers.

Re: Good Morning...Columbine
Lest we forget - parents and teachers need to be vigilant (not PC)!
(Got a D-I-L that was raised by her mother who wanted to be her "friend"; and the sin of the mother was passed along to the first child - a disaster x2!)
How can there be too many children?
That is like saying there are too many flowers.

Or the military.
IMO, the only way violent video games are responsible is if they tip an already unstable mind.
If you know right from wrong, this isn't a problem.

Their original plan was beyond sick.
They planned for the explosives in the cafeteria to go off, which would have killed hundreds of students.
Then they would position themselves to pick off escaping students with their guns.
But the explosives did not detonate.
Their victims were killed early on and at the very end in the school library.
They did a lot of searching in between but did not find many targets.
Harris was a young Ted Bundy who liked guns and explosives.

Re: Good Morning...Columbine
This really is a week filled with the anniversaries of tragedies, isn't it?
The thing that I remember most about Columbine was the misconceptions about music and video games that grew out of it... that they did it because they listened to Marilyn Manson.
That part was true, but there were also a few other misconceptions, like them creating a level on Doom 2 based on the school, so that it was like they were simulating shooting up the school on their computer.
Then, about five years ago, a game called "Bully" came out from the creators of Rockstar, which notorious anti-vidya lawyer (who has since been disbarred) Jack Thompson called a "Columbine simulator."
I've played it, it wasn't.
There were no guns, other than a potato gun used by the evil nerd boss.
In any event, one of my high school teachers shared the advice that she gave her elementary school daughter: Be nice to everyone in school.
Really nice.
No matter what.
Don't bully, don't tease, don't be mean or heartless or exclude others or bring them to tears.
Be nice to EVERYone.

Just said that TeeVee and Video Games contributed to this.
Granted  the Games and such may have just Tipped an unstable mind, But they also could have helped CREATE said Unstable mind

They did it simply because Eric Harris was a highly disturbed psychopath with violent tendencies and poor impulse control, and Dylan Klebold was a disturbed and weak follower.
Enough said.
Sadly, the first victim Rachel Scott was as sweet to her classmates as anyone.
She liked to befriend unpopular students and even agreed to go to a prom with a handicapped student.
Unfortunately for her, being nice or good meant nothing to the heartless.

The Massacre of Women at the École Polytechnique: An essay
The text below was written by a dear friend of mine, Elisabeth Harrison for her The History of Feminism in Canada class.
A compelling piece of work, written at such a higher level than most second year university students.
I have been given permission from Ms. Harrison to post this essay on my blog.
The Massacre of Women
at the École Polytechnique, December 6 1989:
The Event, its Construction, and Feminist Responses
The events of December 6, 1989 at the engineering school of the Université de Montréal, the mass murder of 14 women which was committed by one man, is commonly referred to as the  “Montreal Massacre.”
It is an event which has come to shape Canadian understandings of violence against women.
A feminist analysis reveals that the massacre is only one instance of a more universal function of patriarchal oppression – Misogynous violence is a force which affects all women everywhere, but to different extents and in different ways.
However, it was only after a significant period of time had elapsed that feminist interpretations of the December 6 massacre came to be privileged in mainstream understandings of it.
Contemporarily, its misogynous nature was systematically denied and hidden in media coverage.
In media, discourses of incomprehensibility, madness, technical aspects and apolitical sorrow were foregrounded, and those interpretations which criticised the dominant discourses were vociferously denounced.
I will examine the events of December 6, focussing particularly on the manner in which the event was shaped through coverage by media.
Next, I will outline feminist responses to the massacre of women, focussing on remembrance, resistance and organising for change.
December 6, 1989 was the second to last day of fall term classes at the École Polytechnique, the engineering school of the Université de Montréal.
Interrupting a student presentation, a man armed with a semi-automatic rifle[1] entered a classroom.
He demanded that the male and female students move to opposite corners of the room, and then that the men leave.
They complied, and once they were gone, the man announced to the women that he was “here to fight against feminism.”
One woman protested that they were not feminists, so he should not shoot them.
He refused this: “You’re women, you’re going to be engineers.
You’re all a bunch of feminists.
I hate feminists,” and shot six women to death.
[2] Immediately prior to this, he had shot, stabbed and killed women in a first floor cafeteria, and in the hallways of the building.
[3] Thirteen women died of gunshot wounds and one was stabbed to death.
These are the names of the 14 women: Geneviève Bergeron, Hélène Colgan, Nathalie Croteau, Barbara Daigneault, Anne-Marie Edward, Maud Haviernick, Barbara Maria Klucznik, Maryse Laganière, Maryse Leclair, Anne-Marie Lemay, Sonia Pelletier, Michèle Richard, Annie St-Arneault and Annie Turcotte.
[4] Nine other women and four men were wounded in the massacre, but survived.
[5] The sole male casualty was Marc Lépine, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, having just committed mass femicide.
Sylvie Gagnon, a survivor of the massacre, speaking about her experience in the film After the Montreal Massacre, says, “I heard the shot, I heard the scream.”
The woman beside her fell to the ground, wounded.
She continues:
I felt my ear burning He walked between us, and shot her again – point blank It was only when I got out that I touched my hair and realised I was wounded and bleeding I was afraid people would think I was completely crazy and wouldn’t believe me.
To validate it I had to refer to TV so people would believe me.
I saw the full story on TV at the same time as everyone.
[6]
In The Montreal Massacre: A Story of Membership Categorization Analysis, Peter Eglin and Stephen Hester write:
The Montreal Massacre provides a particularly perspicuous case of how social phenomena are inseparable from, and in a sense, constituted by, the ways in which they are described and analyzed, that is, made accountable in media reportage and commentary.
[7]
Our cultural reliance on mediated explanations of events is highlighted in the quotation from Gagnon.
Therefore it is extremely significant that feminist analysis of media coverage of (and responses to) the massacre demonstrate that the “full story” was not presented to the public.
For example, the police and the press were extremely resistant to uttering the truth that every one of the casualties was female, instead describing the victims as genderless “persons.”
[8] On the CBC evening news, Barbara Frum upheld the desexing of the event, asking, “Isn’t our common humanity diminished by any such multiple murder, any such monstrous crime?
Why do we diminish it by saying it was an act against any one group, isn’t it against all of our humanity?”
[9]
Similar processes of hiding gendered analyses have been noted in relation to the American (and Canadian) “school shootings” which became increasingly common across the 1990s and into the present decade.
Writing in Off Our Backs: A Women’s Newsjournal, Carolyn Gage criticises Michael Moore’s popular film, Bowling for Columbine, noting that although the problem of gun control which Moore makes the centre of his analysis of “school violence” is important, the fact that every perpetrator of a school shooting has been male is also extremely significant, but is completely ignored by Moore.
(This point is further developed in Sut Jhally’s film Tough Guise: Media Images and the Crisis in Masculinity, which examines how nearly all media have constructed violent acts involving guns in school settings as a genderless issue.)
[10] Gage writes that while Moore envisions Canada as a gun violence-free utopia, his view is directly contradicted by the December 6 massacre of women – an explicitly misogynous school shooting.
[11]
Lépine’s suicide note was withheld from the public by the police until late 1990, when it was published in La Presse.
[12] The note specified Lépine’s intention to “send the feminists, who have always ruined [his] life, to their Maker.”
To his letter, Lépine appended a list of 19 prominent “feminists” he would have killed, had he not “started too late.”
[13] Québécoise feminist journalist Francine Pelletier (who is one of the women on Lépine’s hit-list)[14]  describes that it was only after the events of December 6 that she saw the “huge chasm” between women and men, when the editors of the newspaper for which she worked refused to publish her column, for the reason that it was feminist, and therefore anti-male.
[15]
Discourses employed in media to make sense of the massacre were extremely hostile to feminist interpretations of it: It was first described as an incomprehensible and senseless isolated incident;[16] next as the act of a mad killer; then as the response of a traumatised victim to forces outside of his control, when Lépine’s childhood abuse at the hands of his father – from whom Lépine had learned violence, patriarchal ideology and misogyny – was revealed.
[17] Many such stories were extremely sympathetic to the murderer – as were many of the letters published on editorial pages.
[18]
While the views of those who sympathised with Lépine as a victim of abuse, both at the hands of his father and at the hands of “the feminists” were published in newspapers (ie: “And the killer, he too was our son,”[19] ), letters advocating feminist understandings of and responses to the massacre – as were other feminist responses – subjected to extremely harsh criticism.
Those who advocated feminist understandings of the massacre were often accused of attempting to capitalise on the event,[20] as though they viewed it as an excellent public relations opportunity, rather than a horrific incident of misogynous violence.
In reports of the mass murder, the technical aspects of it were highlighted: Videogame-like graphics were used to illustrate Lépine’s rampage through the school; the specific type of rifle he used was examined in great detail.
[21] One of the most famous images to come out of the event is of a dead woman, slumped in her chair, a pool of blood beneath her.
Such an image reveals nothing about the massacre that was not already known, but does invade the privacy of the woman, her family and her friends – who did recognise her in the photograph.
[22]
Even the way in which the December 6 mass murder of women is named reveals a resistance to specifying it as an act of misogyny: “The Montreal Massacre” has come to be the most common way to refer to it.
This appellation overemphasises one of the less important aspects of the event, the city in which it occurred.
More accurate terminology for it is suggested by Sharon Rosenberg, who advocates the use of the phrases: “anti-feminist massacre,” “murder of women,” and “killing of university women.”
[23] Each of these phrases describes characteristics that are relevant to the event’s meaning, enabling a better understanding of it as a violent act against women who threatened the patriarchal order by engaging in a non-traditional educational path.
Feminist responses to the massacre were, of course, immediate, but, as I have shown, largely ignored or denounced outright in mainstream media.
Both at the time of the massacre and today, there have been three streams of feminist response: Remembrance, resistance and organising for change.
Remembrance of the victims of the December 6 massacre of women has taken many forms.
The women who were killed are memorialised in poetry, song, and art.
There are frequent references to the massacre, particularly on its anniversary.
Teaching about the meaning of the massacre of women represents a significant way in which the victims are memorialised, and meanings are constructed around the event.
In “Educating the Living, Remembering the Dead: The Montreal Massacre as Metaphor,” Jennifer Scanlon explains her practice of introducing students to the massacre as a metaphor through which the wider problem of violence against women can be understood.
For Scanlon, the massacre is “part of a continuum of violence and hatred rather than an aberration that will never be repeated.”
[24]
The remembrance practice most closely associated with the massacre is the vigil.
For very specific reasons, it is promoted as the most appropriate response.
On its website, Status of Women Canada writes:
Did you know that December 6 is the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women in Canada?
Established in 1991 by the Parliament of Canada, this day coincides with the sad anniversary of the death of fourteen young women who were tragically killed on December 6, 1989 at l’École Polytechnique de Montréal because of their gender.
[25]
The massacre is “sad,” the women “were tragically killed” (by whom or what is obscured).
The only appropriate response to this is to be respectful and quiet.
On the same website, Status of Women advocates holding candlelight vigils, sending commemorative e-mail messages to friends, colleagues and family members, and ordering and displaying the poster produced by Status of Women (which reads: “December 6: National Day of  Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women” in sombre white lettering against a black background, alongside a single dark red rose – a symbol of mourning, not of action).
The only direct action suggested is to volunteer at and fundraise for women’s shelters.
[26] Though such activity is extremely valuable, I argue that it does not directly challenge the root cause of violence against women: the patriarchal social order.
[27]
Further, as Scanlon points out, the fact of the December 6 massacre of women being taken up by the Canadian government as the dominant symbol of violence against women is tied to the murdered women’s social location: They were white, and they were regarded as having been in “a position associated with opportunity,”[28] as students of engineering.
According to the Native Women’s Association of Canada, from 1985 to 2005, approximately 500 First Nations women have “disappeared.”
Many, if not most, of these women are likely to have been killed.
However, there has been no governmental response to the crisis of violence against First Nations women, whom government statistics show to be five times more likely to die as a result of violence than are non-First Nations women.
[29] From the standpoint of representation, this is extremely problematic.
An immediate response to the massacre was to organise and participate in processions through the streets of Montreal.
At one such event, a group of women who tried to address the crowd were stopped from doing so by the male organisers of the event, who insisted on characterising the massacre as isolated and “incomprehensible.”
Similarly, at another procession, silence was enforced by the organisers, who confiscated sound equipment from women who had planned on speaking to those assembled.
[30] It is much easier to ignore silent and compliant mourners than angry and vocal protestors.
While vigils do serve the purpose of enabling remembrance and reflection, they cannot substitute for action directed toward the elimination of violence against women.
Acts of resistance are the second stream of feminist response to the massacre.
The primary example of such is to name the massacre as an act of misogyny, and to draw connections from it to other such misogynous acts.
Sexism in engineering schools across Canada came under feminist scrutiny for the first time: the École Polytechnique’s annual “Lady Godiva Ride,” wherein a sex worker was hired to ride a horse across campus while naked was no longer seen as harmless fun.
In light of the massacre, the sexist tradition was eliminated.
[31] In January of 1990 (less than a month after the massacre of women at the École Polytechnique), at the University of Alberta, Celeste Brosseau, a woman who had spoken out against sexism in her the engineering program was performing onstage at the engineering “skit night,” when the audience began to chant “shoot the bitch!”
Because of feminist protests, the University administration was forced to reprimand participants in the event for their verbal harassment of Brosseau, as well as for the sexist and misogynous content of several of the skits performed.
[32]
Feminists also resisted the mainstream construction of the massacre in other ways, including calling for a public inquiry, as did the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, despite the insistence of police that the matter was too traumatic to examine.
[33] There were also several symposia held by feminist groups across the country, including the feminist research group of Laval University.
[34] These symposia created knowledge informed by feminist theory about the massacre’s significance, and about the nature and extent of violence against women.
Speaking at the MATCH conference in 1990, Charlotte Bunch describes violence against women as “the most pervasive abuse of human rights in the world today,” and continues, “If any other group in society were systematically battered and killed in order to be controlled, we would understand that this is a civil emergency.
The war on women is a civil emergency.”
[35]
The third stream of feminist response to the December 6 massacre of women is to organise for change: For instance, despite its flaws, in marking December 6 as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, the government of Canada does acknowledge and highlight violence against women as a serious problem.
There has been much feminist organising around this date, including vigils, protests, and teaching.
Specific organisations which arose in response to the massacre include The December 6 Fund of Toronto, which keeps a yearly count of deaths resulting from violence against women in the Greater Toronto Area, and helps individual women to flee violence through providing interest-free loans.
[36]
The Coalition for Gun Control/pour le contrôle des armes was established in response to
feminist concerns about the ease with which Lépine acquired his murder weapon, a semi-automatic assault rifle.
[37] In response to lobbying done by this group, the federal government established a compulsory national gun registry, and made it more difficult to purchase guns.
[38] Anti-sexist men’s groups have taken up the cause of fighting misogynous violence, identifying it as a problem of masculinity.
The White Ribbon Campaign;[39] and Men For Change, through their Purple Ribbon Campaign[40] work to educate men about their responsibility to reject misogyny and violence.
Such organisations constitute only a small part of the wider campaign against misogynous violence and toward social justice.
Another organisation which addresses the problem of violence is NWAC’s “Sisters In Spirit” campaign,[41] which seeks justice for First Nations women who have been victims of individual male, and patriarchal structural violence.
DAWN, the DisAbled Women’s Network, works to increase awareness of the violence which women with disabilities are subjected to (“40 percent of women with disabilities have been raped, abused, or assaulted”[42]), and to change the structures that enable its continuation.
Feminist analyses of the December 6 massacre of women at the École Polytechnique demonstrate that it must be understood as an instance of misogynous violence, part of the broader problem of male violence against women.
Remembrance of the event must not be viewed as an end unto itself: We have remembered the 14 women killed by one man on that day in 1989, but we have not memorialised Alberta Williams,  Sherry Irving, Sarah Jean Devries,
Lisa Marie Young, Michelle Gurney, Janet Henry, Stephanie Lane, Elsie Sebastien, Jacqueline Marie Murdock, Tanya Marlo Holyk, Heather Chinnock, Olivia Gayle Williams – some of the missing First Nations victims of violence.
[43] We have a collective responsibility to recognise that violence against women is a pervasive function of patriarchal oppression which also intersects with other axes of oppression.
Remembrance must give way to action aimed a bringing about radical social change, ending individual acts of violence against women and changing violent social and economic structures.

[27]Enabling women’s flight from the violence of patriarchal families does work to diminish patriarchal power – the home is no longer viewed as a site where men are in complete control and are outside of public scrutiny.
However, from the beginning of the shelter movement, women’s shelters have been full.
The rate of their use has not declined.
This indicates that although their existence is profoundly important, women’s shelters cannot eliminate violence against women, or unequal power relations between men and women (which, of course, intersect with variables including race, economic status, ability, and so forth), because they do not effect structural change.

						<p align="justify"><b><span class="mw-headline">Childhood and upbringing</span></b></p>
						<p align="justify">Lépine was born <b>Gamil Rodrigue Gharbi</b>, the son 
						of
						Algerian immigrant Rachid Liass Gharbi and
						Canadian Monique Lépine, in
						Montreal and was baptized a
						Catholic as an infant.</p>
						<p align="justify">He spent much of his early childhood in
						Costa Rica and
						Puerto Rico, where his father was working as a 
						successful mutual fund salesman. The family moved back 
						to Montreal permanently in 1968, shortly before a stock 
						market crash led to the loss of much of the family's 
						assets.</p>
						<p align="justify">Gamil's father had contempt for women and believed 
						that they were only intended to serve men. He was 
						verbally and physically abusive to his wife and 
						children, once beating his son so hard on the face that 
						the marks were visible a week later. He discouraged 
						tenderness between mother and child, as he considered it 
						spoiling.</font></p>

						<p align="justify">

          <font face="verdana" style="font-size: 8pt">
							 
                        When Gamil was seven, his parents separated and were 
						subsequently divorced in 1976. He lived with his mother 
						and younger sister Nadia, seeing little of their father, 
						of whom they were afraid. Rachid Gharbi subsequently 
						ceased contact with his children and moved abroad.</p>

                        <style="font-size: 8pt" face="verdana"> 

						<p align="justify">In 1973, Monique Lépine returned to work as a nurse, 
						and began further courses to advance her career. During 
						this time the children lived with family and friends, 
						seeing their mother on weekends. The family spent a year 
						in family psychotherapy in 1975 because of difficulties 
						expressing and receiving love and affection.</p>
						<p align="justify"><b><span class="mw-headline">Adolescence</span></b></p>
						<p align="justify">In 1976, Monique Lépine became director of nursing at 
						a Montreal hospital, and the family bought and moved to 
						a house in the middle-class Montreal suburb of
						Pierrefonds. Gamil attended junior high and high 
						school where he was described as a quiet student who 
						obtained middle to above average marks. He developed a 
						close friendship with another boy, but did not mix much 
						with other students.</p>
						<p align="justify">Gamil spent some summers as a youth learning to hunt 
						with his uncles, and also enjoyed designing and building 
						electronic gadgets. He took considerable responsibility 
						at home, including doing cleaning and repairs while his 
						mother worked. During this time he began to insist on 
						being called Marc Lépine, giving his hatred of his 
						father as the reason for wishing to take his mother's 
						name.</p>
						<p align="justify">He applied to join the
						Canadian Forces in 1981 at the age of 17, but was 
						rejected during the interview process. He reported in 
						his suicide letter that it was because he was &quot;anti-social&quot;. 
						An official statement from the military after the 
						massacre stated that he had been &quot;interviewed, assessed 
						and determined to be unsuitable&quot;.</p>

						<p align="justify">After a year he switched from the university-destined

						his classes, particularly those related to 
						electrotechnology. However, in February 1986, during the 
						last term of the program, he suddenly and without 
						explanation stopped attending his classes, as a result 
						failing to complete his
						CEGEP diploma.</p>
						<p align="justify">Lépine took a job in the kitchens at the hospital 
						where his mother was director of nursing. He was seen as

						and in the fall of 1986, he applied to study engineering 
						at the École Polytechnique at the Université de Montréal. 
						He was admitted on the condition that he complete two 
						compulsory courses, including one in solution chemistry.</p>
						<p align="justify">In the fall of 1987 he left his job at the hospital 
						and took three courses at CEGEP obtaining good marks in 
						all his courses. 
						In March 1988 he began a course in computer programming 
						at a private college in downtown Montreal, funding his

						Two months later he moved downtown to an apartment near

						semi-automatic rifle at a local sporting goods

						December 6,
						1989, Lépine walked into the École Polytechnique de

        roughly 60 engineering students gathered in Room 303 on the second floor
        of the yellow-brick building sprawled across the north slope of the
        mountain in the heart of the city. He entered the classroom slowly a few
        minutes past 5 on a bitterly cold afternoon. There was a shy smile on
        his face as he interrupted a dissertation on the mechanics of heat
        transfer. In clear, unaccented French, he asked the women to move to one
        side of the room and ordered the men to leave. The request was greeted
        with titters of laughter. &quot;Nobody moved,&quot; recalled Prof. Yvan
        Bouchard. &quot;We thought it was a joke.&quot; An instant later,
        Bouchard and his students discovered that what they were confronting was
        no joke.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><style="font-size: 8pt">Shots</font></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The young man, who would later be identified as a
        25-year old semirecluse named Marc Lepine, lifted a light, semiautomatic
        rifle and fired two quick shots into the ceiling. &quot;You're all a
        bunch of feminists, and I hate feminists,&quot; Lepine shouted at the
        suddenly terrified occupants of Room 303. He told the men to leave-they
        did so without protest-and, as one of the young women attempted to
        reason with him, the gun-toting man opened fire in earnest. Six of the
        women were shot dead. Over the course of the next 20 minutes, the young
        man methodically stalked the cafeteria, the classrooms and the corridors
        of the school, leaving a trail of death and injury in his wake.  </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In four
        separate locations scattered around three floors of the six-storey
        structure, be gunned down a total of 27 people, leaving 14 of them dead.
        Finally, he turned his weapon against himself, blowing off the top of
        his skull. Most of the injured and all of the dead-except for the gunman
        himself-were women. This week, the city and the nation will mourn again
        for the victims as a funeral service is held for 11 of the victims at
        Montreal's Notre Dame Roman Catholic church. It was the worst single-day
        massacre in Canadian history. And the very senselessness of the act
        prompted an outpouring of grief, indignation and outright rage.  </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The City
        of Montreal and the Province of Quebec declared three days of mourning.
        Vigils were mounted in cities and towns from coast to coast. Churches
        held memorial services. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his wife,
        Mila, travelled to the school to offer their condolences on behalf of
        the rest of Canada. &quot;It is indeed a national tragedy &quot;he said.
        Earlier, with the flag atop Parliament fluttering at half-staff, the
        Prime Minister had asked a hushed House of Commons: &quot;Why such
        violence in a society that considers itself civilised and
        compassionate?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><style="font-size: 8pt">Rampage</font></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The question was not the only one that Marc Lepine's
        rampage raised. His actions and a three-page suicide note in which,
        police said, he blamed feminists for spoiling his life, threw into sharp
        relief a number of equally unsettling issues. They included: the extent
        to which the act reflected a society in which many women suffer violence
        at the hands of men; how he had reached the conclusion that simply to be
        female was sufficient cause to justify his victims' deaths; how a
        clearly disturbed man was able to obtain a lethal weapon with apparent
        ease; and how it was possible for a man with a gun to terrorize
        single-handedly so many people for so long without anyone lifting a hand
        to stop him. The tragedy also brought to light details of the killer's
        own troubled childhood, during which his violent father beat him, his
        mother and his younger sister, according to testimony in a divorce
        hearing.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">But no matter how pressing the unanswered questions
        were, it was simply a time for mourning last week for those close to the
        14 women whose lives were snuffed out on the brink of what, for most,
        had promised to be a bright future. They were intelligent, talented,
        skilled young people. By definition, they were out of the ordinary. They
        were women training to be engineers, a profession that is dominated by
        men. And they were enrolled in a school that is ranked as among the best
        in Quebec.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><style="font-size: 8pt">Interview</font></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">One of them, Anne-Marie Edward, was 21 years old,
        studying to become a chemical engineer. &quot;She was the kind of kid
        that a father never doubted would do well,&quot; her father, James
        Edward, told Maclean's last week during an interview in the family's
        comfortable home in suburban Pierrefonds. &quot;She was proudest of the
        fact that she had just been named to the university's alpine ski team.
        She did everything and still found time for her studies.&quot; Edward
        was wracked with anxiety when, driving home from work last Wednesday,
        his wife called him on his car phone to tell him that a gunman had gone
        berserk at the engineering school. When he eventually learned that his
        daughter had been found dead, slumped in a chair in the school's
        cafeteria, he was devastated. Struggling to control his emotions, he
        said, &quot;Ann~Marie was a super kid.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><style="font-size: 8pt">Rifle</font></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">It was around 5:10p.m. on Wednesday when Marc Lepine
        walked through one of the seven lightly controlled entrances into the
        engineering school. He was dressed in blue jeans, work boots, a dark
        jacket and peaked cap. He carried a green, polyethylene garbage bag
        holding two 30-clip magazines and a rifle. It was a .223 calibre Sturm,
        Ruger semiautomatic. He headed directiy for the second floor, where he
        encountered his first victim in the corridor 15 m from the office of the
        school's finance director. Lepine shot and killed Maryse Laganiere, 25,
        a recenfly married finance department employee. From that point, L6pine
        made his way along the second floor to Room 303, where he sent the male
        students out and opened fire, killing six of the 10 women who remained.
        
        </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Then, Lepine went down to the first floor. Firing at diving, ducking
        students as he went, he entered the cafeteria, where he killed Edward
        and two of her classmates. Still on the hunt, Lepine climbed back up to
        the third floor, where he strode into Room 311. Students, unaware of the
        unfolding tragedy, were delivering end-of-semester oral presentations.
        &quot;At first, nobody did anything,&quot; recalled Eric Forget, 21.
        Then, the gunman opened fire, sending two professors and 26 students
        scrambling for cover beneath their desks. &quot;We were trapped like
        rats,&quot; said Forget. &quot;He was shooting all over the place.&quot;
        Other eyewitnesses said that Lepine leaped onto several desks and shot
        at women cowering beneath them. Four more women were killed. Then,
        roughly 20 minutes after embarking on his rampage, Lepine took his own
        life.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><style="font-size: 8pt">Spree</font></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The toll of Lepine's rampage placed last week's
        tragedy near the top of the list of the worst such mass murders. The
        most lethal killing spree on recent record in North America occurred
        when Vietnam veteran James Huberty killed 21 people, including several
        children, at a McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro, Calif., in July,
        1984. Sniper Charles Whitman, who opened fire from the top of a tower at
        the University of Texas in Austin in August, 1966, and Ronald Gene
        Simmons-a retired air force sergeant who went on a December hilling
        spree in Arkansas in 1987-each took 16 lives. The worst mass killing in
        Canada before last week was in January, 1975, when 13 people died after
        being herded into a storage room in Montreal's Garganttia nightclub-one
        from gunshot wounds, the others from asphyxiation when the building was
        set on fire-in what was believed to be an underworld contract murder.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The number of Montrealers touched directly by the
        massacre swiftly amplified the sadness of the latest tragedy. Minutes
        after Lepine fired the final bullet, police officer Pierre Leclair, who
        had been briefing reporters outside the building, wandered in and found
        the body of his 23-year~old daughter, Maryse, a top student. Montreal
        city councillor Therese Daviau rushed home when she received reports of
        the shooting during a council meeting. But she had to wait until
        midnight to learn that her daughter, Genevieve Bergeron, had died. The
        following day, Mayor Jean Dore wiped tears from his eyes as he told
        reporters that Bergeron often babysat his three-year-old daughter. Said
        Dore of the massacre: &quot;You raise a kid and do everything to make
        the kid a responsible adult. Then, through a sheer act of madness, all
        this disappears.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><style="font-size: 8pt">Losses</font></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">As the victims' families took stock of their losses,
        the full brunt of the slaughter began to hit home. Schoolteacher Noella
        Fecteau told Maclean's that her niece Helene Colgan, a 23-year-old
        mechanical engineering student, was &quot;the pride of our entire
        family.&quot; Colgan was only one semester away from graduation. Said a
        tearful Fecteau, who travelled from Quebec City to console Colgan's
        parents at their home in Laval: &quot;Helene brought a lot of joy to the
        family. There are no words to describe the grief.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Fernand Croteau beat his fists against the wall of his
        home in suburban Brossard when he learned that one of his two
        daughters-23-year-old Nathalie-was a victim. She and her 20-year-old
        sister, a biochemistry student, were her father's greatest source of
        pride. Said Croteau, who works as a laboratory technician: &quot;I had
        two wonderful daughters. Now I only have one. The whole thing is
        incomprehensible. I am devastated.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><style="font-size: 8pt">Family</font></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">At the engineering school, the student body itself
        seemed to be a tightly knit family. Croteau and Colgan were among a
        group of classmates who had booked a New Year's holiday to Cancun,
        Mexico. But Lepine's brief reign of terror clearly reduced students to
        near helplessness. The four dozen men in Room 303 all left quickly,
        despite the clear threat to the women. And although there were more than
        2,500 students and adininistrators in the building, no one made any
        attempt to stop Lepine.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Andre Biron, the school's associate director of
        advanced studies and research, told Maclean's that he and several other
        administrators locked the door of a second-floor office when told that a
        gunman was loose. They remained there until police arrived. Added Biron:
        &quot;No one felt like a Rambo. It did not occur to me to
        intervene.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">A central figure in another shooting drama in Quebec
        more than five years ago concluded that someone should have intervened.
        Lepine's suicide note, which police described but did not release,
        referred to the assault on Quebec's national assembly by Canadian Armed
        Forces Cpl. Denis Lortie in 1984. Lortie, who burst into the provincial
        legislature dressed in army fatigues, killed three people before war
        veteran Rene Jalbert-then employed as the assembly's
        sergeant-at-arms-approached him unarmed and talked him into
        surrendering. From his home in Quebec City last week, Jalbert told
        Maclean's that it might also have been possible to cut short Le pine's
        mindless rampage. Declared Jalbert, who has received training in dealing
        with terrorists: &quot;I would have tried to do something. Somebody
        should have distracted the little bastard.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">At the same time, Jalbert said ordinary citizens
        cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror.
        &quot;When something like that happens, it is like a bomb going
        off,&quot; he added. &quot;People in those situations panic; they either
        freeze or go wild.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><style="font-size: 8pt">Guards</font></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">For his part, the University of Montreal's chief of
        security guards, Laurent Lemaire, told Maclean's that Lepine's massacre
        was unstoppable. Added Lemaire: &quot;if you can get away from a man who
        is killing people with a gun, that is what you do. The people around you
        no longer matter.&quot; Lemaire added that the university's expansive
        campus is difficult to secure. Said Lemaire: &quot;You cannot screen the
        45,000 people who come and go here every day. It is a city in
        itself.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><style="font-size: 8pt">Weapons</font></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Restricting the availability of weapons like the gun
        that Marc Lepine utilized to such lethal effect is another matter,
        however. The federal government is currently reviewing existing
        gun-control legislation, passed in 1978, and is expected to present new
        legislation soon. Justice Minister Douglas Lewis promised in the House
        of Commons last week that tougher laws were in the making. He said the
        main change will seek to thwart the import of semiautomatic weapons that
        can readily be converted to full, automatic firing. At the same time,
        while lamenting the massacre at the University of Montreal, he added ,
        We can't legislate against insanity.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Coping with the results of the particular form of
        insanity that occurred in Montreal last week is no less difficult. In
        the aftermath of the massacre, those most closely affected struggled to
        come to grips with what happened. Psychological counselling programs
        have been established for the victims' families, for the surviving
        students and even for the police officers who witnessed the carnage. For
        the rest, there was little to do but mourn. The closed coffins of nine
        of the 14 dead women were arranged late last week in the chapel beneath
        the University of Montreal's main tower. On Saturday, private viewings
        were held for immediate family. On Sunday, the general public was
        admitted. On Monday, the city's Paul Cardinal Gregoire will celebrate
        mass at Notre Dame before a congregation that was expected to include
        Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa and Prime Minister Muironey. The funeral
        service will bring an end to the official period of mourning. It will
        not erase the memory of the horror that fell upon the University of
        Montreal's engineering school.</font></p>
        &nbsp;<hr>&nbsp;
        <p align="justify"><b><style="font-size: 8pt">Lepine's suicide note:</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;Forgive the mistakes, I had 15 minutes to write
        this. Would you note that if I commit suicide today 89-12-06 it is not
        for economic reasons (for I have waited until I exhausted all my
        financial means, even refusing jobs) but for political reasons. Because
        I have decided to send the feminists, who have always ruined my life, to
        their Maker. For seven years life has brought me no joy and being
        totally blase, I have decided to put an end to those viragos. I tried in
        my youth to enter the Forces as a student-officer, which would have
        allowed me possibly to get into the arsenal and precede Lortie in a
        raid. They refused me because antisocial [sic]. I therefore had to wait
        until this day to execute my plans. In between, I continued my studies
        in a haphazard way for they never really interested me, knowing in
        advance my fate. Which did not prevent me from obtaining very good marks
        despite my theory of not handing in work and the lack of studying before
        exams. Even if the Mad Killer epithet will be attributed to me by the
        media, I consider myself a rational erudite that only the arrival of the
        Grim Reaper has forced to take extreme acts. For why persevere to exist
        if it is only to please the government. Being rather backward-looking by
        nature (except for science), the feminists have always enraged me. They
        want to keep the advantages of women (e.g. cheaper insurance, extended
        maternity leave preceded by a preventative leave, etc.) while seizing
        for themselves those of men. Thus it is an obvious truth that if the
        Olympic Games removed the Men-Women distinction, there would be Women
        only in the graceful events. So the feminists are not fighting to remove
        that barrier. They are so opportunistic they neglect to profit from the
        knowledge accumulated by men through the ages. They always try to
        misrepresent them every time they can. Thus, the other day, I heard they
        were honoring the Canadian men and women who fought at the frontline
        during the world wars. How can you explain then that women were not
        authorized to go to the frontline??? Will we hear of Caesar's female
        legions and female galley slaves who of course took up 50 per cent of
        the ranks of history, though they never existed. A real Casus Belli.
        Sorry for this too brief letter. Marc Lepine</font></p>

		<p align="justify"><b><style="font-size: 8pt">One man's massacre</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Marc Lépine sat in his apartment at 2175 rue de
        Bordeaux, in east-central Montreal, on the afternoon of 6 December,
        checking over his Ruger Mini-14 Rifle, a semi-automatic chambered for
        .223 Remington cartridges and able to be field-stripped to its basic
        subassemblies in seconds – a deadly piece of precision engineering.
        </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">When he left his apartment, in the middle of the afternoon, he had the
        rifle concealed in a bin-liner, a hunting knife strapped to the belt of
        his jeans, an arsenal of five- and thirty-shot magazines in a carrier
        bag, and three boxes of .223 bullets stuffed in the pockets of his gray
        anorak. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The light was already fading from the winter sky and the
        temperature had started to plunge. Lépine climbed into his rented car
        and joined the slow-moving traffic in the freezing drizzle on the rue de
        Bordeaux. His destination was the École Polytechnique, the Université
        de Montréal’s engineering school, five kilometres west across the
        city, on the slopes of Mount-Royal.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">At the École Polytechnique, William Winegard, the
        federal Minister of State for Science and Technology, was in mid-visit,
        offering congratulations on the record 19 percent enrolment of women in
        the first-year engineering programme, and discussing a federal
        scholarship plan aimed at bringing more women into engineering and
        science. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In the ground floor cafeteria, bursting with &quot;Bonne Année&quot;
        decorations, streamers and balloons, there was a stronger than usual air
        on bonhomie. It was the last day of classes before the Christmas
        vacation. Barbara Klueznik, a first-year nursing student at the
        Université de Montréal, walked across the campus with her husband,
        Witold Widajewicz, a neourophysiologist. They had been high school
        sweethearts and had come to Canada from Poland in 1987. They headed for
        the École Polytechnique cafeteria.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Towards 5:10 P.M., in Room 230, on the second floor
        – a room facing east, towards the Hôpital Général de Montréal and
        the Cimetiére de Notre-Dame-des-Neiges – Luc Gauthier rose from his
        seat and quietly left the mechanical engineering class to pay a visit to
        the lavatory. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">As he headed off down the corridor, he passed a man who
        appeared to be in his early twenties, carrying a bin-liner and wearing a
        &quot;Montréal Tracteur&quot; baseball cap. In Room 230, Professeurs
        Yvon Bouchard and Adrian Cernea sat listening to an oral presentation by
        two of their students. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In the corridor, Lépine slid the Ruger out of
        the bin-liner. Prof. Bouchard failed to see anyone enter the room but
        became aware of the alien presence when Lépine demanded that
        &quot;everyone stop everything&quot; and angled to within two or three
        feet of the students giving the presentation. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">One of the pair, Eric
        Chavarie, observed that Lépine &quot;was smiling… He was very
        calm.&quot; Many of the sixty-strong class thought the gunman was an
        end-of-term prankster. &quot;It was our last hour of term,&quot; student
        Pierre Robert subsequently recalled. &quot;We practically laughed.&quot;
        Even Eric Chavarie, who could have considered himself to have been in
        the most immediate danger, &quot;thought it was a joke.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lépine, still smiling, fired a shot into the ceiling
        and address the class: &quot;Separate yourselves. Girls to the left and
        guys to the right.&quot; Nobody moved. Pierre Robert thought the shot
        was a blank. Lépine repeated the order, managing to inject sufficient
        authority into his voice for the class to start separating. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">One or two
        of the more nervous students now edged behind pillars and, in the
        confusion, males and females became mixed in the two groups. What, in
        dreams, Lépine had no doubt envisaged as a clockwork military
        operation, was turning into a farce. He reiterated his demand that the
        men assemble at the right-hand side of the room and that the girls
        gather at the left. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Eventually, the students were divided as he wanted
        them. &quot;OK,&quot; he said, &quot;guys leave, girls stay there.&quot;
        The males students, goaded by Lépine’s request to &quot;move your
        asses,&quot; and still unsure what was going on, began filing out into
        the corridor.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">When the last man had left the room, Lépine turned to
        the nine female engineering majors who remained. He was positioned
        between them and the door and he asked them if they knew why he had
        come.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;No,&quot; replied one student, Nathalie Provost.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;I’m here to fight against feminism,&quot; said
        Lépine.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;Look, we are just women studying
        engineering,&quot; Provost tried to reason with him &quot;…just
        students intent on leading a normal life.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;You’re all a bunch of feminists!&quot; Lépine
        yelled – and opened fire.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">He sprayed the group of nine girls from left to right,
        emptying most, if not all, of the bullets of the thirty-shot magazine
        into their bodies. Nathalie Provost collapsed with wounds to her lower
        leg and a bullet graze above her left eye; she was one of the luckier
        ones. Six of her classmates fell dead. Their average age was 21 and the
        causes of death ranged from a single head wound, to massive
        haemorrhaging from nine bullets and four ricochets. Outside the room,
        the male students, hearing the shots, hightailed it to safety.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lépine began stalking the second-floor corridors. He
        turned a corner and was faced, 30 metres away, with a group of people
        milling round a block of photocopiers. He raised the rifle and fired.
        Three people fell to the floor wounded. Eric Chavarie, who had lingered
        down at the far end of the corridor, now fled for the stairs. Other
        students in the vicinity did likewise. Lépine advanced past the
        photocopiers in classic military mode, back to the wall, wheeling and
        firing.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;There is a hostage-taking, there is gunfire and
        there are lots of people wounded.&quot; The first 911 call from the École
        Polytechnique was logged at 5:12 P.M. Within minutes, the Montreal
        emergency communications system would be inundated with calls. Yet, for
        all its fibre optic cables, digital substations, computer-aided human
        operatives and VHF radio channels, its ability to get law enforcement
        officers on the scene was light years behind Lépine’s ability to
        inflict death – armed as he was with a 1,000-metres-per-second muzzle
        velocity weapon. With impunity, he continued to roam the second-floor
        foyer, terrace café and corridors.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In the finance department, Maryse Laganiére hurried
        to lock the office door. Lépine, stalking up the corridor turned and
        came trotting down, arriving in time to take aim through the window,
        which, unfortunately, squarely framed Laganiére as she turned away into
        the interior of the office. He fired twice, one of the shots shattering
        her skull. Lépine returned to the now deserted second-floor foyer and
        stepped onto an escalator; heading down.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In the ground-floor cafeteria, Witold Widajewicz was
        trying to decide what he wanted to eat. His wife, Barbara Klueznik, had
        already filled her tray and paid the cashier. Suddenly, people came
        running, pushing Widajewicz into the cafeteria kitchen and slamming the
        door shut. He lay on the floor with the others and tried to work out
        what was happening. The chef was standing by the door with a knife.
        </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Meanwhile, a .223-calibre bullet entered Barbara Klueznik’s lower
        back, lacerated her left kidney, pancreas, spleen, diaphragm, liver,
        heart and left lung, fractured her sixth and seventh ribs and exited
        from her left breast, the force of the shot skewing her so that a second
        bullet entered at the left breast, made an equally devastating reverse
        journey through her body, before exiting from her back – all prior to
        the brain of neurophysiologist Widajewicz registering the sound of
        gunshots and concluding there was a holdup: &quot;I believed it was only
        the cashier that was endangered.&quot; Barbara Maria Klueznik, needless
        to say, was already dead.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lépine strolled the length of the cafeteria, firing
        off shots at will. Those who had not fled sought the desperately
        inadequate cover of moulded plastic chairs and laminated tables. By the
        time Lépine left the cafeteria by a door at the far end, two more young
        women lay dead and one other girl was wounded. He went in search of
        fresh prey on the third floor.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The first two police vehicles now arrived at the École
        Polytechnique, having, in the first instance, been directed to the Tour
        des Vierges (the student halls of residence). They were joined almost
        immediately by another from the same district. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In the absence of a
        senior police official, the officers of one vehicle took charge, and
        proceeded to cordon off the college, positioning police cars to the
        southwest and north-west of the building. The district commander, his
        lieutenant, a tactical intervention unit, a scenes of crimes team and
        ambulances had all yet to arrive.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Suddenly, Lépine appeared in the third-floor foyer,
        shooting and wounding three students. Down the corridor, an engineering
        materials class was in progress. At the front of the class, Eric Forget,
        Maryse Leclair and Roger Thiffault were giving an oral presentation.
        </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">They paused a moment, listening. To the ears of anyone unfamiliar with
        semi-automatic rifle fire, or conditioned only to its electronically
        enhanced representation on film soundtracks, the distant sound of
        gunshots could have been a dozen other things. &quot;We thought it was
        something falling on the ground,&quot; Eric Forget would subsequently
        recall. &quot;Everybody looked around, we wondered what it was, but we
        didn’t realize it was gunshots,&quot; and they continued with their
        presentation.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">A short while later, the door of the room burst open
        and Lépine entered, cradling the Ruger rifle. From Eric Forget’s
        position, the example of high-specification mechanical engineering in Lépine’s
        hands &quot;could have been a toy&quot; – an appraisal he would
        quickly revise as Lépine advanced, yelling &quot;Get out, get
        out,&quot; and shot and wounded Maryse Leclair. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Forget and Thiffault,
        along with the two professors, scrambled for cover. Lépine shifted his
        stance to shoot into the front rows of the class, and swiveled again to
        target Maud Haviernick and Michèle Richard as they looped away, trying
        to reach the door. The two young women had worked all term on the same
        metals project and were also paired together in death.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lépine began tracking up and down the aisle at the
        side of the room, firing between the rows of desks. Four students were
        hit. Roger Thiffault spotted a classmate, Annie Turcotte, between rows
        five and six, &quot;moaning, crying out for help and bleeding and
        bleeding.&quot; Turcotte had been shot twice in the upper body. The
        blood was maple-leafed across her white blouse and she twitched under
        the desks like a nightmare Canadian flag. She would not survive.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">There was a brief pause in the shooting, as Lépine
        came to the end of a magazine and swiftly reloaded. Two students took
        the opportunity to scurry to the door and escape to the safety of the
        corridor. Lépine stepped up on a chair, and began stomping across the
        desktops. Eric Forget kept his head down: &quot;He was shooting all over
        the place. If you put your head out, he could take it off.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Maryse Leclair lay bleeding on the rostrum, a position
        she had been in ever since Lépine had entered the room and hit her with
        his initial shot. The bullet had shattered six of her ribs and bone
        splinters had lacerated her left lung. She gulped air as she moaned for
        help. Lépine leapt up on the rostrum next to her and drew his knife,
        the blade exposed with surgical candour in the flat, fluorescent light.
        The heaviest of three knife-blows found Maryse Leclair’s heart and she
        moaned no more. She was the fourteenth fatality.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lépine drew a deep breath and calmly put the knife
        down on the professor’s desk, together with two boxes of cartridges
        and his baseball cap. He sat down and took off his anorak, revealing a
        &quot;Skate Rags&quot; sweater with a death’s head motif. He wrapped
        the anorak around the gun’s barrel. Those who were listening heard him
        mutter, &quot;Oh, shit&quot; – those who were watching saw him squeeze
        the trigger, blowing the top off his own head. It was not yet 5:30 P.M.
        The rampage had lasted less than twenty minutes.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Outside in the freezing drizzle, the police cordon
        around the college had grown to seventeen vehicles and twenty-eight
        officers. At 5:35 P.M., just as news was coming through that the gunman
        had killed himself, the district commander arrived to take charge of the
        operation. One minute later, the first police officers entered the
        building.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Witold Widajewicz left the cafeteria kitchen by the
        fire escape, still under the impression that there had been a holdup. In
        his laboratory, in the main building of the Université de Montréal, he
        heard the first radio reports of the massacre. He rushed back to the École
        Polytechnique. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">It was the middle of the night when police finally
        allowed him to re-enter the building: &quot;I found Barbara in the
        cafeteria. She was still a little bit warm… I opened the zipper and
        found a hole in the left breast, the breast I had kissed that day –
        one hole that finished everything, the American Dream in this country…
        We believed that Canada was the safest place in the world. We could have
        gone to West Germany, or Switzerland.&quot;</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><b><style="font-size: 8pt">Marc Lepine</font></b></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Monique Lépine, a Montreal nurse, was 26 years old
        when she met Algerian-born businessman Liesse Gharbi in 1962. Monique
        was from a middle-class, French-Canadian family - the daughter of a bank
        manager - and her professional devotion to the sick had superseded an
        earlier belief that she had a vocation in the Catholic Church. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Liesse
        was 30 years old, a big, confident man - self-made and proud of it, like
        Charles Whitman's father - in the wheeler-dealer world of investment
        finance. &quot;A very bright guy,&quot; according to his lawyer, Stanley
        Selinger. &quot;He spoke a number of languages and was a fantastic
        salesman. A slick dresser. He could sell the Brooklyn Bridge to
        anyone.&quot; Monique fell for him and they married the following year,
        1963, in New York State, USA.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The early years were a golden time for the Gharbis.
        Their first child, a son, was born on 26 October 1964, and christened
        Gamil Rodrigue; a daughter, Nadia, was born two years later. Liesse
        raked in the money through the booming mid-sixties and the family
        enjoyed smart homes, big cars and big parties. But the Gharbis' marriage
        soon began to sour. Monique found herself increasingly embarrassed and
        humiliated by her husband's incessant womanizing. There were rumours he
        had mistresses in Brossard and Longueuil. Closer to home, a neighbour,
        Francine Charron, said she was subjected to his attentions and his
        &quot;fairly vulgar approach.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The glitzy social life of parties and dinners became
        an ordeal for Monique: &quot;I feared those outings because ... of the
        advances he made to women and his habit of rubbing himself against the
        women he danced with.&quot; She claimed he even indulged in frictional
        behaviour with total strangers on public transport. It was clear to many
        in the Gharbis' social circle, including Stanley Selinger, that &quot;he
        never really respected women ... His wife was not his equal, more like
        chattel.&quot; It was a philosophy that, as time went by, Liesse
        increasingly impressed upon his spouse with physical violence.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In 1972, Monique was granted custody of the two
        children and possession of the family apartment, on rue Prieur, in an
        affluent north-end neighbourhood. The separation from Liesse followed
        two particularly torrid years of marriage during which, she told a
        divorce hearing, she had been beaten by her husband in front of family
        and friends (slammed repeatedly into the stone wall of a cottage on one
        occasion), had liquor thrown in her face for returning home late from a
        social outing, cowered in a cellar for hours in fear of another beating,
        and witnessed the frequent thrashing of her children if they sang too
        loudly or failed to say good morning to their father.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Liesse was a violent man. Although he denied that he
        had ever physically abused his family to the extent Monique claimed -
        &quot;It is certain that occasionally in life someone can receive a
        slap, but to hit someone and hurt them, no&quot; - there was much
        corroborative testimony for his wife's allegations, and Quebec Superior
        Court Justice Jeanne Warren, particularly disturbed to learn of his
        refusals to. allow Monique to console the children after he had beaten
        them, restricted his visits with Gamil and Nadia to once a month, and
        only under strict supervision. Liesse, however, took little subsequent
        interest in his offspring.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">After the breakdown of the marriage, Monique returned
        to her nursing career. She worked long hours, studied hard and had
        little time to spare for the children. For a few years, until they were
        old enough to be left on their own, Gamil and Nadia were shuffled
        between the willing hands of relatives and friends. Gamil appears to
        have had a lot of affection for one uncle in particular, reportedly a
        former US Special Forces-trained paratrooper who taught him how to use a
        gun. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">During this period, Monique became so concerned by her and the
        children's &quot;difficulties expressing our need to love and be
        loved&quot; that she enrolled the family in psychotherapy. In the summer
        of 1976, with a year of psychotherapy behind them, she and the children
        also said goodbye to the bad memories of rue Prieur, and moved into a
        small house, on rue Perron, in Pierrefonds. There were woods and a river
        nearby and it seemed like a good place for wounds to heal.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">When Gamil Gharbi started Grade 7 at École Secondaire
        St. Thomas, in Pointe Claire, he was a quiet, withdrawn young boy who
        habitually hid himself and his shock of black, curly hair under one of
        his many, baseball caps. Jean Bélanger, also from the rue Perron
        neighbourhood, first came across him on the school bus: &quot;So, here
        was this new guy on the bus and I'm the talkative type and he obviously
        wasn't. So I sat next to him.&quot; Gamil had found himself a friend.
        The two boys lived practically next door to each other, went to school
        together, spent the evenings and weekends together, and became great
        friends.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In Bélanger's opinion, &quot;the guy was not
        nutso,&quot; although he clearly had some problems. When he first
        started visiting the Bélanger house, &quot;he would get inside the
        front door, take off his boots, tug his hat down, and all but run past
        my parents ... It was kind of as though he was afraid of
        something.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">However, it was never very easy for Jean to find out
        what was going on inside Gamil's head - &quot;If he would have a
        problem, he would never ask for help. If something hurt him inside, he
        would keep it to himself&quot; - and only once, after persistent
        probing, did Gamil refer to his violent father: &quot;He told me they
        would be sitting at the dinner table and if his mother served Marc and
        Nadia before the father, the father would go nuts and start beating
        everybody.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">At school, Gamil's academic record was good. Socially,
        he was a lot less competent. With the exception of Jean Bélanger, he
        avoided contact with other students as much as possible. He sat at the
        back of classes if he could manage it, and gave a wide berth to team
        sports, school clubs, even the cafeteria at lunchtimes. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">It was during a
        lunch hour, one day in Grade 8, sitting at a quiet spot in woods near
        the school, that Gamil told Jean he was going to take his mother's name:
        &quot;He said he wanted my name, Jean, too. Jean Lépine. I said that
        would be too confusing - Jean and Jean-because we were together all the
        time. So he thought for a moment and said: 'OK, how about Marc? Marc Lépine?'
        &quot; Thereafter, he went around calling himself Marc Lépine and
        signed his school work the same way.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lépine's major interest was electronics and he wanted
        to be an electronics engineer or computer engineer. He spent much of his
        time with Jean in the basement of the Bélanger house, designing and
        assembling light sequencers, sound effects systems, mini-computers -
        anything they could construct from salvaged electronic junk. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The boys
        were also interested in guns and warfare. They visited an army surplus
        store from time to time, but Bélanger observed no developing
        psychopathy in his friend's purchases: a gas mask here, a helmet there.
        It was the same when it came to shooting pigeons with their air guns:
        &quot;He wasn't like, 'Yeah, I want to kill.' It was just fun. We were
        kids.&quot; Bélanger's recollection of their pigeon-shooting days is,
        nevertheless, somewhat chilling in the light of subsequent events:
        &quot;We each had a pellet gun and when the pigeons would fly up from
        their perch, pow. He was better than me. He could shoot one while it was
        flying. He didn't miss a lot.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">According to Bélanger, Lépine found little sister
        Nadia hard work: &quot;She was the total opposite to Marc. He was the
        quiet intellectual. She used to taunt him all the time. She used to call
        him Gamil, Gamil, Gamil ... if you wanted to really bug him, just call
        him Gamil.&quot; With Monique working and studying, Marc was given the
        task of looking after Nadia. He didn't get a summer job but he was paid
        by his mother to stay at home and do the chores.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In 1978, Monique enlisted the help of the Big Brothers
        Association to provide a surrogate father. The Big Brother was an
        easy-going man in his mid-forties, and Marc got along well with him;
        Jean too. He introduced them to photography and motorbikes, took them to
        the cinema, even bought them electronic equipment. The following year,
        1979, the boys graduated from St. Thomas Junior High to Polyvalente des
        Sources, in Dollard des Ormeaux. Lépine maintained his reputation as a
        sound, if nondescript student. Robert Oullette taught him maths:
        &quot;He was very usual, average, plain and typical.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lépine appears to have remained fairly happy through
        this period. The Big Brother was a lot of fun and although Jean Bélanger
        was now dating a girl, Gina Cousineau, Lépine had few fears of losing
        his buddy to Cupid. He was very shy around Gina at first but after
        getting to know her &quot;he was fine. He said I was not just a typical
        girl ... I was more like one of the guys ... We were always together,
        the three of us ... We became like the Three Musketeers.&quot; Bélanger
        encouraged Lépine to try dating for himself but &quot;he had a lot of
        problems with that. It's not that he wasn't interested. Maybe the way
        that he approached women wasn't exactly the way women like.&quot; The
        Three Musketeers never got to be four.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In 1981, the Big Brother suddenly disappeared. Lépine
        told contradictory stories about what had happened. First he said that
        the man had simply taken off to Europe, then that he was gay, had
        assaulted a young boy, and been jailed. Bélanger was never sure which,
        if any, of the explanations was true. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In the winter of 1981-2, in the
        wake of the Big Brother's disappearance, Lépine walked into the army
        recruiting office in downtown Montreal and filled out an application.
        The military rejected him - &quot;interviewed, assessed and determined
        [him] to be unsuitable,&quot; according to the official statement. He
        was 17 years old.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Soon after the army rejection, Monique sold the house
        in Pierrefonds and moved the family into an apartment in Marlborough
        Court, on the western perimeter of the Aéroport de Cartierville, in St.
        Laurent. It was nearer to St. Jude de Laval Hospital, a long-term care
        facility, where she worked as a director of nursing. Of more relevance
        to Lépine, it was far enough away from Pierrefonds for him gradually to
        lose touch with his only close friend, Jean Bélanger. Bélanger thought
        that &quot;Marc didn't seem very happy there. We had been together for
        so long, I guess maybe he was lonely.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In the autumn of 1982, Lépine enrolled at CEGEP St.
        Laurent (a community college), in a pure sciences course - a popular
        route to engineering school. At home, he was shutting himself away in
        his room with his books, piles of electronic components, and an old
        computer - the major input from the outside world being the sound of
        aircraft on the nearby flight path. On one of the last occasions Jean Bélanger
        saw him, Lépine gave the impression that these days his best friend was
        the computer.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">It was now that Lépine's plans for a career in
        engineering started to go awry. He failed two subjects in the first term
        of his course. His grades improved somewhat in term two but he decided,
        nevertheless, to make the first of what would develop into a bizarre
        geometry of career moves. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In the autumn of 1983, he switched from pure
        sciences to a narrower programme in electronics. Then, strangely, in
        January 1986, with just a few months to go to graduation, he suddenly
        aborted the course. &quot;He quit for reasons we don't know,&quot;
        Claude Boily, the director of CEGEP St. Laurent revealed. &quot;He did
        not notify the college of his decision. He just stopped going to his
        classes.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">According to Boily's records, Lépine enrolled in a total
        of fifty-seven course components, passed in forty-one of them, leaving
        sixteen that he either failed or dropped. &quot;[He] was never seen by
        any of our psychologists and there was not any report in his file noting
        that he had any behavioural problems.&quot; Boily's only clue to Lépine's
        motive for quitting came from a head of department who seemed to
        remember that he had talked about attending the École Polytechnique. Lépine's
        first verifiable visit to the engineering school was, in fact, on 11
        September 1985 - he made a purchase at the Students' Cooperative - and
        it was soon after this that his CEGEP tutor noticed an unexplained drop
        in his marks.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">If Lépine quit CEGEP St. Laurent in the belief that
        the course components he had already completed were sufficient
        qualification for gaining admission to the École Polytechnique, then he
        was wrong. When he filed his application to the engineering school in
        1986, he was deficient in two subjects. He was informed that his
        application could be reconsidered only after he had completed the two
        courses he was lacking. The rejection by the École Polytechnique
        appears to have outraged Lépine; certainly, it marked the end of his
        studies for a while. He got a job in the kitchens of St. Jude de Laval
        Hospital.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The work at St. Jude's failed to challenge his
        intellectual abilities, but the money he was earning did enable him to
        save for a new computer and to move out of his mother's house and rent a
        modem, one-bedroom apartment in Laval. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In the eyes of landlord Luc
        Riopel, Lépine was a model tenant. He paid his rent on time, kept the
        place clean and was no bother to his neighbours: &quot;He was a good
        guy. But he lived in isolation and did not appear very happy. He told me
        he didn't like working at the hospital. It was not what he wanted to do
        for a living. It was just a job for him. His real interest was in
        computers. And war books. He had a lot of war books.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">At St. Jude's, Lépine's poor social skills made
        things difficult for him. He worked at a hundred miles an hour and tried
        to take on the persona of a wisecracking extrovert. Things got broken
        and nobody found him funny. Most people kept their distance. Dominique
        Leclair, a student who worked at the hospital on her summer vacation,
        was an exception: &quot;I was kind to him because he was so hyperactive
        and nervous. Everyone else tried to avoid him because he was a bit
        strange because of his shyness.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lépine did a spell serving food
        out in the cafeteria but people complained about his acne. He was
        banished back to the kitchens and tried to grow a beard. When Dominique
        Leclair returned to college in the autumn, Lépine followed suit.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">He enrolled in a short course at CEGEP Montmorency,
        studying mass communication, algebra and politics. He worked hard and
        completed the course, gaining marks of 75 per cent or higher in all
        three components. His enthusiasm for study rekindled, he took an
        entrance exam, and passed, for a $9,000 computer course at the private
        Control Data Institute in downtown Montreal. He began the course in
        March 1988. The setup at Control Data had a major attraction for him:
        students worked alone - no group work for him to try to avoid, no
        classes for him to try to find a back seat in. The only interaction
        necessary was with a computer and, true to form, he was known as the
        quiet guy who liked to wear baseball caps.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">His studies, ostensibly, were leading him towards
        having another crack at getting a place at the École Polytechnique.
        Geographically, he was certainly gravitating towards the campus. He had
        started out in Pierrefonds, twenty kilometres from the Université de
        Montréal site; his final move, to 2175 rue de Bordeaux, took him to
        within five kilometres. He shared the second floor apartment there with
        an old high school acquaintance, Erik Cossette.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">It was from around the time of this last change of
        address that some of the private turmoil going on inside Lépine's head
        began to manifest itself publicly. He was giving many people the
        impression that his sights were still set on gaining admission to the École
        Polytechnique; yet, other people were being fed a quite different story.
        Luc Riopel, the Laval landlord, said that when Lépine moved out, he had
        said that he was going off to join the army. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lépine also got in touch
        with his old buddy, Jean Bélanger, their first contact in about five
        years, and told him he was thinking of joining the military. He had gone
        to a high school reunion in the hope of seeing Bélanger, but Bélanger,
        in hospital after an accident, was unable to attend. Lépine did,
        however, see Bélanger's former sweetheart, Gina Cousineau, at the
        reunion. She was there with her fiancé. They talked at some length.
        Gina asked him how he came to finish working at St. Jude's: &quot;He
        told me he had been fired by a woman and that another woman had taken
        his place.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lépine's hostility towards women and his sexist views
        were becoming increasingly overt. His flatmate, Erik Cossette, found his
        views offensive but not unusual. He tended to put the bitter remarks
        down to Lépine's inability to establish intimate relationships with
        women and he felt that Lépine just needed to socialize more. As it was,
        he spent most of his free time with his computer and books, or watching
        videos from his large collection of mostly pirated Pay-TV war movies,
        examining what Cossette called the &quot;strategic aspect&quot; of war.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">As well as the programme at Control Data, Lépine had
        also enrolled in an evening update course in chemistry at CEGEP Vieux
        Montréal, a prerequisite for getting accepted by the École
        Polytechnique. Here, in February 1989, he met a young woman called
        Sylvie Drouin. Sylvie thought him quite a good-looking guy and asked him
        to be her lab partner. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Their relationship got off to a poor start. Lépine
        called her &quot;Fräulein&quot; all the time and for the first few
        weeks &quot;he was very severe with me. I was never correct. He was
        being a fascist.&quot; Sylvie finally gave him an ultimatum: leave off
        or get himself another partner. Lépine began treating her with a bit
        more respect.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Sylvie was also taking a course in computers and asked
        Lépine if he could help her. She suggested maybe she could come over to
        his place. &quot;In the beginning, he was a lot of fun. I remember the
        first time I walked in and he told me to sit on the chair and he showed
        me all these things he could do with his computer - colours,
        three-dimensional stuff, that kind of thing.&quot; But Lépine was not a
        very good teacher and when it came to Sylvie's homework, he simply
        wanted to solve the problems himself and hand the finished result over
        to her. Sylvie, nevertheless, continued her visits. They spent about a
        dozen evenings together in the spring and early summer of 1989, but the
        relationship remained platonic and Lépine became increasingly
        uncommunicative and withdrawn.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Although the world inside Lépine's head spilled into
        the public domain less frequently now, on the occasions when it did, it
        showed itself to be a more sinister world than had previously been seen.
        One day he turned up at the chemistry class with a newspaper clipping
        about a policewoman, bitterly complaining that women should not be
        allowed on the police force. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In the ensuing discussion, the lab
        assistant, André Tremblay, submitted that the Montreal police had a
        large number of female officers, a suggestion with which Lépine took
        fierce issue: &quot;He said 'to date, I have only found the names of six
        of them in newspaper stories.' &quot; Erik Cossette also received
        lectures from Lépine on women in &quot;male&quot; occupations, as did
        the employees in a neighbourhood grocery store.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The one place where an altogether happier Lépine
        could be found, was Checkmate Sports, a gunshop, on rue St. Hubert. An
        assistant at Checkmate would later recall, &quot;He used to come in like
        many young punks, browsing around ... [He] didn't appear crazier than
        anybody else ... he seemed like a happy guy. I guess he felt good here
        ... It isn't a place where you see a lot of women. It is like a boys'
        club - toys for boys.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Sylvie Drouin saw Lépine one final time, about a week
        after the chemistry class finished in May 1989. She was still unaware
        that as long ago as March he had quit the Control Data computer course.
        &quot;The reason he gave,&quot; said Jean Cloutier, the director of
        Control Data, &quot;was that he was going to change his career. He did
        not say what his plans were.&quot; Sylvie told Lépine she had been
        accepted for an engineering programme at the Université du Québec a
        Trois Riviéres. He told her he would be going to the École
        Polytechnique in the autumn.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lépine, in fact, was going nowhere. All his ambitions
        had come to nothing. The weeks passed. Sylvie had said she might phone
        him through the summer, but never did. At the end of the summer, Erik
        Cossette deserted him to go back-packing in South America. On 5
        September, Lépine applied for, and subsequently received, a Firearms
        Acquisition Permit. On 21 November, he purchased the Ruger Mini-14 Rifle
        and a hundred rounds of ammunition from Checkmate Sports. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The next day,
        he was seen wandering the second floor of the École Polytechnique. He
        was seen again at the engineering school on 1 December (twice), 4
        December, and 5 December. On the afternoon of 5 December, he also rented
        a car. The following day, Wednesday 6 December, he drove the car through
        a freezing drizzle to the École Polytechnique. It was the last day of
        classes before the Christmas vacation; and it was the last hour of life
        for Marc Lépine. He parked the car in a tow-away area.</font></p>
        &nbsp;<hr>&nbsp;
        <p align="justify"><b><style="font-size: 8pt">Misogynist gunman's bullets are still felt</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">MONTREAL&nbsp; -- Sylvain Brouillette had been a
        street cop for four years and was working undercover fighting gangs on
        Dec. 6, 1989. But none of that prepared him for the carnage he saw at
        Ecole polytechnique that night.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;We were trained at police academy for
        everything,&quot; he recalled. &quot;But you're never trained to see 14
        nice ladies die that way.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Brouillette was one of the first police to arrive that
        bleak winter night at the scene of gunman Marc Lepine's rampage, the
        worst mass shooting in Canada's history.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;I've never been to Vietnam, but ..,&quot;
        Brouillette said as he recalled the scene after he responded to the
        police radio's crackling alert that shots were being fired at Ecole
        polytechnique.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;A few people had blood on their faces, I saw a
        student jump from a window. Everybody was crying and yelling.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Police trying to get a handle on the situation were
        told there was shooting in the first-floor cafeteria and on the third
        and fourth floors. Brouillette, who was 25 and close to the age of many
        of the school's students, thought it was a commando raid.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;I thought we'd have to fight with two, or three
        or four men with Uzis,&quot; a submachine-gun.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">But it was only one man -- Marc Lepine, who had
        entered the school about 15 minutes before, armed with an assault rifle,
        bandoliers of ammunition and a burning grudge against women.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Despite his hunting clothes, Lepine was barely noticed
        as he walked quietly through the bustling halls to a first-floor
        classroom where 60 students were getting a lecture on heat-transfer
        engineering. Then he strode to the front of the room and ordered the men
        to one side and the women to the other in a clear, firm voice.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Some students laughed, thinking he was joking. Then
        Lepine, whom a witness recalled as having &quot;cold eyes,&quot; tore
        the plastic wrapping from his rifle and blasted a bullet into the
        ceiling.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The men were told to get out. One woman who tried to
        follow was shot.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;You're women, you're going to be
        engineers,&quot; witnesses recalled Lepine ranting. &quot;You're all a
        bunch of feminists. I hate feminists.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Student Nathalie Provost tried to reason with Lepine,
        25, who had failed at several career attempts, including electrical
        engineering.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;I argued with him,&quot; Provost said later.
        &quot;I told him we weren't feminists or interested in fighting men. We
        just wanted to be professional engineers.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;He didn't answer me.&quot; He shot her three
        times.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">People scrambled under desks. Six women were killed
        and four others including Provost were wounded.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lepine bolted from the classroom, heading down the
        hall to where Maryse Leganiere, a newly married employee, was at the
        photocopy machine. He fired several shots at her, killing her, before
        striding toward the cafeteria.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Heidi Rathjen was studying in a lounge when a student
        burst in.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;A guy came in -- he was pale -- he shut the door
        and said there's a guy with a gun out there,&quot; said Rathjen, who
        would later fight to reform Canada's gun laws.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;I didn't really understand what he meant, wasn't
        afraid or anything, until we started hearing what sounded like gunshots.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;It's nothing like what you're used to hearing in
        the movies at all,&quot; she said, comparing the sound with &quot;planks
        of wood hitting the floor.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;We heard gunshots, we heard screams. .. There
        was nothing we could do.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Barbara Maria Klucznik and her husband Witold
        Widajewicz were in the school cafeteria by pure chance. It had the
        lowest prices on campus and, to celebrate the end of term, was offering
        free wine.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Red and white balloons provided a festive atmosphere.
        Klucznik had filled her tray and was at the cashier when people rushed
        into the room and began pushing others, including Widajewicz, into the
        facility's small kitchen, closing the door behind them.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The group lay on the floor, confused. Gunshots rang
        out. Some women began to cry. Some people thought it was a holdup.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The next time Widajewicz saw his high-school
        sweetheart was to identify her dead body. Two other women were slain
        with her in the hail of 20 to 25 bullets from Lepine's .223-calibre
        semi-automatic Sturm Ruger assault rifle.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The gunman raced back into the corridor after shooting
        up the cafeteria. Four women and four men were injured as Lepine bounded
        through the corridor from the cafeteria past billboards announcing jazz
        concerts and Christmas parties.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The first calls to police came around 5:16 p.m. with
        squad cars arriving a minute later, followed by ambulances. But police
        hesitated, waiting for orders. Communications frequencies jammed with
        radio voices.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;When we arrived, we tried to get more
        information,&quot; Brouillette said. &quot;Finally, we received
        information that a girl was supposed to be shot in the cafeteria and me
        and my partner decided to try and save this life.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The two officers entered the building and made their
        way to the cafeteria. They found the wounded woman and placed her on a
        chair, planning to carry her out to the ambulances.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;It was too late,&quot; he said. &quot;She was
        already dead. A few minutes later, we found two more women.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Allan McInnis, who would take the defining picture of
        the tragedy for the Montreal Gazette, remembered the overcast sky above
        the school was a pulsing red and blue from the reflected emergency
        vehicle lights.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;It was very eerie,&quot; he said. &quot;When I
        actually got up to the door, the scene was ambulances and cops running
        back and forth -- chaos.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">He said he still wasn't sure if it was all real and
        not sparked by a horrible end-of-classes prank.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;When I got up there and I saw the first
        stretcher coming out the door ... There was a girl coming out of the
        school and a good part of her chest was exposed and there was a bullet
        hole near her breast.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;She had an oxygen mask on and (I thought) 'Oh my
        God, this is for real -- this is for real.'&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">McInnis later took the heartbreaking picture of one of
        the victims slumped dead in her cafeteria chair as a police officer
        removed a nearby banner that proclaimed Happy New Year.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">As emergency crews arrived, Lepine had already entered
        a third-floor classroom where three students, including Maryse Leclair,
        were wrapping up a presentation to 23 other students and a professor.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lepine ordered the students out. Everybody froze. He
        fired a shot into the ceiling sending everyone under their desks.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Students yelling &quot;get out, get out&quot;
        scrambled from the classroom. Leclair was shot where she stood behind
        the podium and she slumped over it, crying for help.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The gunman stomped around the classroom, leaping atop
        some desks and walking across them. He fired his rifle, pausing
        sometimes to reload. People moaned.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Three more women were shot and killed, another was
        seriously injured and a male student was shot in the arm. When Lepine
        saw Leclair still alive, he walked over to her, unsheathed his knife and
        stabbed her to death.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The killer muttered, &quot;Oh, shit&quot; as he stood
        amid the carnage.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">His rifle went off one last time, into his own face.
        Then there was silence.</font></p>&nbsp;<hr>&nbsp;

        <p align="justify"><b><style="font-size: 8pt">Marc Lepine</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;I have already tried in my youth to enlist in
        the Forces...which would have allowed me to enter the arsenal and
        proceed Lortie in a rampage. They refused me because I'm asocial. So I
        waited until this day to execute all my projects.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Taken from Lepine's suicide note.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Marc Lepine was a bit of a loony. He was obsessed with
        war and violence, neighbours complained about the volume of his TV as he
        watched non-stop war films. He also hated women. The reason for this one
        was quite simple - they didn't like him, or they didn't find him
        attractive. This hatred of women grew into an absolute loathing. Lepine
        ended up labelling all women who didn't want him 'feminist.' He
        particularly hated feminists.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Eventually Lepine found a woman who liked him a little,
        and she became pregnant. For Lepine this was a solution, she couldn't
        get away if they had a child together, and he would have a son.
        Unfortunately for Lepine his girlfriend decided she didn't want a kid,
        and told him she was getting an abortion. For Lepine this was too much,
        and he decided to take the ultimate revenge on all the feminists he
        could.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">December 6, 1989. The last day of term before the
        Christmas break - and the day Lepine would be revenged. He stormed an
        engineering class at the University of Montreal.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;Okay, everybody stop what their doing.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lepine's opening line.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">As Lepine spoke the line he pulled out an automatic
        rifle. He was wearing blue jeans, an anorak and a red baseball cap. The
        students all thought it was a practical joke, until Lepine put a bullet
        into the ceiling.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;Move! Split into two - the girls on the left,
        the guys on the right.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Their were only nine girls in the class of sixty, and
        once gathered Lepine ordered the males to leave. They did, still
        thinking that it must be a prank.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;Do any of you know why I'm here?....</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">I'm here to fight feminism!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lepine then opened fire on the girls - killing six,
        wounding the other three. Lepine then left the room firing
        indiscriminately at the males still outside the room. He was heard
        yelling -</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;I want the women&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lepine reloaded the rifle. He then proceeded to walk
        through the building, killing four more women along the way. He then
        went into room 311 where he killed three more women, and wounded others.
        He then walked up to one of the wounded, drew out a hunting knife and
        ended her suffering with three stabs. The classroom was still full of
        students, all scattered under desks, but Lepine seemed not to notice as
        he took off his anorak, wrapped it around the rifle, and blew his
        baseball cap off (with the assistance of the top of his skull).</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><b><style="font-size: 8pt">INTERESTING BITS</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">The police were not called until 5.17pm. Lepine's
        brains were on the ground at 5.20pm.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">He could have kept going for at least 5 more minutes
        before they could have stopped him.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lepine was another shorty - He was only 5' 6&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">He was born Gamil Gharbi and he later changed it to
        Marc Lepine.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">He was described as a brilliant student, but lost
        interest when he discovered war films.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">He kept a skull on his bookcase.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Amusingly, Lepine was turned down for the Army because
        he was believed to be mentally unstable. He was also turned down by the
        University for a place in the engineering course.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">In his pocket was a hand written note-</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;Forgive the mistakes, I had only 15 minutes to
        write this.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;Please note that if I am committing suicide
        today...it is not for economic reasons...but for political reasons. For
        I have decided to send to their forefathers the feminists who have
        always ruined my life. It has been seven years since that life ceased to
        bring me any joy, and being totally bored, I have decided to put an end
        to those vigaros...&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;Even if the mad killer label is stuck on me by
        the media, I regard myself as a rational and intelligent person who has
        been forced into taking extreme actions... Being rather backward-looking
        by nature (except for science), the feminists have always had a talent
        for enraging me. They want to keep the advantages of women...while
        grabbing those of men.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">Lepine then went on to list 15 women who he deemed 'the
        enemy.'</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;These nearly died today. Lack of time (because I
        started too late) has allowed these radical feminists to survive.&quot;</font></p>

        <p align="justify">MONTREAL - He hoists the rifle to his shoulder, 
        presses his right cheek to the hardwood stock and slowly squeezes the 
        trigger, just like his uncle the paratrooper had taught him as a little 
        boy. The barrel sweeps to the left and stops, his eye now fixed just 
        beyond the front sights.</p>
        <p align="justify">''What are you going after?'' the gun store clerk 
        asks.</p>
        <p align="justify">''Just small game,'' he says, lowering the rifle.</p>
        <p align="justify">He probably noticed the big banner as he walked out 
        of the Montreal gun shop that day: Good luck and good shooting.</p>
        <p align="justify">Just small game.</p>
        <p align="justify">Two months after Marc Lepine stalked his prey in the 
        halls of a Montreal engineering school, the mourners' flowers have 
        wilted but the impossible puzzle of a twisted young mind remains.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine left behind only a few pieces of his macabre 
        jigsaw, scratched on a handwritten suicide note stuffed in his coat 
        pocket underneath a box of unspent rifle shells.</p>
        <p align="justify">Much of it is a tirade against feminists who have ''always 
        ruined my life.''</p>
        <p align="justify">On another line he writes: ''I have been unhappy for 
        the past seven years.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Starting in the summer of 1982.</p>
        <p align="justify">Marc Lepine had never been really happy _ hellish 
        years of child abuse at the hands of a violently chauvinist father; more 
        years of loneliness after his parents split and his mother was out 
        trying to support a family.</p>
        <p align="justify">Only in his teenage years had he found any semblance 
        of happiness, mainly through an intense friendship with a neighborhood 
        chum named Jean Belanger.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was in the summer of 1982 that Monique Lepine sold 
        their house in Pierrefonds and moved with Marc and his younger sister 
        Nadia to another part of Montreal.</p>
        <p align="justify">The rented apartment at 2675 Marlborough Ct. in St. 
        Laurent was a modern two-storey rowhouse in a pleasant suburban 
        neighborhood.</p>
        <p align="justify">And it was much closer to Marc's new junior college 
        and her own nursing director's job at St. Jude's hospital.</p>
        <p align="justify">But it was far enough away from Pierrefonds to break 
        Marc's bonds of friendship with Belanger.</p>
        <p align="justify">He had already been rejected by the army. Now he was 
        spending the summer washing dishes in the kitchen of his mother's 
        hospital.</p>
        <p align="justify">Belanger visited Marlborough Court before they lost 
        touch: ''Marc didn't seem very happy there. We had been together for so 
        long. I guess maybe he was lonely. He didn't have much to do.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine began spending long periods locked in his 
        small bedroom crammed with huge stacks of his beloved books, a wood 
        table where he tinkered with electronics, and a computer_his 
        obsession_donated by one of his mother's friends at the hospital.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine enrolled in a two-year program in pure 
        sciences at CEGEP St. Laurent junior college, continuing his high school 
        path towards engineering school.</p>
        <p align="justify">Perhaps it was his loneliness. Maybe the courses 
        didn't come as easily as they had in high school. At the end of his 
        first term at St. Laurent, he had flunked two subjects, his first 
        academic failures ever.</p>
        <p align="justify">Belanger remembers Lepine telling him he would get 
        home from CEGEP in the evenings and ''just sit in front of his computer 
        and start playing with it. That had become his hobby.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Shortly after Lepine turned 18 that fall, he filed 
        the papers necessary to officially bury Gamil Rodrigue Gharbi, the name 
        given him at birth by the father he loved to hate.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine and his mother lived alone at Marlborough 
        Court for most of the first two years after Nadia went off to boarding 
        school. That was okay with Marc. He despised his sister's taunts.</p>
        <p align="justify">The second term at CEGEP, in the winter of 1983, went 
        much better than the first. His marks ranged from the 70s to the 90s, 
        and he was well on his way to fulfilling a boyhood dream _ to graduate 
        in engineering from Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique.</p>
        <p align="justify">Dec. 6, 1989. In the cluttered turquoise bedroom, he 
        pulls the new Kodiaks over the cuffs of his blue jeans. He loops his 
        belt through the sheath of the hunting knife and buckles it.</p>
        <p align="justify">He reaches for the rifle. The curved 30-round 
        magazine clip of high-powered bullets hangs from the stalk like a 
        rectangular banana. He stuffs the gun into a garbage bag.</p>
        <p align="justify">He folds the letter and puts it in his windbreaker 
        pocket, then jams a box of 20 shells in with it. Another box of them is 
        stuffed in the other pocket.</p>
        <p align="justify">He tugs the ''Tracteur Montreal'' baseball cap down 
        over his forehead, picks up the garbage bag and heads for the rented 
        car.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is just after 4 p.m.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the fall of 1983, Lepine began what would become a 
        long sequence of curious career moves.</p>
        <p align="justify">At the end of his first of two years in pure sciences 
        _ the usual route to engineering school _ he switched into electronics 
        technology, a three-year vocational trades program.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine excelled at his new vocation _ 82 in 
        industrial electronics; 87 in control systems and so on down the list.</p>
        <p align="justify">Marcel Leroux, head of the CEGEP's professional 
        electronics program, said most of the professors can't remember Lepine.</p>
        <p align="justify">''He was not super-brilliant, but neither was he 
        stupid. He really was low profile.''</p>
        <p align="justify">CEGEP director Claude Boily says Lepine was never 
        seen by any of the institution's psychologists ''and there were no 
        reports in his file noting that he had any behavioral problems.''</p>
        <p align="justify">But he was also becoming increasingly hyperactive, 
        always in a hurry. All nerves. And acne. Severe acne that embarrassed 
        him.</p>
        <p align="justify">Nadia's boarding school roommate, Isabelle Lahaie, 
        used to visit the Marlborough Street apartment regularly: ''Marc was a 
        good guy. But he was closed. He had a strange look _ his eyes were lit 
        up, he had the same smile all the time... You could see he was unhappy.''</p>
        <p align="justify">For the next two years, Marc Lepine's world was CEGEP 
        classrooms and his Marlborough Street bedroom.</p>
        <p align="justify">As he headed home for the Christmas holidays that 
        year, Lepine was only nine courses away from graduation _ seven in the 
        winter term, two in the summer.</p>
        <p align="justify">But fifteen days after the winter term began Jan. 31, 
        Lepine simply stopped going to classes.</p>
        <p align="justify">There were no discussions with anyone at the school. 
        No explanations. No notice. Just gone. He was 21.</p>
        <p align="justify">Nadia's former roommate Lahaie speculates: ''That's 
        when Nadia left... to return to live with her mother and get on his (Marc's) 
        back fulltime.</p>
        <p align="justify">''I can still hear Nadia telling me: 'If you really 
        want to get him mad, call him Gamil _ and tell him he is ugly and stupid.' 
        ''</p>
        <p align="justify">The headlights moving along Bordeaux Street have 
        slowed to a solemn procession in the freezing drizzle.</p>
        <p align="justify">There are 15 wrought-iron stairs to the street. 
        Normally, he takes them two at a time. This time he is calm.</p>
        <p align="justify">He climbs in the small car he rented earlier in the 
        day, turns the key and joins the procession down Bordeaux Street.</p>
        <p align="justify">Marc Lepine's life in the winter of 1986 went from 
        strange to weird.</p>
        <p align="justify">Just before _ or just after _ he quit CEGEP in his 
        final term, he applied for admission to engineering at the Ecole 
        Polytechnique.</p>
        <p align="justify">Not surprisingly, he was rejected.</p>
        <p align="justify">Then he enrolled in two summer courses, but dropped 
        them before he started.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine was finished with school for a while.</p>
        <p align="justify">For the next 16 months, the shy brainy kid was 
        washing dishes, serving food and mopping floors at St. Jude's Hospital 
        for the chronically ill.</p>
        <p align="justify">On July 1, 1986, Lepine moved away from his mother _ 
        and his sister.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine's apartment No. 401 was a modern one-bedroom 
        with a small cement balcony on the top floor of a boxy 24-unit block at 
        4185 St. Martin Blvd. in the northwest Montreal suburb of Laval.</p>
        <p align="justify">The $10 an hour he was making at the hospital was 
        plenty to cover his $300 rent. He didn't drink. He didn't smoke. No 
        drugs. No girls.</p>
        <p align="justify">The place was always clean, he never complained, 
        never made trouble for his neighbors. And the rent was always paid on 
        time.</p>
        <p align="justify">Building superintendent Luc Riopel said: ''He was a 
        good guy. But he lived in isolation and did not appear very happy.''.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine was always running, heavy-footed, crashing 
        through doors at full speed. No one complained, except the day he hit 
        the front door so hard he broke off the crash bar.</p>
        <p align="justify">''He told me he didn't like working at the hospital. 
        It was not what he wanted to do for a living. It was just a job for him. 
        His real interest was in computers. And war books. He had a lot of war 
        books... ''</p>
        <p align="justify">The wipers are streaking the freezing rain across the 
        windshield as he turns on to the long, steep drive that leads to the six-storey 
        yellow engineering school at the top of the hill. The parking booth is 
        50 metres up the slope. He pays the attendant $5.</p>
        <p align="justify">The car pulls to a stop in front of the student 
        entrance. A tow-away zone. He doesn't much care. He won't be back for it 
        anyway. The letter in his pocket says so...</p>
        <p align="justify">Dominique Leclair was 19 when she met Lepine that 
        summer in the kitchen at St. Jude's. Her father runs the hospital and 
        was good friends with Monique Lepine when she was his nursing director. 
        He gave Marc his job.</p>
        <p align="justify">But that's not why Dominique befriended Marc Lepine.</p>
        <p align="justify">''I was kind to him because he was so hyperactive and 
        nervous, nobody would talk to him at lunch or break time... Everyone 
        else tried to avoid him because he was a bit strange because of his 
        shyness.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine's hyperactivity and his job didn't mix either.</p>
        <p align="justify">''He was always rushing things. He would never be 
        calm.''</p>
        <p align="justify">He raced the food carts the same way he did 
        everything else. Always in a hurry. Soup got spilled. Dishes got broken.</p>
        <p align="justify">Everytime he made a mess of something, his reaction 
        was always the same: ''Ah shit.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Finally, he was put on food-serving duty in the 
        cafeteria where his pace would at least be tempered by the task. But the 
        steamy kitchen atmosphere had festered his already unsightly acne 
        problem.</p>
        <p align="justify">Dominique recalls: ''The employees would say they 
        didn't want him to serve them their lunch because of his acne. They were 
        mean.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine was stuffed back in the kitchen where no one 
        would have to look at his pimples.</p>
        <p align="justify">He tried growing a beard to hide the acne, but it was 
        scraggly and seemed to make the rest of his complexion worse. He would 
        cut it off and grow it again like a suburban lawn.</p>
        <p align="justify">No matter how hard he might have tried, Lepine just 
        couldn't shed his shyness. Even with Dominique, he would stir his food 
        and stare at the floor when he was speaking.</p>
        <p align="justify">Dominique never had any inkling he might be 
        interested in her romantically. ''Maybe if I had asked him out, okay... 
        But I didn't sense he had any of that feeling. We were just friends.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Part of the problem was Marc Lepine figured he was 
        just plain ugly. That's why he didn't have a girlfriend.</p>
        <p align="justify">Dominique remembers him saying: ''I've asked a lot of 
        girls out, but they have all refused. I know so many girls, but they 
        won't go out with me. I'm not good looking... ''</p>
        <p align="justify">He is walking slowly, 48 paces along the cement path 
        to the four sets of steel and glass doors, the ones beneath the huge 
        sign Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal.</p>
        <p align="justify">The gun in the garbage bag is hanging at his side as 
        he steps into the crowded, noisy foyer. Just another engineering student 
        with another piece of equipment.</p>
        <p align="justify">The college guards in the glass cubicle to the right 
        pay him no heed. Nor do the other students.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is the last hour of the last day of classes before 
        Christmas holidays.</p>
        <p align="justify">In September 1987, after Dominique had gone back to 
        school, Lepine quit the hospital, probably not far ahead of being fired.</p>
        <p align="justify">The next time Dominque heard the name Marc Lepine was 
        the day her first cousin Maryse Leclair died. By sheer coincidence, she 
        was Lepine's last victim.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine turned 23 shortly after he quit the hospital, 
        and enrolled that fall in three courses at the nearby CEGEP Montmorency.</p>
        <p align="justify">His marks were all good: 81 in advanced algebra; 75 
        in a course called the ethics of politics; 84 in mass communications. As 
        in the past, his 15 weeks at the CEGEP were thoroughly unremarkable.</p>
        <p align="justify">After Christmas, he stayed on in his St. Martin 
        apartment and spent most of his free time with a new Apple computer he 
        had bought with his savings from the hospital.</p>
        <p align="justify">On Feb. 29, 1988, two months after his course ended 
        at CEGEP Montmorency, Lepine filled in an application for a computer 
        programming course at the privately-run Control Data Institute in 
        downtown Montreal.</p>
        <p align="justify">He lied about his work at the hospital, and listed 
        ''David Caron, friend'' as the person to contact in case of an emergency. 
        The address he gave for Caron doesn't exist and the phone number was 
        Lepine's own apartment.</p>
        <p align="justify">Not surprisingly, computer whiz Lepine got 90 per 
        cent on his admission test and began to take his courses on March 11. He 
        was 23.</p>
        <p align="justify">The $9,000 fee for the 15-month program was covered 
        by a $5,940 student loan, and the balance by Lepine in $200 monthly 
        instalments which he never missed.</p>
        <p align="justify">Jean Cloutier, director of the institute, described 
        Lepine in familiar terms: ''He was an isolated hard worker. Very much 
        above average... His marks throughout were probably in the top 15 per 
        cent.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Cloutier said about the only thing remotely notable 
        about Lepine was the way he dressed. No blue jeans; they were banned. 
        But he always looked sloppy. Always wore a baseball cap.</p>
        <p align="justify">And the acne. Everyone noticed he had bad acne.</p>
        <p align="justify">In June 1988, Lepine moved downtown from his St. 
        Martin Boulevard apartment in suburban Laval.</p>
        <p align="justify">On moving day, his landlord Riopel recalls that he 
        never mentioned anything about taking computer programming at Control 
        Data _ or anywhere else.</p>
        <p align="justify">''He told me he was going off to join the Armed 
        Forces... ''</p>
        <p align="justify">He is moving up the beige stairwell from the ground 
        floor to the second, new Kodiaks on terrazzo, the stainless steel 
        railing sliding through his free hand. Thirteen steps to the landing. 
        Another 13 to the top. Through the red steel fire doors.</p>
        <p align="justify">Down one hallway, into another and another. The 
        second floor is a maze of confusing corridors, lounges and student 
        supply shops. Room 230 is the only classroom on the floor, hidden at the 
        end of a wide corridor lined with photocopiers, beyond a set of steel 
        doors, the last room at the end of another narrow twisting hall.</p>
        <p align="justify">He must have been there before.</p>
        <p align="justify">Bordeaux Street is typical of blue-collar Montreal _ 
        a narrow one-way collage of overhead wires, parked cars and skinny, red-brick 
        walkups.</p>
        <p align="justify">The second floor apartment at 2175 Bordeaux would be 
        Marc Lepine's last home.</p>
        <p align="justify">The neighborhood wasn't far from Control Data, and 
        Lepine's mother had moved into a new condo three blocks away. The rent 
        was right _ $285 a month _ split with an old high school acquaintance 
        Erik Cossette.</p>
        <p align="justify">He was Lepine's age, a little shorter, with curly 
        blonde hair. A theatre student, the landlord says. Their mothers had 
        kept in touch.</p>
        <p align="justify">Beyond the brown front door with the dirty glass 
        window, the apartment was typical student digs: a narrow hallway with 
        worn-through linoleum. One sickly green bedroom. A smaller one in 
        turquoise. A dilapidated bathroom in deep blue. A dirty beige sitting 
        area. The yellow kitchen.</p>
        <p align="justify">Marc got the small bedroom, about eight-by-ten. His 
        mother helped him paint it turquoise.</p>
        <p align="justify">The size of Lepine's room made it more chaotic than 
        usual. A sofa bed along one wall; the Apple computer and a clutter of 
        electronic parts on the desk in front of the window. The view is a blind 
        alley and a spaghetti of telephone wires.</p>
        <p align="justify">Everywhere there are piles of books, floor to ceiling, 
        two deep. Even in the clothes closet.</p>
        <p align="justify">There are two prints on the wall. One is a war scene. 
        Nothing about women.</p>
        <p align="justify">And there are video-cassettes, lots of them, mostly 
        Pay-TV movies taped from the television and VCR in the sitting room.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lots about war in those.</p>
        <p align="justify">He is through the beige steel doors into a narrow 
        concrete hall. The garbage bag falls off the rifle. Seven paces, then 
        right, then left. He walks slowly through the doorless entrance at the 
        front of the cavernous cement-block classroom.</p>
        <p align="justify">He stops a metre from the two female students giving 
        their fourth-year presentations. He appears calm.</p>
        <p align="justify">He orders the women to move to one side of the room, 
        the men to leave. There are titters. They think it's a prank. He fires a 
        shot into the ceiling.</p>
        <p align="justify">''I want the women,'' he says. ''You're all a bunch 
        of feminists.''</p>
        <p align="justify">''I hate feminists.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Gina Cousineau had never seen him look so dapper, so 
        prosperous, as that evening he walked into the 1988 high school reunion 
        for the class of '82. A black shirt done up to the neck. Black pants. A 
        nicely tailored black sports coat.</p>
        <p align="justify">Marc Lepine had been certain he would find his old 
        pal Jean Belanger at the party, though they hadn't spoken in almost four 
        years.</p>
        <p align="justify">But Belanger was in hospital with a crushed leg after 
        a garage door fell on him.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine called him the next day and told him he was 
        thinking of joining the army. It was the last time they ever spoke.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine spent the entire reunion evening with Gina, 
        Belanger's teenage sweetheart, the third member of the high school happy 
        threesome.</p>
        <p align="justify">Gina remembers the evening well, the last time she 
        would ever see her old friend: ''He looked like he always looked, that 
        big smile. He always had that smile on his face, even if things weren't 
        going so well.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine never strayed far from Gina and her new fiance 
        the whole evening. He always ordered Coke at the bar.</p>
        <p align="justify">Gina asked him if he had a girlfriend: ''He told me, 
        'I had one, but she dumped me.' ''</p>
        <p align="justify">The reunion was in late August 1988. He was almost 
        half-way through Control Data.</p>
        <p align="justify">He never mentioned Control Data.</p>
        <p align="justify">''He told me he had just lost his job and was going 
        back to university in the fall. He didn't mention which one.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Gina asked him how he lost his job at the hospital: 
        ''He said he had made one small mistake during his three-month 
        probationary period and, bang, they told him to get lost.</p>
        <p align="justify">''He told me he had been fired by a woman and that 
        another woman had taken his place.</p>
        <p align="justify">''He was really mad about that... ''</p>
        <p align="justify">There is mayhem in the main corridor outside Room 
        230. The 50-odd men who left as ordered are screaming at people to run. 
        Inside the classroom, six women are dead. The other three are wounded.</p>
        <p align="justify">He is out in the main corridor again, down at the 
        other end by the photocopiers. He keeps his back to the wall. Wheels. 
        Fires. Wheeling and firing again.</p>
        <p align="justify">The wounded are moaning for help. The woman selling 
        posters dives behind her table. He is six paces past her. He stops, 
        turns. The rifle recoils.</p>
        <p align="justify">Sylvie Drouin thought he was a pretty ''good-looking 
        guy'' that first night she walked into the chemistry class in February 
        1989. Five-foot-nine, 160 pounds, curly brown hair. A beard. A baseball 
        cap. Sure, he had bad acne. But she didn't care about stuff like that.</p>
        <p align="justify">She asked him to be her lab partner. Drouin was 28, 
        four years older than Lepine, and already had an arts degree from Laval 
        University. Like him, she is shy.</p>
        <p align="justify">Both of them were also taking the CEGEP chemistry 
        course as a key prerequisite to engineering school.</p>
        <p align="justify">Over the ensuing weeks, Lepine would continue his 
        studies at Control Data in the afternoons from 1 p.m. until 6 p.m., then 
        spend two nights a week at the nearby CEGEP de Vieux Montreal taking the 
        chemistry course.</p>
        <p align="justify">Sylvie Drouin would also become perhaps the closest 
        Marc Lepine could come to a relationship with a woman.</p>
        <p align="justify">It got off to a rocky start: ''The first few weeks in 
        the lab, he was very severe with me. I was never correct. He was being a 
        facist. The lab was never done well enough. He was always right... ''</p>
        <p align="justify">''And he was giving me these orders all the time. 
        Wash those things. Don't do the calculation like that. Go and get 
        something. Do this. Don't do that.''</p>
        <p align="justify">He called her ''fraulein.''</p>
        <p align="justify">After two weeks of harassment, Drouin told him to 
        either back off or find another lab partner. Lepine didn't say much in 
        reply, just frowned and scowled. But he was at least more civil after 
        that.</p>
        <p align="justify">As usual, Lepine mastered the work easily and would 
        get a final mark in the 90s.</p>
        <p align="justify">But Drouin says Lepine was a bundle of nerves sitting 
        next to her. ''He was good at the theory, but at practical things he was 
        no good. He was so nervous, he would make mistakes. His mind would 
        wander. He would put too many drops in the solution, that kind of thing.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Every time Lepine would make a mistake, something 
        that made him angry at himself, his reaction was always the same.</p>
        <p align="justify">''Ah shit.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Drouin was taking another night course in computers 
        and asked if he would help with her homework. She suggested maybe she 
        could come to his place.</p>
        <p align="justify">''He was really pleased to help. He needed to feel 
        important to other people.''</p>
        <p align="justify">The next night, Drouin made the first of a dozen 
        visits to Bordeaux Street over the ensuing three months.</p>
        <p align="justify">''In the beginning, he was a lot of fun. I remember 
        the first time I walked in and he told me to sit on the chair and he 
        showed me all these things he could do with his computer _ colors, three-dimensional 
        stuff, that kind of thing.''</p>
        <p align="justify">But Lepine wasn't so much interested in helping as 
        impressing. ''He didn't want to do them (the problems) with me. He 
        didn't teach me. He just wanted to solve the problems himself and hand 
        them to me.''</p>
        <p align="justify">He didn't want to talk about his family. ''He just 
        said, 'Oh, I have a mother in Montreal.' That's all.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Every night Sylvie visited Bordeaux Street, Lepine 
        would always insist on walking her back to her bus. Very gentlemanly. 
        But that was it.</p>
        <p align="justify">She certainly wasn't pressing him into a romance: ''I 
        think in his mind, the girl has to worship everything he does, that 
        everything he does is right. Like in those first few labs...</p>
        <p align="justify">''If you follow him and his ways, things are fine. If 
        you don't, there is nothing. He gets very cold and withdrawn.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Drouin's initial attraction to Lepine had evaporated: 
        ''I like the different kind, not whackos, but different. But to be with 
        a guy like that, you would have to give your whole life to him, just 
        follow him.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Early in their relationship, Drouin made the mistake 
        of casually asking Lepine if he had a girlfriend. ''He was surprised I 
        would even ask the question. He got mad. He said, 'What do you want to 
        know that for?' So I shut up... ''</p>
        <p align="justify">He turns through the student lounge. Left again, the 
        rifle sweeping air. He moves along a now empty corridor. New Kodiaks on 
        red tile floor. He is at the end. He starts to turn left. He stops. A 
        door clicks shut behind him. A female employee of the finance department 
        is just closing up for the night.</p>
        <p align="justify">He spins. The gun cracks once. Then again. And again.</p>
        <p align="justify">He wheels back into the stairwell. A student who has 
        come to check out the commotion freezes. He is male. The gunman laughs 
        and disappears down the stairs.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was March 31, 1989. Lepine was two months and two 
        relatively easy courses away from finishing his computer programming 
        work at Control Data.</p>
        <p align="justify">At 6 p.m. that day, he signed out on the attendance 
        sheet and never came back.</p>
        <p align="justify">Institute director Cloutier says everyone there was 
        completely baffled: ''With his background in electronics, plus his high 
        standings in programming, he was well on his way to becoming a computer 
        genius.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine returned some books to the institute two weeks 
        later and mentioned in passing he had decided to change careers. They 
        never saw him again.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine never mentioned it to Sylvie, pretending for 
        the next two months that he was still enrolled. But she noticed his mood 
        slowly started to change.</p>
        <p align="justify">''He slowly got more difficult to communicate with. 
        He became very withdrawn and closed.''</p>
        <p align="justify">In the chemistry class, lab assistant Andre Tremblay 
        remembers Lepine's eyes were perpetually bloodshot, as though he weren't 
        sleeping.</p>
        <p align="justify">Drouin tried to include him in her social life, but 
        to no avail.</p>
        <p align="justify">''Once we had a party on a Thursday night in a bar 
        downtown and I asked him if he wanted to come. He was alone and he 
        seemed very down.</p>
        <p align="justify">''He just said, 'No, I don't drink and I never go in 
        that kind of place.' There was no discussion.''</p>
        <p align="justify">The only time he ever asked her to stay late during 
        one of her visits was to watch one of the movies he had on VCR.</p>
        <p align="justify">''They were pretty well all violent stuff, not just 
        war films but science fiction, police movies. I told him I didn't like 
        violence and went home.''</p>
        <p align="justify">One day, Lepine arrived in chemistry class with a 
        full-page story from a Montreal tabloid about a policewoman named Angele 
        who had just saved an old man from a burning house.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine didn't think women should be on the police 
        force. They weren't big enough or strong enough.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lab instructor Tremblay remembers Lepine making the 
        bizarre remark that there were only six women on the Montreal police 
        force.</p>
        <p align="justify">How did he know that? Tremblay asked, suggesting 
        there must be far more.</p>
        <p align="justify">''And he said, 'To date, I have only found the names 
        of six of them in newspaper stories... ' ''</p>
        <p align="justify">The last time Sylvie Drouin saw Lepine at Bordeaux 
        Street was one afternoon about a week after the last chemistry class.</p>
        <p align="justify">''I had come away from there with a very strange 
        feeling like I would never see him again, that I didn't want to see him 
        again and I didn't. I told him I might call in the summer but I never 
        did.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine was ''very strange, in a very hurried state, 
        like someone with something very important on his mind. It was as though 
        he had something to do that no one else could know about... ''</p>
        <p align="justify">Sylvie Drouin had been accepted into engineering at 
        the University of Quebec in Trois Rivieres.</p>
        <p align="justify">Marc Lepine told her he was going to the Ecole 
        Polytechnique in the fall.</p>
        <p align="justify">The stairwell from the second floor empties into the 
        foyer near the main doors where he had entered the school minutes before. 
        He is 15 steps away from them. The rented car is still there. He can see 
        it. He could leave. But he doesn't.</p>
        <p align="justify">He moves across the foyer to the huge cafeteria.</p>
        <p align="justify">There are people everywhere. The gun recoils. And 
        again. And again. Then pandemonium. Three more young women dead.</p>
        <p align="justify">He is back in the foyer by the main doors. Again, he 
        could leave. But he doesn't.</p>
        <p align="justify">Erik Cossette never did notice anything particularly 
        alarming about his roommate on Bordeaux Street.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine was ''emotionally repressed,'' a dud with 
        women, and while he often made sexist remarks, those were ''no more 
        disturbing than what one hears from many men.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Cossette describes a quiet intellectual, fascinated 
        by technology, intrigued by history and world politics, and always happy 
        to help a friend.</p>
        <p align="justify">''Doing favors was his way of expressing his 
        affection for people.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Cossette said Lepine had become an avid reader of gun 
        magazines, but it just seemed to be ''an interest like any other.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Sometime around the end of the summer, Cossette 
        decided to go backpacking in South America and moved out of Bordeaux 
        Street.</p>
        <p align="justify">On Aug. 29, Lepine walked into the Montreal 
        headquarters of the Quebec Provincial Police to pick up an application 
        form for a firearms acquisition certificate.</p>
        <p align="justify">As he was leaving the building, he ran into his 
        sister Nadia's old boarding school friend Isabelle Lahaie.</p>
        <p align="justify">''He told me he was finding out how to get a gun. He 
        said it was for hunting.''</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine was back at the police station Sept. 4, Labor 
        Day, with the completed application and his $10 fee.</p>
        <p align="justify">As long as he was not a mental patient and had no 
        record of violent crimes, Lepine would be licensed to buy as many guns 
        as he could afford.</p>
        <p align="justify">As it happened, his application got buried in the pre-hunting 
        season rush and permit No. AA2092373 did not arrive at Bordeaux Street 
        until mid-October.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was about that time the clerks in the Checkmate 
        Sports store on St. Hubert Street remember first seeing Lepine browsing 
        among the gun racks, asking a lot of questions.</p>
        <p align="justify">Since Cossette had left, Lepine's cousin, Michel 
        Thiery, had moved in to Bordeaux Street. He was a couple of years 
        younger than Lepine, blonde and clean-shaven.</p>
        <p align="justify">The neighbors didn't notice anything unusual about 
        Lepine in the fall. There were his calls for grocery deliveries. A bit 
        odd. The store is right across the street.</p>
        <p align="justify">And there was the late-night laughter. One voice. No 
        other sound.</p>
        <p align="justify">He is back in the stairwell. Up 13 stairs to the 
        landing. Up another flight to the second floor. Up two more flights and 
        through the red doors with the sloppy ''3'' magic markered over them. He 
        turns right, past a wide corridor. Past the security office with the 
        closed door and frosted glass.</p>
        <p align="justify">He turns right, down the second corridor. It is 22 
        paces to Room 311, one of three classrooms on the left. He looks through 
        the glass in the door. He is smiling when he enters the room at the 
        front. Someone has just pulled the fire alarm. The bells are clanging in 
        his ears.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was around 1:30 p.m. on Nov. 21 and Lepine was 
        making his last visit to Checkmate Sports on St. Hubert Street.</p>
        <p align="justify">Ninety minutes later, Lepine had chosen a Sturm Ruger 
        Mini-14, the same kind a lot of police SWAT teams use. The weapon is a 
        semi-automatic. Fires each time the trigger is pulled without reloading.</p>
        <p align="justify">The gun comes with a five-shot magazine. Lepine asks 
        for a banana clip that will spit 30 bullets, one after another, into the 
        chamber. Just pull the trigger.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine grabbed five of the powder blue boxes stamped 
        ''Remington 223'' from the assortment of ammunition piled a metre high 
        in the middle of the floor. Twenty shells in each. A hundred rounds.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is a critical choice.</p>
        <p align="justify">The bullets Lepine bought have solid slugs that go in 
        one side of a target and clean out the other, not like hunting shells 
        that expand on impact and blow the insides out of an animal.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine bought them because they are the cheapest 
        ammunition.</p>
        <p align="justify">Store owner Gilbert Rosenberg would later say: ''If 
        Lepine had known what he was doing when he was buying the shells, the 13 
        people injured (at Ecole Polytechnique) would be dead today.''</p>
        <p align="justify">The clerk suggests Lepine buy a carrying case. The 
        folks on the bus might take an open assault rifle the wrong way.</p>
        <p align="justify">The total on the bill comes to $765.03, but Lepine 
        doesn't have enough money. He is embarrassed.</p>
        <p align="justify">''Ah, shit,'' he said.</p>
        <p align="justify">He leaves a $100 deposit, says he is going to his 
        bank and is back with the cash in less than 30 minutes.</p>
        <p align="justify">Shortly before 4 p.m., Marc Lepine carried the black 
        rectangular plastic case out of the store.</p>
        <p align="justify">They thought they had heard something that sounded 
        like shots about two minutes before. The female student giving a 
        presentation at the front of Room 311 had paused, then continued.</p>
        <p align="justify">Suddenly, he bursts into the room and orders everyone 
        out. Maybe just the men. No one can quite remember. No one moves. 
        Another joke. He fires a shot. Everyone is diving under desks, cowering. 
        Terrified.</p>
        <p align="justify">There is another sudden burst of gunfire. Blood on 
        the desks. More on the floor. Someone is moaning. Now he is walking 
        across the desks.</p>
        <p align="justify">Monique Lepine last saw her son on Sat. Dec. 2, four 
        days before his rampage.</p>
        <p align="justify">She would later tell friends she could recall no 
        peculiar behavior, no telling comment. No final hug. Nothing unusual.</p>
        <p align="justify">The landlord also dropped by Bordeaux Street several 
        times that weekend to collect the December rent. No one answered the 
        door. No one answered his subsequent phone calls.</p>
        <p align="justify">For the first time, the forever meticulous Lepine had 
        not paid his rent on time.</p>
        <p align="justify">On Monday evening, Dec. 4, the First Choice pay-TV 
        channel in Montreal featured an extraordinarily violent Chuck Connors 
        film, dubbed into French, called Commando Terreur.</p>
        <p align="justify">The film is about two terrorists who take students 
        hostage in their school. Some of them are shot. The terrorists are Arab.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lepine watched a lot of violent films, and he was a 
        subscriber to the pay-channel. It is not known if he tuned in the movie 
        that night.</p>
        <p align="justify">At some point in his final days, Lepine sat down and 
        penned his now infamous three-page suicide note, essentially a eulogy to 
        personal failures.</p>
        <p align="justify">He bemoans that he was rejected by the army for what 
        he calls ''anti-social behavior.''</p>
        <p align="justify">And most of all, ''feminists have always ruined my 
        life.''</p>
        <p align="justify">On the third page are listed the names of 15 
        prominent women, including six female police officers _ the same ones he 
        had discussed with his chemistry instructor eight months before.</p>
        <p align="justify">The letter is not a blind rage. Some of it reflects 
        an eerie sense of calm and rational thought.</p>
        <p align="justify">He instructs that his old refrigerator be given to 
        his landlord in lieu of the month's rent he hasn't paid.</p>
        <p align="justify">The rest _ his books, the computer, his bicycle _ 
        will go to his childhood pal Jean Belanger.</p>
        <p align="justify">He is thinking about the end. Getting his house in 
        order like anyone dying of a terminal disease.</p>
        <p align="justify">The letter begins: ''I will die on December 6, 
        1989.''</p>
        <p align="justify">It ends: ''Marc.''</p>
        <p align="justify">He is at the front of the classroom, at the lecturn 
        where she had been giving her term-end presentation when he walked in 
        and shot her. Three other women in the room are dead. She is moaning.</p>
        <p align="justify">He pulls the knife from the sheaf on his belt. It is 
        not like a trigger that causes detached targets to fall. Not like the 
        trigger that is about to blow the top off his own head.</p>
        <p align="justify">The moaning stops. There is blood on his hand. Blood 
        on the blade. The knife clatters to the tile floor.</p>
        <p align="justify">They hear his last two words.</p>
        <p align="justify">''Ah shit.''</font></font></td>

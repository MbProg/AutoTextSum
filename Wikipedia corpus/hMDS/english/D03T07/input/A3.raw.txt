Description
The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department records - Sirhan Sirhan case file contains twelve cubic feet of textual and photographic                                        records covering the period of his confinement by the Sheriff's Department following the assassination of Senator Robert F.                                        Kennedy in 1968. The materials consist of two groups of records, the Sheriff's Department office files and a partial transcript                                        of the proceedings during Sirhan Sirhan's trial.
Background
In the early hours of June 5, 1968, New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy addressed a crowd of his supporters at the Ambassador                                        Hotel in Los Angeles.  Senator Kennedy, a candidate for President of the United States, had just won the California Democratic                                        Primary. Winning the California primary was critical to his quest for the Democratic Party nomination. Senator Kennedy concluded                                        his victory speech and then stepped from the stage and proceeded to walk through a kitchen pantry area of the hotel, shaking                                        hands with some of the people who had gathered to see him. Shots were fired and Senator Kennedy and five other people were                                        wounded in the shooting. Senator Kennedy died the next day as a result of his wounds.

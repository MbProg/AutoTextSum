Details: Robert F. Kennedy was a United States Senator.
After winning the California primary election for Democratic nomination for President of the United States, he was shot in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel and died twenty-six hours later at Good Samaritan Hospital.
His assassin was Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian immigrant, but reviews of the shooting caught on audiotape suggest a possible second gunman present who shot a security guard.

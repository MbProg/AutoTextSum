            <p>An accused person may appear personally, and may conduct his or her own case: ss&nbsp;36(1), 37(2) <i>Criminal Procedure Act</i> 1986. These provisions apply &#8220;to all offences, however arising (whether under an Act or at common law), whenever committed
               and in whatever court dealt with&#8221;: s&nbsp;28(1) <i>Criminal Procedure Act</i>. While the election by an accused to appear self-represented is a fundamental right which should not be interfered with (<i>R&nbsp;v&nbsp;Zorad</i> (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at&nbsp;95) the operation of the adversarial system &#8220;may be severely impaired&#8221; by the absence of legal representation:
               <i>Mansfield&nbsp;v&nbsp;Director of Public Prosecutions</i> <i>(WA)</i> (2006) 226 CLR 486 at&nbsp;[49]. The High Court in <i>Dietrich&nbsp;v&nbsp;The Queen</i> (1992) 177 CLR 292 at&nbsp;302 describes the disadvantages facing a self-represented accused. See also Judicial Commission of
               NSW, <i>Equality before the Law Bench Book</i>, 2006&#8211;, &#8220;Self-represented parties&#8221; at&nbsp;[<a href="/web/20160404140124/http://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/equality/section10.pdf" target="_top">10.1</a>]ff.

            <p>The duty of the trial judge is to give information and advice as is necessary to ensure that the self-represented accused
               receives a fair trial so that &#8220;the accused is put in a position where he [or she] is able to make an effective choice as to
               the exercise of his [or her] rights during the course of the trial, but it is not [the judge&#8217;s] duty to tell the accused how
               to exercise those rights&#8221;: <i>R&nbsp;v&nbsp;Zorad</i> (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at&nbsp;99; <i>R&nbsp;v&nbsp;Anastasiou (aka Peters)</i> (1991) 21 NSWLR 394 at&nbsp;399. The trial judge must maintain the appearance of impartiality and should ascertain the level of
               assistance required by a self-represented accused: <i>Kenny&nbsp;v&nbsp;Ritter</i> [2009] SASC 139 at&nbsp;[23]. A judge is entitled to peruse committal papers to inform himself or herself about the likely scope
               of the trial and potential evidentiary or other issues that might arise: <i>R&nbsp;v&nbsp;SY</i> [2004] NSWCCA 297 at&nbsp;[13]. The judge may also, of course, ask the Crown to give an outline of the Crown case and the nature
               of the evidence to be&nbsp;led.

            <p>The suggested advice and information below assumes that the Crown has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the self-represented
               accused is &#8220;equipped to respond&#8221; to the Crown case in accordance with the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW),
               Prosecution Guidelines, Guideline 23, <i>Unrepresented Accused Persons</i>. The suggested advice and information also assumes that the issues of whether proceedings should be stayed, or whether the
               trial will proceed as a judge-alone trial, have already been resolved. Where the trial is by judge-alone trial, the suggested
               information and advice will require appropriate amendment.
            </p>
            <p>It is a matter of discretion for the trial judge as to whether aspects of the following suggested advice and information are
               provided to the accused, prior to, or after, the Crown Prosecutor opens its case. Given the length of the suggested guidance,
               the judge may prefer to deal with the issues in more than one stage. Consideration might also be given to the provision of
               the suggested advice and information to the accused in written form. If the issue of an alibi is raised by a self-represented
               accused at the beginning of the trial and notice has not been given to the Crown, then, depending on the circumstances, it
               might be necessary to consider a short adjournment: see <b>Alibi</b> at&nbsp;[<a href="alibi.html#p6-010">6-010</a>].

               <h4><a name="d5e7835"></a>Before empanelling the jury
               </h4>
               <p>You have been charged with &#8230; [<i>state offence(s)</i>]. There are a number of essential ingredients or elements to that charge(s) which the Crown must prove beyond reasonable
                  doubt &#8230; [<i>detail elements of offence(s)</i>]. As this is a criminal trial, the burden or obligation to prove you are guilty is placed squarely on the Crown. That burden
                  rests upon the Crown in respect of every ingredient or essential fact that makes up the offence with which you have been charged.
                  There is no obligation whatsoever on you to prove any fact or issue that is in dispute. You do not have any obligation to
                  call any evidence or prove anything.
               </p>
               <h4><a name="d5e7839"></a>Role of judge and jury
               </h4>
               <p>I should explain my role and the role of the jury in the trial. The jury is the sole judge of the facts. All disputes about
                  matters of fact in this case will be decided by the jury and not me. Generally that means that it is entirely up to the jury
                  to decide what evidence they accept and what evidence they do not accept. I am not involved in making decisions about the
                  facts. I am the judge of the law. During the trial this means that I am required to ensure that all the rules of procedure
                  and evidence are followed. At the end of the trial, I will give the jury directions about the legal principles that apply
                  to the case. I will explain to them how the legal principles should be applied to the issues which they have to decide.
               </p>
               <h4><a name="d5e7841"></a>Legal argument
               </h4>
               <p>Sometimes during the trial a question of law will arise for me to decide. This might include arguments about whether particular
                  evidence should be admitted. I may need to hear arguments from the Crown Prosecutor and from you before I make a decision.
                  If that occurs, it is usually necessary for the matter to be debated in the absence of the&nbsp;jury.
               </p>
               <h4><a name="d5e7843"></a>Opening addresses
               </h4>
               <p>After the jury has been empanelled, I will ask the Crown Prosecutor to give an outline of the case the Crown anticipates establishing
                  by the evidence. The purpose of the opening is to assist the jury in understanding the evidence as it is given during the
                  trial. What the Crown tells the jury in the outline is not evidence. It is nothing more than an outline of what the Crown
                  expects the evidence will establish. After the Crown Prosecutor has completed [<i>his/her</i>] address you have the right to address the jury yourself. Your address can refer to any issues which you dispute or which
                  you do not dispute. However, at this stage, your address must be limited to the matters dealt with in the prosecutor&#8217;s opening
                  address and, if you wish, to the matters you propose to raise in your defence &#8230; [<i>see</i> s&nbsp;159(1),&nbsp;(2) <i>Criminal Procedure Act</i> 1986]. Like the Crown Prosecutor&#8217;s opening address, what you say to the jury at this stage is not evidence. You do not have
                  to address the jury. That is up to&nbsp;you.
               </p>
               <p><b>[</b><i><b>Note:</b> It may be appropriate to empanel the jury after these opening remarks: see [<a href="outline_of_trial_procedure.html#p1-015">1-015</a>] below; and once that has been completed, continue with the following comments in the jury&#8217;s absence.</i><b>]</b></p>
               <h4><a name="d5e7855"></a>Explanation of the Crown case and objections
               </h4>
               <p>You have heard the Crown Prosecutor explain to the jury the nature of the charge(s) and the Crown&#8217;s case against you. When
                  the jury is brought back into court, the Crown Prosecutor will call witnesses and produce documents or other material, to
                  seek to prove the charge(s).
               </p>
               <p>[<i>If it is considered more appropriate to give this information and advice before the jury has been empanelled, this part of
                     the advice could read:</i></p>
               <p>Once the Crown Prosecutor explains to the jury the nature of the charge(s) and the Crown&#8217;s case against you, [<i>he/she</i>] will call witnesses and produce documents or other material, to seek to prove the charge(s).<b>]</b></p>
               <p>Documents and other material tendered in evidence during the trial are marked as exhibits. The exhibits are used by the jury
                  in its deliberations.
               </p>
               <p>You can object to any question asked by the Crown Prosecutor if you have a legal basis for doing so. An example of a legal
                  basis for an objection is that a question is not relevant or it is unfair. If you want to object to any question, after it
                  is asked but before it has been answered, you must stand up and say &#8220;I object&#8221;. I will then hear whatever you want to say
                  about the question, and depending on why you are objecting, I may do so in the absence of the jury. You cannot object simply
                  because you disagree with the evidence. If you are unsure about your right to object to a question on legal grounds, you should
                  ask me for assistance.
               </p>
               <p>If the Crown seeks to tender material such as a document, photograph, video or other item, you have the right to object to
                  its tender if there is a legal basis for the objection. If you want me to rule on the tender of any such material you should
                  stand up and say, &#8220;I object&#8221;, and I will then hear whatever you want to say. Again, I may do so in the absence of the&nbsp;jury.
               </p>
               <h4><a name="d5e7865"></a>Cross-examination of Crown witnesses
               </h4>
               <p><b>[</b><i><b>Note:</b> The following does <b>not</b> apply to cross-examination of complainants in prescribed sexual offence proceedings and vulnerable witnesses in personal
                     violence proceedings: see [<a href="outline_of_trial_procedure.html#p1-020">1-020</a>] below which addresses that scenario.</i><b>]</b></p>
               <p>You have the right to cross-examine a Crown witness: that is, to ask him or her any questions which you think may help you,
                  or weaken the Crown case. However, they must be questions, not statements or comments by you. If a Crown witness is able to
                  say something or has material which you think will assist your case [<i>give example, possibly an earlier inconsistent statement of an alleged victim who is a witness</i>], then you can ask the witness questions and tender in evidence that material through the witness. If there is evidence you
                  want the jury to consider which affects the reliability of the witness or the witness&#8217;s evidence [<i>give examples &#8212; related to witness&#8217;s memory, or potentially unreliable evidence or witnesses referred to in s&nbsp;165 Evidence
                     Act such as identification evidence, prison informers, etc</i>], then you may test that by asking the witness questions.
               </p>
               <p>If you are going to contradict the evidence of a Crown witness or suggest that the witness is telling lies, you should make
                  your allegations to that witness in the form of questions, so that he or she has the opportunity to respond to your suggestions.
                  It is also important for you to remember that any suggestion in a question you have asked during cross-examination is not
                  evidence, unless the witness agreed with that suggestion. So, for example, if you ask a witness [<i>give example, &#8220;you saw me wearing a grey jumper on [date], didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</i>], and the witness says &#8220;no&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember&#8221;, there is no evidence to support the particular question
                  you have&nbsp;asked.
               </p>
               <p><b>[</b><i><b>Note:</b> The rule in <i>Browne&nbsp;v&nbsp;Dunn</i> does not generally apply in criminal trials: <i>MWJ&nbsp;v&nbsp;The Queen</i> (2005) 80 ALJR 329 at&nbsp;[41].</i><b>]</b></p>
               <h4><a name="d5e7888"></a>Defence case
               </h4>
               <h4><a name="d5e7889"></a>No case to answer
               </h4>
               <p>After the Crown Prosecutor has called all the Crown evidence, you will be given the opportunity to submit to me that the Crown
                  case should be taken away from the jury because there is not enough evidence to prove the charge(s) against you. This application
                  is made in the absence of the jury. You do not have to do&nbsp;this.
               </p>
               <h4><a name="d5e7891"></a>Opportunity to present any evidence
               </h4>
               <p>If you do not make such an application, or you make an application and it is rejected, you will then be given an opportunity
                  to present any evidence you wish to answer the Crown case. You do not have to give evidence yourself and you do not have to
                  call any witnesses to give evidence on your behalf. The Crown has to prove the case against you. You do not have to prove
                  anything.
               </p>
               <p>However, if you are calling any evidence, either by giving evidence yourself or by calling other witnesses, you may, if you
                  wish, first address the jury &#8230; [<i>see</i> s&nbsp;159(3) <i>Criminal Procedure Act</i>]. The purpose of addressing the jury before you call your evidence is to give them a general outline of the case you are
                  going to present. During that address you cannot attack the Crown case. You have the opportunity to do that later, in your
                  final address, after all the evidence has been&nbsp;given.
               </p>
               <p>You may give evidence yourself, or choose not to give evidence. If you choose not to give evidence, I will direct the jury
                  that you are entitled to say nothing and make the Crown prove your guilt and that your silence in court cannot be used against
                  you &#8230; [<i>see</i> Suggested Direction at&nbsp;[<a href="election_of_accused_not_to_offer_explanation.html#p2-1010">2-1010</a>]].
               </p>
               <p>Even if you do not give evidence, you can still call other witnesses to give evidence which is relevant to the charge(s).
                  You may also tender any relevant documents or other things as exhibits in your case. If you intend to give evidence yourself
                  and to call other witnesses, it is normal to give your own evidence before calling those witnesses because, if you give evidence
                  after any of your witnesses, the comment may be made that you have tailored your own evidence to fit in with the evidence
                  given by them &#8230; [<i>see R&nbsp;v&nbsp;RPS</i> <i>(unrep, 13/8/97, NSWCCA) at&nbsp;23</i>]. But if you decide not to call evidence, I will direct the jury that decision cannot be used against you either.
               </p>
               <p>I remind you again that you do not have to give evidence or call witnesses to give evidence on your behalf. It is entirely
                  a matter for the Crown to prove its case against you. You do not have to prove anything.
               </p>
               <h4><a name="d5e7905"></a>Questioning witnesses
               </h4>
               <p>When you do call your own witnesses, you may ask them questions. However, you cannot ask your own witnesses a leading question.
                  A leading question is one which suggests the answer to the witness. [<i>Give example, &#8220;You&#8217;re a good bloke aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</i>] If you do ask a leading question, then the Crown is likely to object.
               </p>
               <p>In some circumstances you may, with the leave of the court, question a witness you have called as though you were cross-examining
                  the witness.
               </p>
               <p>[<i>Optional explanation to accused of s&nbsp;38 Evidence Act 1995</i></p>
               <p>You may wish to do this because the witness has given evidence that is unfavourable to you, or the witness has not made a
                  genuine attempt to give evidence about a matter which he or she may reasonably be expected to have knowledge of, or the witness
                  has given a prior statement which is inconsistent with the evidence he or she has given in court.]
               </p>
               <p>If that occurs, I will make a legal ruling about whether you can cross-examine your own witness. If leave is granted, you
                  may ask him or her any questions which you think may help you, or weaken the Crown&nbsp;case.
               </p>
               <p>The Crown has the right to cross-examine the witnesses you call. At the conclusion of the Crown&#8217;s cross-examination, you may
                  ask each witness further questions to explain or contradict matters put to them in cross-examination which they might have
                  been unable to explain or contradict during the cross-examination itself.
               </p>
               <p>It is also very important that all the evidence you want the jury to hear is given during your&nbsp;case.</p>
               <h4><a name="d5e7916"></a>Closing addresses
               </h4>
               <p>When all of the evidence has been presented, both you and the Crown Prosecutor have the opportunity to address the jury again.
                  The Crown Prosecutor will address the jury first. After that, you will have the opportunity, if you wish, to address the jury.
                  At that time, you may present arguments as to why the jury should not accept the Crown case against you, or as to why you
                  should be found &#8220;not guilty&#8221;. At that stage, you can discuss the evidence already given, but you cannot introduce new evidence.
                  You will be entitled to refer in your address to all of the evidence that the jury has heard or seen. This includes any exhibit
                  which has been put into evidence, and includes your own evidence if you have given evidence. As I have already said, any suggestion
                  in a question you have asked one of the Crown&#8217;s witnesses during cross-examination or one of your own witnesses is not evidence
                  unless the witness agreed with the suggestion put to&nbsp;them.
               </p>
               <p>You must understand that if, during your address, you assert facts about the charge(s) which are not supported by the evidence,
                  I may give the Crown permission to make a supplementary address or another address to the jury replying to any such assertion
                  [<i>see</i> s&nbsp;160(2) <i>Criminal Procedure Act</i>].
               </p>
               <p>If you would like me to further explain anything I have told you, please let me know now, or when the particular matter arises.</p>
               <h4><a name="d5e7923"></a>[Other general comments
               </h4>
               <p>Other general comments may be necessary depending on the nature of the case. These comments should be made before the jury
                  has been empanelled.<b>]</b></p>
               <p>[<i><b>Where appropriate</b> &#8212; admission to an investigating official</i></p>
               <p>In this case, the Crown alleges that you have made an admission to an investigating official. It is for the judge in the trial
                  to decide whether an admission you may have made should be admitted in evidence. I decide those issues by hearing evidence
                  from the witnesses to whom you are said to have made the alleged admission. If you wish to contest the evidence of the admission,
                  then you should tell me now, and I will deal with the issue before the jury is empanelled.<b>]</b></p>
               <p>[<i><b>Where appropriate</b> &#8212; good character</i></p>
               <p>If you want to suggest to the jury that you are a person of good character either generally or in a particular respect, then
                  you are entitled to raise that good character for their consideration. You may do this by either asking appropriate questions
                  of Crown witnesses, or by stating this during your evidence, and/or by calling witnesses to give evidence to that effect.
                  [<i>For example, if you do not have a criminal history, then you may wish to ask one of the Crown witnesses a question about that</i>.]
               </p>
               <p>However, it is important for you to understand that if you, either directly or by implication, suggest to a witness that you
                  are a person of good character either generally or in a particular respect then, depending on his or her answer, the Crown
                  may lead evidence to rebut your suggestion that you are a person of good character. This may include evidence of any criminal
                  record you might have.<b>]</b></p>
               <p>[<i><b>Where appropriate </b>&#8212; alibi</i></p>
               <p>If you wish to rely upon an alibi: that is, to suggest either by cross-examination of Crown witnesses, during your own evidence,
                  or by calling witnesses in your case, that you were not at a relevant place at the relevant time, but were somewhere else,
                  then, unless you have already given notice of that alibi to the Crown, you may not do so unless you first obtain the leave
                  of the court.<b>]</b></p>

               <p>[<i>Name of the accused</i>], the law requires that you be tried by a jury of 12 people chosen from those members of the public forming the jury panel
                  who are presently in court. Each potential juror has been given a number. They are referred to by that number and not by their
                  names. Twelve cards will now be drawn, at random, from a box, one by one. Each of the 12 people selected will then take a
                  seat in the jury box over there. Each person will then be called again, one by&nbsp;one.

               <p>You have a legal right to challenge a maximum of three people without giving any reason. If you do wish to challenge a particular

               </p>
               <p>In addition, if you want to challenge a particular person for a specific reason, then you should, without stating your reason,
                  say, &#8220;challenge for cause&#8221;. I will deal with that situation, if it arises [<i>see</i> s&nbsp;46 <i>Jury Act</i> 1977]. Do you understand?

                     <p><i>Stay of proceeding</i>: even if a self-represented accused is aware of his or her right to make an application for an adjournment or stay of the
                        proceedings to enable legal representation to be obtained, the trial judge should consider whether the trial is likely to
                        be unfair if the accused is forced to proceed unrepresented: <i>Dietrich&nbsp;v&nbsp;The Queen</i> (1992) 177 CLR&nbsp;292.
                     </p>
                     <p>Where a self-represented accused, &#8220;who through no fault on his or her part, is unable to obtain legal representation&#8221; and
                        is facing trial for serious offences, a trial judge has power to make an order staying the proceedings if, in the circumstances
                        of the case, it appears that the accused would otherwise not receive a fair trial: <i>Dietrich&nbsp;v&nbsp;The Queen</i> at&nbsp;315. See also <i>R&nbsp;v&nbsp;Gilfillan</i> (2003) 139 A Crim R 460 where the Court of Criminal Appeal noted at&nbsp;[75] that circumstances may exist where it is reasonable
                        for an accused to withdraw his or her instructions even at an advanced stage of a trial, and that although there is a strong
                        public interest in ensuring that a criminal trial which is well advanced proceeds to a verdict, the court is required to consider
                        why instructions were withdrawn.
                     </p>
                     <p>In <i>Craig&nbsp;v&nbsp;South Australia</i> (1995) 184 CLR 163 at&nbsp;184, the High Court considered the phrase, &#8220;through no fault of his own&#8221;, and concluded that the test
                        focused on the reasonableness of the accused&#8217;s conduct in all of the circumstances, and excluded the situation where it was
                        fair to say the accused &#8220;by his gratuitous and unreasonable conduct, had been the author of his own misfortune&#8221;.

                     <p><i>Address by the Crown Prosecutor:</i> the Crown is not prohibited from making a closing address where the accused is self-represented, although there is a practice
                        that the Crown not do so in such circumstances: <i>R&nbsp;v&nbsp;Zorad</i> (1990) 19 NSWLR 91; <i>R&nbsp;v&nbsp;EJ Smith</i> [1982] 2 NSWLR 608 at&nbsp;615&#8211;616. The decision as to whether the Crown Prosecutor should exercise the right to make a closing
                        address is a question for the trial judge to make in the exercise of his or her discretion: <i>R&nbsp;v&nbsp;Zorad</i> at&nbsp;95.

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>Special procedures apply with respect to the cross-examination of certain witnesses by a self-represented accused. The relevant
               categories of witness are complainants in sexual offence proceedings: s&nbsp;294A <i>Criminal Procedure Act</i>; and vulnerable persons (whether or not the complainant) in criminal proceedings: s&nbsp;306ZL. If the accused is self-represented,
               any cross-examination must be conducted through a court-appointed intermediary.
            </p>
            <p>With respect to vulnerable persons, the court may choose not to appoint such a person if the court considers that it is not
               in the interests of justice to do so: s&nbsp;306ZL(5). There is no such discretion with respect to sexual offence complainants:
               s&nbsp;294A(5).
            </p>
            <p>The person appointed must ask the complainant or vulnerable person only those questions which the accused person requests
               that person to put to the complainant or vulnerable person: ss&nbsp;294A(3), 306ZL(3); and must not give legal or other advice
               to the accused: ss&nbsp;294A(4), 306ZL(4).
            </p>
            <p>The procedure applies whether or not closed-circuit television facilities are used to give evidence, or alternative arrangements
               have been made: ss&nbsp;294A(6), 306ZL(6).
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of the provisions is to spare the witness &#8220;the need to answer questions directly asked of him or her by the person
               said to have committed the offence&#8221;: <i>Clark&nbsp;v&nbsp;R</i> (2008) 185 A Crim R 1; [2008] NSWCCA 122. The legitimacy of such provisions with respect to sexual assault complainants was
               confirmed in <i>R&nbsp;v&nbsp;MSK&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;MAK</i> (2004) 61 NSWLR 204, where it was recognised at&nbsp;[69]:
            </p>
            <div class="blockquote">
               <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <p>&#8220;The use by [the self-represented accused] of the opportunity to confront and to challenge his alleged victim personally and
                     directly risks diverting the integrity of the judicial process, insofar as it is likely to intimidate the complainant to the
                     point where he or she is unable to give a coherent and rational account of what truthfully occurred. The threat of its occurrence
                     may also discourage a victim of sexual assault from giving evidence or even from making an initial complaint.&#8221;
                  </p>
               </blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>Special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused on 17&nbsp;February 2005: <i>R&nbsp;v&nbsp;MSK and MAK</i> [2005] HCA Trans&nbsp;22.
            </p>
            <p>Section 294A does not prescribe a procedure for the application of its provisions. In <i>Clark&nbsp;v&nbsp;R</i> it was held that it was appropriate for the judge to have appointed the registrar as the intermediary, and that there was
               nothing in the legislation to require the appointment of a legal practitioner: at&nbsp;[40], [43]&#8211;[44]. The appointed person should
               be present in court to hear the examination&nbsp;in&nbsp;chief of the complainant so as to ensure that the appointed person can carry
               out the cross-examination effectively and intelligently: at&nbsp;[45], [55].
            </p>
            <p>The judge erred in requiring the appellant to provide the judge with a list of questions proposed for cross-examination before
               the complainant&#8217;s examination&nbsp;in&nbsp;chief: at&nbsp;[46]. Such a requirement is &#8220;likely to give rise to the risk of a miscarriage of
               justice&#8221;: at&nbsp;[47], [55]. Furthermore, it may be impossible to meet as the questions asked in cross-examination may depend
               to a significant degree upon the witness&#8217;s responses to previous questions: at&nbsp;[48]. Such an approach may be justified where
               proposed questions deal with the matters proscribed by s&nbsp;293 <i>Criminal Procedure Act</i>: at&nbsp;[49]; but even in those circumstances disclosure before the complainant&#8217;s evidence&nbsp;in&nbsp;chief is finished is not justified:

                  <dd>
                     <p>At the earliest possible opportunity in proceedings, the court should inform the self-represented accused that if he or she
                        remains self-represented, he or she is prevented by law from personally questioning the complainant, and that the court must
                        appoint a person to ask the questions on behalf of the accused.

                  <dd>
                     <p>Once it is apparent that the trial will proceed with a self-represented accused, at the earliest opportunity the court should
                        appoint the person who will ask the accused&#8217;s questions of the complainant: s&nbsp;294A(2). In any event, the person should be
                        appointed in sufficient time to ensure that he or she can be present in court to hear the examination&nbsp;in&nbsp;chief of the complainant:
                        <i>Clark&nbsp;v&nbsp;R</i> (2008) 185 A&nbsp;Crim&nbsp;R&nbsp;1 at&nbsp;[45], [55].

                  <dd>
                     <p>The judge will explain to the intermediary his or her role, that is, that the intermediary is only to ask the questions sought
                        to be put by the accused: s&nbsp;294A(3).

                  <dd>
                     <p>The court should advise the accused to begin to prepare a list of questions sought to be asked of the complainant in cross-examination.
                        Consistent with the judge&#8217;s obligations with respect to a self-represented accused, the judge should explain the proposed
                        procedure for cross-examination of the complainant to the accused and advise the accused of the nature and form of questions
                        that are not permissible. For example, the trial judge should explain to the accused the type of questions that may be proscribed
                        by s&nbsp;293: <i>Clark&nbsp;v&nbsp;R</i> at&nbsp;[49].
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no requirement that the draft questions be made available to the Crown, although the Crown may be entitled to notice
                        of particular questions, for example, for the purposes of ascertaining admissibility under s&nbsp;293: <i>Clark&nbsp;v&nbsp;R</i> at&nbsp;[54].
                     </p>
                     <p>Similarly, there is no requirement for all of the draft questions to be submitted to the court for approval in advance as:</p>

                           <p>&#8220;&#8230; any question to be asked of a witness in cross-examination may ride upon the answer just given. The requirement to frame
                              all questions in advance may impart a rigidity which robs a cross-examination of its effectiveness&#8221;: <i>Clark&nbsp;v&nbsp;R</i> at&nbsp;[48].

                     <p>However, the trial judge may require the accused to formulate proposed questions which might infringe the requirements of
                        s&nbsp;293, and inform the court in advance of any such questions: <i>Clark&nbsp;v&nbsp;R</i> at&nbsp;[49].

                     <p>If the accused is not literate, the court-appointed intermediary &#8212; or, if necessary, an interpreter &#8212; could write out the

            <p>Section 293(4) <i>Criminal Procedure Act</i> sets out the limited circumstances in which a complainant can be cross-examined about her or his sexual experience. Section&nbsp;293(8)
               provides the court must, <i>before</i> the evidence is given, provide reasons as to why the evidence falls within one of the exceptions in s&nbsp;293(4) and the nature
               and scope of the evidence. Where an accused is self-represented &#8220;the trial judge needs to take special care to see that the
               requirements of the section are respected&#8221;: <i>Clark v R</i> at [49]. The judge should explain to an accused person the nature of the questions proscribed by s&nbsp;293 and require the accused
               to formulate any proposed questions in advance: <i>Clark v R</i> at&nbsp;[49]. See further discussion of s&nbsp;293 at [<a href="cross-examination.html#p1-342">1-342</a>].

                  the Crown Prosecutor has finished asking [<i>his/her</i>] questions. I will appoint a person, who I will refer to as an intermediary, to ask the complainant questions in cross-examination
                  for you. The intermediary will be present at the time the complainant gives [<i>his/her</i>] evidence&nbsp;in&nbsp;chief.
               </p>
               <p>You need to prepare a list of the questions you want the intermediary to ask the complainant and I suggest that you start
                  preparing those questions now, if you have not already done so. The intermediary is only here to help you by asking the complainant
                  the questions you have prepared. [<i>He/she</i>] cannot give you legal advice. However, the intermediary can put into other words the questions you have prepared. Before
                  the intermediary cross-examines the complainant I will give you the opportunity to review the questions you propose to have&nbsp;asked.
               </p>
               <p>The Crown Prosecutor will not see the questions before they are asked, but if [<i>he/she</i>] objects to any of the questions when the intermediary asks the complainant, then I will deal with that objection in the
                  usual&nbsp;way.
               </p>
               <p>During the cross-examination of the complainant, if you need more time to prepare additional questions, or reconsider the
                  wording of some of your questions because of rulings I have made as a result of objections or the admissibility of a particular
                  question, then I will give you some time to do&nbsp;so.

               <p>When the cross-examination is finished, and before I give the Crown Prosecutor the opportunity to re-examine the complainant,

                  time to prepare additional questions, I will give you some time to do&nbsp;so.

            <p class="kern1">Part 1AD <i>Crimes Act 1914</i> (Cth) also places constraints on the cross-examination of certain witnesses by a self-represented accused. That Part applies
               to various offences, including child sex tourism, slavery, sexual servitude and human trafficking: s&nbsp;15Y(1). Under s&nbsp;15YF,
               a self-represented accused is prohibited from cross-examining a vulnerable person, and a person appointed by the court is
               to ask him or her any questions sought to be put by the accused. A self-represented accused must not cross-examine a vulnerable
               person unless the court grants leave: s&nbsp;15YG(1). Section&nbsp;15YG(1A) defines a vulnerable person to include a child witness (other
               than a child complainant) for a child proceeding (as defined in s&nbsp;15YA). The court must not grant leave &#8220;unless satisfied
               that the vulnerable person&#8217;s ability to testify under cross-examination will not be adversely affected&#8221;: s&nbsp;15YG(2). In applying
               this test, the court is to consider &#8220;any trauma that could be caused if the defendant conducts the cross-examination&#8221;: s&nbsp;15YG(3).
               The Commonwealth legislation does not specifically require a warning in the terms of ss&nbsp;294A(7) or 306ZI(4) <i>Criminal Procedure Act</i>, although it may be prudent to give a warning in such terms for these matters.

                    <p align="left">In a chapter on &quot;The Role of National 
                      Courts in the International Legal Process&quot; in <i> Problems 
                      and Process - International Law and How We Use It <a name="FOOTBODY_3"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_3">3</a></sup> </i> Judge Rosalyn 
                      Higgins of the International Court of Justice explains the 
                      need for a good grounding in both municipal and international 
                      law if there is ever to be a real understanding of the relationship 
                      between the two. But suddenly, things are happening. 
                    <p align="left"> Different theories about the relationship 
                      of domestic and international law compete for acceptance. 
                      Monists assert that there is but one system of law, with 
                      international law as an element &quot;alongside all the 
                      various branches of domestic law&quot; <a name="FOOTBODY_4"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_4">4</a></sup> . For the monist, 
                      international law is simply part of the law of the land, 
                      together with the more familiar areas of national law. Dualists, 
                      on the other hand, assert that there are two essentially 
                      different legal systems. They exist &quot;side by side within 
                      different spheres of action - the international plane and 
                      the domestic plane&quot;. 
                    <p align="left"> A culture of monism or dualism is inherited 
                      from our place of birth or adoption. I was raised in the 
                      dualist school. Whilst international law was a subject taught 
                      at university, and was regarded as true law, it was on a 
                      different plane. It addressed itself to States and international 
                      organisations and their concerns. Rarely did it impinge 
                      upon domestic law, doubtless because of the dualist theory 
                      and the discouraging attitude of the legal profession. The 
                      negative response was nurtured in the soil of dualism. 
                    <p align="left"> Thanks in large part to a remarkable series 
                      of judicial colloquia organised by the Commonwealth Secretariat 
                      in London - with the assistance of Interights - the culture 
                      of resistance, or indifference, to international law is 
                      changing. If one asks for the vision of the legal order 
                      in the twenty-first century, an aspect of great relevance 
                      is the growing rapprochement which can be detected between 
                      international and domestic law. This is happening as a natural 
                      and inevitable result of the increasing influence of international 
                      law upon the municipal legal system, including the influence 
                      of the international law of human rights. 
                    <p align="left"> The High Court of Australia, on which I serve, 
                      has long paid great respect to the opinions of the International 
                      Court of Justice as expositions of the principles of international 
                      law where those principles have arisen for consideration 
                      in Australian cases. Sir Gerard Brennan, the former Chief 
                      Justice of Australia, recently collected some of the cases 
                      and referred to their use <a name="FOOTBODY_5"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_5">5</a></sup> 
                      . Chief Justice Brennan cited, with apparent approval, the 
                      remark of his predecessor, Sir Anthony Mason, describing 
                      the gradual erosion, in Australia, of the strict theory 
                      of dualism. Sir Anthony had suggested that it was &quot;an 
                      overhang of the old culture in which international affairs 
                      and national affairs were regarded as disparate and separate 
                      elements&quot;. He foresaw that culture giving way to &quot;the 
                      realisation that there is an ongoing interaction between 
                      international and national affairs, including law&quot; 
                      <a name="FOOTBODY_6"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_6">6</a></sup> 
                      . 
                    <p align="left"> In <i> Mabo v State of Queensland [No 2]</i> 
                      <a name="FOOTBODY_7"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_7">7</a></sup> 
                      , as a step in his reasoning towards the conclusion that 
                      the &quot;native title&quot; to land of Australia's indigenous 
                      peoples had survived the acquisition of sovereignty over 
                      the continent by the British Crown and its settlement by 
                      the European colonists, Justice Brennan said of the influence 
                      of international human rights law: 
                    <p align="left"> &quot;Whatever the justification advanced 
                      in earlier days for refusing to recognise the rights and 
                      interests in land of the indigenous inhabitants of settled 
                      colonies, an unjust and indiscriminatory document of that 
                      kind can no longer be accepted. The expectations of the 
                      international community accord in this respect with the 
                      contemporary values of the Australian people. The opening 
                      up of international remedies to individuals pursuant to 
                      Australia's accession to the Optional Protocol to the <i> 
                      International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</i> 
                      <a name="FOOTBODY_8"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_8">8</a></sup> 
                      brings to bear on the common law the powerful influence 
                      of the Covenant and the international standards it imports. 
                      The common law does not necessarily conform with international 
                      law, but international law is a legitimate and important 
                      influence on the development of the common law, especially 
                      when international law declares the existence of universal 
                      human rights. A common law doctrine founded on unjust discrimination 
                      in the enjoyment of civil and political rights demands reconsideration. 
                      It is contrary both to international standards and to the 
                      fundamental values of our common law to entrench a discriminatory 
                      rule which, because of the supposed position on the scale 
                      of social organisation of the indigenous inhabitants of 
                      a settled colony, denies them a right to occupy their traditional 
                      land&quot;. 
                    <p align="left"> In Australia, New Zealand, Britain and other 
                      countries of the common law which, until now, have adhered 
                      scrupulously to dualism, a change is gradually coming about. 
                      It is the impact of universal notions expressed in international 
                      law, as they affect municipal law that I wish to explore 
                      in this essay. This is one of the most interesting developments 
                      occurring in the domestic law of many countries at this 
                      time. The development has its critics as well as its supporters. 
                      I will describe the developments in some of the jurisdictions 
                      which I know best. I will then attempt to draw some general 
                      conclusions. 
                    <p align="left"> THE BANGALORE PRINCIPLES 
                    <p align="left"> The traditional view of most common law countries 
                      has been the dualist one described by Rossalyn Higgins: 
                      that international law is not part of domestic law. Blackstone 
                      in his <i> Commentaries </i> , suggested that: 
                    <p align="left"> &quot;... the law of nations (whenever any 
                      question arises which is properly the object of its jurisdiction) 
                      is here [in England] adopted in its full extent by the common 
                      law, and is held to be part of the law of the land ...&quot;

                      Blackstone had a more lasting influence, his view came to 
                      be regarded, virtually universally in common law legal systems, 
                      as being &quot;without foundation&quot; <a name="FOOTBODY_10"></a>

                    <p align="left"> A new recognition has now come about concerning 
                      the use which may be made by judges of international human 
                      rights principles and of their exposition by the international 
                      courts, tribunals and other bodies established to give them 
                      content and effect. This has happened as a reflection of 
                      the growing body of international human rights law, of the 
                      instruments both regional and international which give effect 
                      to it, and as a result of the recognition of the importance 
                      of its content for people everywhere. 
                    <p align="left"> An expression of the new approach was given 
                      in February 1988 in Bangalore, India in the so-called <i> 
                      Bangalore Principles </i> . These were agreed by a group 
                      of lawyers, mainly from Commonwealth countries, in the first 
                      in the series of colloquia to which I have referred. The 
                      meeting in Bangalore was chaired by Justice P N. Bhagwati, 
                      former Chief Justice of India. I was the sole participant 
                      from Australasia. Amongst the other participants were Mr 
                      Anthony Lester QC (now Lord Lester of Herne Hill), Justice 
                      Rajsoomer Lallah (later Chief Justice of Mauritius) and 
                      Justice Enoch Dumbutshena (then Chief Justice of Zimbabwe). 
                      Joining the Commonwealth participants was a judge of the 
                      Federal Circuit Court in the United States, Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
                      (now a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States). 
                    <p align="left"> Relevantly, the <i> Bangalore Principles 
                      </i> state, in effect: 
                    <p align="left"> (1) International law (whether human rights 
                      norms or otherwise) is not, as such, part of domestic law 
                      in most common law countries; 
                    <p align="left"> (2) Such law does not become part of domestic 
                      law until Parliament so enacts or the judges (as another 
                      source of law-making) declare now the norms thereby established 
                      are part of domestic law; 
                    <p align="left"> (3) The judges will not do so automatically, 
                      simply because the norm is part of international law or 
                      is mentioned in a treaty - even one ratified by their own 
                      country; 
                    <p align="left"> (4) But if an issue of uncertainty arises 
                      (as by a <i> lacuna </i> in the common law, obscurity in 
                      its meaning or ambiguity in a relevant statute), a judge 
                      may seek guidance in the general principles of international 
                      law, as accepted by the community of nations; and 
                    <p align="left"> (5) From this source material, the judge 
                      may ascertain and declare what the relevant rule of domestic 
                      law is. It is the action of the judge, incorporating the 
                      rule into domestic law, which then makes it part of domestic 
                      law <a name="FOOTBODY_12"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_12">12</a></sup>

                      courts to have regard to these international norms for the 
                      purpose of deciding cases where the domestic law - whether 
                      constitutional, statute or common law - is uncertain or 
                      incomplete. It is within the proper nature of the judicial 
                      process and well-established judicial functions for national 
                      courts to have regard to international obligations which 
                      a country undertakes - whether or not they have been incorporated 
                      into domestic law - for the purpose of removing ambiguity

                    <p align="left"> Some Australian lawyers (and not a few judges), 
                      brought up in the tradition of the strict dualism were inclined, 
                      at first, to regard the <i> Bangalore Principles </i> as 
                      completely heretical <a name="FOOTBODY_15"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_15">15</a></sup> 
                      . They cling to such decisions as <i> R v Secretary of State

                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_16">16</a></sup> and regard with 
                      much scepticism the assistance to be derived from an international 
                      treaty, other international law or the pronouncements of 
                      international or regional courts, tribunals and committees. 
                      In doing so they observe the classical response of the dualists. 
                      But their views will not prevail. 
                    <p align="left"> HIGH JUDICIAL PRONOUNCEMENTS 
                    <p align="left"> In the ten years since the <i> Bangalore 
                      Principles </i> were formulated, something of a sea change 
                      has come over the approach of courts in England, Australia, 
                      New Zealand and other countries of the common law. The clearest 
                      indication of the change in Australia can be found in the 
                      remarks of Justice Brennan (with the concurrence of Chief 
                      Justice Mason and Justice McHugh) in <i> Mabo v Queensland 
                      [No. 2]</i> <a name="FOOTBODY_17"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_17">17</a></sup>

                      . 
                    <p align="left"> To similar effect were the observations of 
                      the English Court of Appeal in <i> Derbyshire County Council 
                      v Times Newspapers Limited</i> <a name="FOOTBODY_19"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_19">19</a></sup> , a decision later 
                      affirmed by the House of Lords, although with somewhat different 
                      reasoning <a name="FOOTBODY_20"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_20">20</a></sup> 
                      . In a sense, the Court of Appeal decision paved the way 
                      for the reasoning of Justice Brennan in <i> Mabo </i> and 
                      was referred to by him. The question in <i> Derbyshire </i> 
                      concerned the question whether a local government authority 
                      was entitled, by the law of England, to sue for libel to 
                      protect its corporate reputation (as distinct from that 
                      of its members). The trial judge (Justice Morland) had held 
                      that it was <a name="FOOTBODY_21"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_21">21</a></sup> 
                      . His decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal. In the 
                      course of his reasoning, Lord Justice Balcombe <a name="FOOTBODY_22"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_22">22</a></sup> referred to article 
                      10 of the <i> European Convention on Human Rights </i> to 
                      which the United Kingdom is a party. That article relates 
                      to freedom of expression. His Lordship said: 
                    <p align="left"> &quot;In my judgment ... where the law is 
                      uncertain, it must be right for the court to approach the 
                      issue before it with a predilection to ensure that our law 
                      should not involve a breach of article 10. That was the 
                      approach of Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in <i> In re K D (a 
                      Minor) (Ward: Termination of Access) [1988] AC 806 </i>where, 
                      in relation to an argument based on articles 6 and 8 of 
                      the same Convention and a previous decision of the European 
                      Court of Human Rights, ... he cited with approval the argument 
                      of counsel in the following passage at p 823: 'Although 
                      this is not binding upon your Lordships, the United Kingdom 
                      is, of course, a party to the Convention for the Protection 
                      of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and it is urged 
                      that it is at least desirable that the domestic law of the 
                      United Kingdom should accord with the decisions of the European 
                      Court of Human Rights under the Convention'&quot;.

                      Justice Gleeson and myself; Justice Mahoney dissenting) 
                      followed <i> Derbyshire </i> and the earlier similar judgment 
                      of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South 
                      Africa in <i> Die Spoorbond v South African Railways</i>

                      referred to the provisions of article 19.2 of the <i> International 
                      Covenant on Civil and Political Rights </i> which Australia 
                      had ratified. Following, as it did, the decision of the 
                      High Court of Australia in <i> Mabo </i> , nobody questioned 
                      the relevance of a consideration by the Court of applicable 
                      or relevant international human rights principles in assisting 
                      it to come to its conclusions about the content of Australian 
                      common law. 
                    <p align="left"> In New Zealand, a similar trend has also 
                      emerged. In that country, the position is somewhat different 
                      from that of Australia and England, by reason of the enactment 
                      of the <i> New Zealand Bill of Rights Act </i> 1990 <a name="FOOTBODY_28"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_28">28</a></sup> . In <i> Ministry

                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_29">29</a></sup> , the New Zealand 
                      Court of Appeal was required to consider whether the provisions 
                      of the <i> Transport Act </i> 1962 (NZ), ss 58B, 58C and 
                      58D, relating to breath and blood testing were inconsistent 
                      with the right to legal advice under the <i> New Zealand 
                      Bill of Rights Act </i> . The Court, by majority (Justice 
                      Cooke, President; Justices Richardson, Hardie-Boys and McKay; 
                      Justice Gault dissenting) dismissed the appeal, holding 
                      that there was no relevant inconsistency. The reasoning 
                      of the judges differed. Justice Cooke (as Lord Cooke of 
                      Thorndon then was) referred to the &quot;cardinal importance&quot;, 
                      in giving meaning to the <i> New Zealand Bill of Rights 
                      Act </i> to &quot;bear in mind the antecedents&quot;: 
                    <p align="left"> &quot;The International Covenant on Civil 
                      and Political Rights speaks of inalienable rights derived 
                      from the inherent dignity of the human person. Internationally 
                      there is now general recognition that some human rights 
                      are fundamental and anterior to any municipal law, although 
                      municipal law may fall short of giving effect to them: see 
                      <i> Mabo v Queensland </i> (1988) 166 CLR 186, 217-218. 
                      The right to legal advice on arrest or detention under an 
                      enactment may not be quite in that class, but in any event 
                      it has become a widely-recognised right ... Subject to contrary 
                      requirements in any legislation, the New Zealand Courts 
                      must now, in my opinion, give it practical effect irrespective

                    <p align="left"> The extent of a possible obligation on the 
                      part of New Zealand Ministers to have regard to international 
                      human rights norms was again considered by the New Zealand 
                      Court of Appeal in <i> Tavita v Minister of Immigration</i> 
                      <a name="FOOTBODY_31"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_31">31</a></sup>. 
                      That case involved the consideration of the relevance of 
                      international norms to administrative decision-making, as 
                      distinct from the interpretation and application of the 
                      Bill of Rights Act. Mr Tavita had overstayed his permit 
                      to be in New Zealand. He applied to the Court to set aside 
                      a removal order. He argued that the Minister, and the Immigration 
                      Service had failed, although obliged by law, to have regard 
                      to the international obligations relating to a child born 
                      to the applicant and his family in New Zealand. He was thus 
                      entitled to stay in New Zealand. The Crown argued that the 
                      Minister and the Department were entitled to ignore international 
                      obligations whether of the <i> International Covenant on 
                      Civil and Political Rights </i> , the <i> First Optional 
                      Protocol </i> or the <i> Convention on the Rights of the 
                      Child </i> 1989, all ratified by New Zealand. 
                    <p align="left"> Delivering the interim judgment of the New 
                      Zealand Court of Appeal, Justice Cooke stopped short of 
                      deciding that international obligations <i> must </i> be 
                      considered in the performance of the administrative decision-making 
                      process <a name="FOOTBODY_32"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_32">32</a></sup> 
                      . Nevertheless, he reviewed the relevant jurisprudence under 
                      the <i> European Convention </i> established by decisions 
                      of the European Court of Human Rights <a name="FOOTBODY_33"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_33">33</a></sup> . He went on to 
                      describe the Minister's submission as: 
                    <p align="left"> &quot;... an unattractive argument, apparently 
                      implying that New Zealand's adherence to the international 
                      instruments has been at least partly window-dressing. Although, 
                      for the reasons to be mentioned shortly, a final decision 
                      on the argument is neither necessary nor desirable, there 
                      must at least be hesitation about accepting it. The law 
                      as to the bearing on domestic law of international human 
                      rights and instruments declaring them is undergoing evolution. 
                      For the appellant [counsel] drew our attention to the Balliol 
                      Statement of 1992, the full text of which appears in 67 
                      ALJ 67, with its reference to the duty of the judiciary 
                      to interpret and apply national constitutions, ordinary 
                      legislation and the common law in the light of the universality 
                      of human rights. It has since been reaffirmed in the Bloemfontein 
                      Statement of 1993.&quot; 
                    <p align="left"> If and when the matter does fall for decision, 
                      an aspect to be borne in mind may be one urged by counsel 
                      for the appellant: that since New Zealand's accession to 
                      the Optional Protocol the United Nations Human Rights Committee 
                      is in a sense part of the country's judicial structure, 
                      in that individuals subject to New Zealand jurisdiction 
                      have direct rights of recourse to it. A failure to give 
                      practical effect to international instruments to which New 
                      Zealand is a party may attract criticism. Legitimate criticism 
                      could extend to the New Zealand Courts if they were to accept 
                      the argument that, because a domestic statute giving discretionary 
                      powers in general terms does not mention international human 
                      rights norms or obligations, the executive is necessarily 
                      free to ignore them <a name="FOOTBODY_34"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_34">34</a></sup>

                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_46">46</a></sup> . In many of the 
                      lastmentioned decisions, a feature of the reasoning is the 
                      reference by the judges, not only to the text of a relevant 
                      international instrument, but also to the development of 
                      the jurisprudence by courts, tribunals and committees - 
                      particularly the European Court of Human Rights - which 
                      elaborate and explain the fundamental norms. 
                    <p align="left"> In New Zealand, the vehicle of the <i> New 
                      Zealand Bill of Rights Act </i> , although not constitutionally 
                      entrenched, gives an established framework for the reference 
                      to analogous jurisprudence developed around similarly expressed 
                      provisions in international law. The same is true of India 
                      Sri Lanka and countries of the &quot;new Commonwealth&quot; 
                      which have written constitutions incorporating a detailed 
                      Bill of Rights. In Australia and England there is no similar 
                      charter of enforceable rights although a Bill has been introduced 
                      into the United Kingdom Parliament to incorporate the European 
                      convention into domestic law. Meanwhile, the absence of 
                      a constitutional charter has not stopped the courts, in 
                      the manner suggested in the <i> Bangalore Principles </i> 
                      , from utilising international law where a relevant gap 
                      appears in the common law where a statute falls to be construed 
                      which is ambiguous. 
                    <p align="left"> A CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETIVE PRINCIPLE 
                    <p align="left"> There is one further development which should 
                      be mentioned. It represents a further step in the logic 
                      of the <i> Bangalore Principles </i> and one to which I 
                      have recently given expression. It involves the adoption 
                      of an &quot;interpretative principle&quot; for the construction 
                      of constitutional texts, so that the text is construed, 
                      as far as possible, to resolve any ambiguities that may 
                      exist, in favour of a construction which upholds universal 
                      human rights in preference to one which does not. 
                    <p align="left"> Consider the two Australian cases in which 
                      this &quot;interpretative principle&quot; has been stated. 
                      The first, <i> Newcrest Mining (WA) Ltd v The Commonwealth</i> 
                      <a name="FOOTBODY_47"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_47">47</a></sup> 
                      , concerned a longstanding controversy about the interpretation 
                      of two sections of the Australian Constitution. One section, 
                      s 51(xxxi) limits the power of the Australian Federal Parliament 
                      to make laws providing for compulsory acquisition of property 
                      otherwise than on just terms. In that sense it reflected 
                      the commitment to lawfulness, due process and fair compensation 
                      expressed in international law including in the <i> Universal 
                      Declaration of Human Rights </i> Art 17.2 <a name="FOOTBODY_48"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_48">48</a></sup> . The other (s 
                      122) affords the Federal Parliament plenary power to make 
                      laws for the government of the Australian territories. The 
                      question was whether the restriction in the list of federal 
                      powers carried over to control laws made for the Northern 
                      Territory which had the effect of the compulsory acquisition 
                      of property. Were such laws in the territories exempt from 
                      the federal requirements? 
                    <p align="left"> A previous decision of the High Court of 
                      Australia had held that they were exempt <a name="FOOTBODY_49"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_49">49</a></sup> . That decision 
                      was challenged. The Court divided in its opinions. The constitutional 
                      text appeared to be ambiguous. In reaching my conclusion 
                      that the territories power was to be read as subject to 
                      the requirements governing compulsory acquisitions, I invoked 
                      an &quot;interpretative principle&quot; whose provenance 
                      may be traced to Bangalore <a name="FOOTBODY_50"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_50">50</a></sup> 
                      : 
                    <p align="left"> &quot;Where the Constitution is ambiguous, 
                      this Court should adopt that meaning which conforms to the 
                      principles of fundamental rights rather than an interpretation 
                      which would involve a departure from such rights. Australian 
                      law, including its constitutional law, may sometimes fall 
                      short of giving effect to fundamental rights. The duty of 
                      the Court is to interpret what the Constitution says and 
                      not what individual judges may think it should have said. 
                      If the Constitution is clear, the Court must ... give effect 
                      to its terms. Nor should the Court adopt an interpretative 
                      principle as a means of introducing, by the back door, provisions 
                      in international treaties or other international law concerning 
                      fundamental rights not yet incorporated into Australian 
                      domestic law. However, ... the inter-relationship of national 
                      and international law, including in relation to fundamental 
                      rights, is 'undergoing evolution'. ... [I]nternational law 
                      is a legitimate and important influence on the development 
                      of the common law and constitutional law, especially when 
                      international law declares the existence of universal and 
                      fundamental rights. To the full extent that its text permits, 
                      Australia's Constitution, as the fundamental law of government 
                      in this country, accommodates itself to international law, 
                      including in so far as that law expresses basic rights&quot;. 
                    <p align="left"> No other Justice of the Australian High Court 
                      in <i> Newcrest </i> embraced this principle. However, in 
                      a recent comment, Sir Anthony Mason has remarked that the 
                      approach adopted by me &quot;is entirely consistent with 
                      the principles of statutory construction adopted in <i> 
                      Coco v The Queen</i> <a name="FOOTBODY_51"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_51">51</a></sup> 
                      and it shares something in common with the use of international 
                      law and conventions as a source for development of the common 
                      law, as expounded by [Justice] Brennan in <i> Mabo [No 2]</i> 
                      <a name="FOOTBODY_52"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_52">52</a></sup> 
                      and subsequently by other Justices in <i> Dietrich v The 
                      Queen</i> <a name="FOOTBODY_53"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_53">53</a></sup>

                      &quot;. Sir Anthony added some cautionary remarks: &quot;Whether 
                      this approach will be adopted and, if so, whether it will 
                      make a significant difference remains to be seen. If the 
                      approach is adopted, the question in each case is essentially 
                      particular: Is there any ambiguity? And, if the ambiguity 
                      can be resolved by recourse to history, tradition and Convention 
                      Debates, are they to be over-ridden by the presumptive rule 
                      of construction?&quot; 
                    <p align="left"> A more recent decision on this point concerned 
                      the meaning of s 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution 
                      (&quot;the race power&quot;). That provision permits the 
                      Australian Federal Parliament to make special laws with 
                      respect to the people of any race. In my reasons I returned 
                      to the &quot;interpretative principle&quot; <a name="FOOTBODY_55"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_55">55</a></sup> . In rejecting 
                      the argument that such &quot;special laws&quot; could be 
                      adverse and detrimental to persons on the ground of their 
                      race, I said <a name="FOOTBODY_56"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_56">56</a></sup> 
                      : 
                    <p align="left"> &quot;[T]he Australian Constitution, which 
                      is a special statute, does not operate in a vacuum. It speaks 
                      to the people of Australia. But it also speaks to the international 
                      community as the basic law of the Australian nation which 
                      is a member of that community. If there is one subject upon 
                      which the international law of fundamental rights resonates 
                      with a single voice it is the prohibition of detrimental 
                      distinctions on the basis of race. I consider that Judge 
                      Tanaka was correct in the International Court of Justice, 
                      when he declared that <a name="FOOTBODY_57"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_57">57</a></sup> 
                      : 
                    <p align="left"> '[T]he norm of non-discrimination or non-separation 
                      on the basis of race has become a rule of customary international 
                      law' <a name="FOOTBODY_58"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_58">58</a></sup> 
                      .&quot; 
                    <p align="left"> Where, unlike in Australia, a constitutional 
                      text exists which contains a comprehensive statement of 
                      fundamental rights, the path of judicial construction, conformable 
                      to the interpretative principle which I have propounded, 
                      is much simpler. Where such a constitutional text makes 
                      reference to fundamental human rights, as also recognised 
                      in international law, it is highly desirable, indeed obligatory, 
                      for judges within municipal systems to familiarise themselves 
                      with the international jurisprudence collecting around the 
                      same words in international and regional bodies devoted 
                      to expounding their meaning. 
                    <p align="left"> Although the &quot;interpretative principle&quot; 
                      to which I have referred probably represents, at this time, 
                      a minority opinion in Australia, it seems likely to me that 
                      it will ultimately be accepted as the rapprochement between 
                      international law (including that of human rights) and domestic 
                      law gathers pace in the coming millennium <a name="FOOTBODY_59"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_59">59</a></sup> . But, in considering 
                      this possibility, it is necessary to acknowledge the views 
                      of critics who approach the <i> Bangalore Principles </i> 
                      with suspicion and caution. 
                    <p align="left"> CAUTIONARY WORDS 
                    <p align="left"> Critics of the developments which I have 
                      outlined list a number of considerations which need to be 
                      taken into account as the judges of national legal systems 
                      venture upon this new source of law-making. The expressed 
                      concerns usually include: 
                    <p align="left"> (1) Treaties are typically negotiated by 
                      the Executive Government, as the modern manifestation of 
                      the Crown. They may or may not reflect the will of the people, 
                      expressed by their representatives in Parliament; 
                    <p align="left"> (2) The processes of ratification are often 
                      imperfect. In Australia, for example, the Federal Government 
                      deposited the instrument of accession to the first <i> Optional 
                      Protocol </i> to the <i> ICCPR </i> before tabling the instrument 
                      in Parliament. This was described by one observer as &quot;extraordinary 
                      ... without any public debate or even public awareness of 
                      its existence, let alone its scope and significance&quot; 
                      <a name="FOOTBODY_60"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_60">60</a></sup> 
                      . There is now, in Australia, a lively discussion of the 
                      need to improve the procedures for the ratification of international 
                      treaties and to provide for pre-ratification scrutiny by 
                      the Federal Parliament <a name="FOOTBODY_61"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_61">61</a></sup> 
                      ; 
                    <p align="left"> (3) In federal countries special concern 
                      has been expressed that the ratification of international 
                      treaties may be used as a means to undermine the distribution 
                      of powers between the Federal and State legislatures in 
                      a way never contemplated by the drafters of the Constitution 
                      <a name="FOOTBODY_62"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_62">62</a></sup> 
                      . One reason commonly advanced for awaiting legislation 
                      to introduce an aspect of international law into domestic 
                      law in a federation, is that such a course will permit the 
                      constitutional validity of the statutory introduction of 
                      the norm to be tested in the courts; 
                    <p align="left"> (4) Then it is suggested that judicial introduction 
                      of human rights norms may divert the community from the 
                      more open, principled and democratic adoption of such norms 
                      in constitutional or statutory amendments which have the 
                      legitimacy of popular endorsement. The recent exposition 
                      by the High Court of Australia of fundamental rights to 
                      be implied from the nature and purposes of the Australian 
                      <i> Constitution </i> has sometimes been criticised on this 
                      ground <a name="FOOTBODY_63"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_63">63</a></sup> 
                      . Those who hold to this view urge that it would be preferable 
                      to engage in a candid national debate and to accept openly 
                      an enacted Bill of Rights rather than to accept such a development 
                      from the judiciary; 
                    <p align="left"> (5) Some commentators have also expressed 
                      scepticism about the international courts, tribunals and 
                      committees which pronounce upon human rights. They assert 
                      that they are typically made up of persons from legal regimes 
                      quite different from our own. In <i> R v Jefferies</i> <a name="FOOTBODY_64"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_64">64</a></sup> Justice Richardson, 
                      now President of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, observed 
                      that, whilst the jurisprudence of Canada in the area of 
                      human rights and that of the European Court of Human Rights 
                      have offered undoubted assistance in the interpretation 
                      and application of the <i> New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 
                      </i> , New Zealand should nonetheless be wary. It should 
                      not forget its own legal and social history which has disdained 
                      federation and, so far, has declined to accept an entrenched 
                      statement of rights with overriding constitutional force; 
                    <p align="left"> (6) To similar effect, critics have pointed 
                      to the generality of the expression of many of the provisions 
                      contained in international human rights instruments. Of 
                      necessity, these are stated in language lacking in precision. 
                      This means that those who use them may be tempted to read 
                      into the broad language what they hope, expect or want to 
                      see. Whilst the judge of the common law tradition has an 
                      indisputable creative role, such creativity must be restrained. 
                      It must proceed in a judicial way. It must not undermine 
                      the primacy of democratic law-making by the organs of government, 
                      directly or indirectly accountable to the people <a name="FOOTBODY_65"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_65">65</a></sup> ; and 
                    <p align="left"> (7) Finally, the world, in the matter of 
                      rights protection, is by no means monochrome. We are now 
                      at pains to protect the bio-diversity of fauna and flora. 
                      The principle of self-determination of peoples is a reflection 
                      of the fundamental right of every people to be governed 
                      in a way acceptable to a majority of the population. It 
                      would be ironic if the advance of international human rights 
                      principles were to undermine the variety of human legal 
                      systems and democratic accountability which is itself an 
                      important right which courts should loyally respect <a name="FOOTBODY_66"></a>

                    <p align="left"> SUPPORT FOR THE BANGALORE PRINCIPLES 
                    <p align="left"> As against the foregoing criticisms and cautionary 
                      words, the supporters of the <i> Bangalore Principles </i> 
                      point to a number of factors which must be kept in mind 
                      in evaluating the evolving jurisprudence: 
                    <p align="left"> (1) The <i> Bangalore Principles </i> do 
                      not undermine the sovereignty of national law-making institutions. 
                      They acknowledge that if those institutions have made (by 
                      constitutional, statutory or common law decision) a rule 
                      which is unambiguous and binding, no international human 
                      rights principle can undermine or overrule the applicable 
                      domestic law. To introduce such a principle requires the 
                      existence of a gap in the common law or ambiguity in a local 
                      statute. Then, by direct legislation or indirect introduction 
                      by the judicial branch of government, the principle can 
                      be imported into the law of the sovereign country. Far from 
                      being a negation of sovereignty, this is an application 
                      of it; 
                    <p align="left"> (2) The process which the <i> Bangalore Principles 
                      </i> endorse is, in a sense, as Justice Brennan described 
                      it in <i> Mabo </i> , an inevitable one. As countries, such 
                      as New Zealand and Australia, by subscription to the <i> 
                      First Optional Protocol </i> , submit themselves to the 
                      external scrutiny and criticism of their laws by the United 
                      Nations Human Rights Committee, the results must be addressed. 
                      If a domestic law is measured and found wanting, a country 
                      must bring its law into conformity or be revealed engaged 
                      in human rights &quot;window-dressing&quot;; 
                    <p align="left"> (3) Modern notions of democracy are more 
                      complex than formerly was the case. They involve more than 
                      the reflection in law-making by the will of the majority, 
                      intermittently expressed upon a broad range of issues at 
                      general elections. Now, it is increasingly appreciated that 
                      the legitimacy of democratic governance depends upon the 
                      respect by the majority for the fundamental rights of minorities 
                      <a name="FOOTBODY_67"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_67">67</a></sup> 
                      . Therefore, in so far as courts give effect at least to 
                      fundamental rights, they are assisting in the discharge 
                      of their governmental functions to advance the complex notion 
                      of democracy as it is now understood; 
                    <p align="left"> (4) So far as federal states are concerned, 
                      their constitutions do not stand still. The view has been 
                      expressed that a federal parliament and government is a 
                      trustee for the international standards of the world community 
                      in which it is the responsibility of the federal polity 
                      to be the nation's voice <a name="FOOTBODY_68"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_68">68</a></sup> 
                      . The power of a constitutional court to strike down excessive 
                      laws and to measure all laws against the standards of the 
                      <i> Constitution </i> as understood from time to time, ensure 
                      that such laws meet the requirements of constitutionality. 
                      But federal constitutions must themselves adapt to the world 
                      in which the federal state now finds itself. This, indisputably, 
                      is a world of increasing interrelationships in matters of 
                      security, economics and of human rights. Judges, like legislatures 
                      and governments, cannot ignore the international reality 
                      within which their legal systems now operate; 
                    <p align="left"> (5) Giving effect to international law where 
                      a country has formally ratified a relevant treaty, does 
                      no more than give substance to the act which the executive 
                      government has taken. The knowledge that the judicial use 
                      of international law in this way is now becoming more frequent 
                      may have the beneficial consequence of discouraging ratification 
                      where there is no serious intention to accept a prospect 
                      of incorporation of the principles contained in the treaty; 
                    <p align="left"> (6) The international impact upon local law 
                      is already occurring outside the judiciary. For example, 
                      international human rights principles are being introduced 
                      into domestic law by express legislation <a name="FOOTBODY_69"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_69">69</a></sup> . Sometimes that 
                      legislation follows determinations of a relevant international 
                      body, as was the case of the recent Australian statute: 
                      <i> Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act </i> 1994 (Cth). That 
                      Act followed the decision of the United Nations Human Rights 
                      Committee in determining a complaint by Mr Nicholas Toonen 
                      against Australia in respect of the Tasmanian laws on homosexual 
                      offences. Similar laws had been repealed everywhere else 
                      in Australia <a name="FOOTBODY_70"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_70">70</a></sup> 
                      . Given that other branches of government are giving effect 
                      to international human rights law, it is scarcely surprising 
                      that the courts, as a branch of government, are also taking 
                      such law into account in appropriate cases and in permissible 
                      circumstances; and 
                    <p align="left"> (7) The developments just described are hardly 
                      surprising or threatening, at least to judges and lawyers 
                      of the common law tradition. The basic international human 
                      rights instruments were, for the most part, drafted lawyers 
                      of that tradition. In countries such as Australia, Britain, 
                      Canada, India, New Zealand and Sri Lanka and so forth, their 
                      concepts are enshrined, to varying extents, in constitutional, 
                      statutory or common law principles. It is the jurisprudence 
                      which is now collecting around these broad concepts that 
                      is often helpful in facing the kinds of problems which societies 
                      must solve today <a name="FOOTBODY_71"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_71">71</a></sup> 
                      . That is why it is appropriate and useful for the common 
                      law now to modify its earlier monistic principle of strict 
                      separation of international and domestic law. It is timely 
                      that a <i> rapprochement </i> between these systems of law 
                      should be gradually developed. As we enter a new millennium 
                      where there will be increasing international law of every 
                      kind, it is part of the genius of the national legal systems 
                      that the courts should have found a way to take cognisance 
                      of international jurisprudence in appropriate circumstances 
                      and by orthodox and familiar techniques of judicial reasoning. 
                    <p align="left"> TOWARD THE NEW MILLENNIUM 
                    <p align="left"> As international law grows in quantity, variety, 
                      subject matter and importance, it is both inevitable and 
                      proper that national legislatures will seek (where their 
                      Constitutions do not already so provide) to have a more 
                      effective say in the consideration of ratification of treaties 
                      <a name="FOOTBODY_72"></a> <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_72">72</a></sup> 
                      and in their impact on domestic law. The task of reconciling 
                      the growing body of international law with the domestic 
                      legal system remains an important and acute one. In the 
                      process of reconciliation, the three branches of government 
                      have their respective functions to perform. The judicial 
                      branch can scarcely ignore the developments of international 
                      law relevant to the cases before the judges. In the matter 
                      of fundamental human rights of universal application, it 
                      is inevitable, as Justice Brennan said in <i> Mabo</i> <a name="FOOTBODY_73"></a> 
                      <sup><a href="#FOOTNOTE_73">73</a></sup> <i> , </i> that 
                      the influence of international law will increase and that 
                      the mutual adjustment of the two universes will continue. 
                    <p align="left"> Each modern judge and lawyer has a duty to 
                      contribute to this process. It is the way of the future. 
                      That is why it is unsurprising that the influence of the 
                      <i> Bangalore Principles </i> throughout the world continues 
                      to gather pace. The achievements of the first decade will 
                      seem insignificant when the second decade closes.

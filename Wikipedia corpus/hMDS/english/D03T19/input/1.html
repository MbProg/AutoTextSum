      <h3><a href="contents"> Inquiry into the Australian Legal Aid System</a> 
      </h3>

      <h2 align="left">Chapter 4</h2>
      <h3 align="left">Implications of the <i>Dietrich</i> decision</h3>
      <h3>Introduction </h3>
      <p>4.1 Term of reference 8 requires the Committee to inquire into and report 
        on the following matter:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>The implications, if any, for the Legal Aid system that arise 
          from the High Court </cite><cite><i>Dietrich</i></cite><cite> decision. 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <p>4.2 Accordingly, in this Chapter the Committee briefly examines the <em>Dietrich</em> 
        decision. It then reviews the evidence to the inquiry on the implications 
        of the decision for the legal aid system in Australia. Finally, it notes 
        some of the responses by governments to these implications.</p>
      <h3>The decision </h3>
      <p>4.3 Olaf Dietrich was charged in Victoria with four heroin-related offences. 
        He pleaded not guilty to the charges. He sought legal aid to defend the 
        matters without success from the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria, although 
        it offered to assist him with a guilty plea. He was subsequently unsuccessful 
        in obtaining legal aid from the Commonwealth Attorney-General.</p>
      <p>4.4 As a result Dietrich was unrepresented at his trial in 1988, which 
        lasted some forty days. He was convicted on the first and most serious 
        charge, that of importing a trafficable quantity of heroin in contravention 
        of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), and was sentenced to a term of seven years 
        imprisonment. The second and third charges were alternatives to the first, 
        and so no verdict was required. He was acquitted on the fourth charge, 
        which related to possession of heroin.</p>
      <p>4.5 During his trial Dietrich emphasised on several occasions the difficulties 
        he was under in conducting his own defence, and the Crown did not later 
        dispute that these were real difficulties. Dietrich was refused leave 
        to appeal by the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal. He then sought special 
        leave from the High Court to appeal to it on the ground that his trial 
        had miscarried because he had not been provided with legal representation.</p>
      <p>4.6 In November 1992, a majority of the High Court, in Dietrich v The 
        Queen, <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_1">[1]</a> decided that where an indigent 
        defendant <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_2">[2]</a> is charged with a serious 
        criminal offence and, through no fault of his or her own, is unrepresented, 
        a trial judge should normally grant a stay or an adjournment if the accused 
        requests one. The purpose of the stay is to allow the accused the opportunity 
        to seek legal representation. This is the basis of what is commonly referred 
        to as &quot;the Dietrich principle&quot;.</p>
      <p>4.7 It should be noted that the Court explicitly recognised that there 
        is no &quot;right&quot; to legal representation at public expense. However, 
        the Court's decision was premised on the common law right that an accused 
        receive a fair trial and that legal representation is a component of a 
        fair trial for a serious criminal offence. The reasoning of the majority 
        is reflected in the following passage from the judgment of Mason CJ and 
        McHugh J: </p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>it should be accepted that Australian law does not recognise 
          that an indigent accused on trial for a serious criminal offence has 
          a right to the provision of counsel at public expense. Instead, Australian 
          law acknowledges that an accused has the right to a fair trial and that, 
          depending on all the circumstances of the particular case, lack of representation 
          may mean that an accused is unable to receive, or did not receive, a 
          fair trial. Such a finding is, however, inextricably linked to the facts 
          of the case and the background of the accused. </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_3"><cite>[3]</cite></a><cite> 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <p>4.8 Mason CJ and McHugh J also set out the approach a trial judge should 
        take if faced with an unrepresented indigent accused charged with a serious 
        criminal offence:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>In view of the differences in the reasoning of the members of 
          the Court constituting the majority in the present case, it is desirable 
          that, at the risk of some repetition, we identify what the majority 
          considers to be the approach which should be adopted by a trial judge 
          who is faced with an application for an adjournment or a stay by an 
          indigent accused charged with a serious offence who, through no fault 
          on his or her part, is unable to obtain legal representation. In that 
          situation, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the trial in 
          such a case should be adjourned, postponed or stayed until legal representation 
          is available. If, in those circumstances, an application that the trial 
          be delayed is refused and, by reason of the lack of representation of 
          the accused, the resulting trial is not a fair one, any conviction of 
          the accused must be quashed by an appellate court for the reason that 
          there has been a miscarriage of justice in that the accused has been 
          convicted without a fair trial. </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_4"><cite>[4]</cite></a><cite> 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <p>4.9 The Dietrich principle has been widely applied in Australian courts. 
        In addition to its application in indictable proceedings in District and 
        Supreme Courts, it has been held by the South Australian Supreme Court 
        that there is no reason why the Dietrich principle should not apply in 
        a hearing of a serious criminal offence in summary proceedings before 
        a Magistrate. <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_5">[5]</a></p>
      <h3>Implications of <i>Dietrich</i> </h3>
      <p>4.10 Most submissions and witnesses welcomed the principles enunciated 
        in the Dietrich decision. However, several specific concerns were raised 
        about its implications for the legal aid system. The Committee has identified 
        the following main areas of concern. These are:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <li>its potential to direct legal aid funding to criminal law matters 
          at the expense of civil and family law matters; </li>
        <li>its impact on the legal aid assessment criteria for determining an 
          applicant's means and the merits of his or her case; </li>
        <li>its potential to increase the incentive for an accused to defend charges 
          rather than plead guilty; </li>
        <li>the consequential impact of these points on legal aid funding; and 
        </li>
        <li>the associated impacts on the administration of justice. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Directs funding to criminal law matters </h3>
      <p>4.11 Several witnesses maintained that the Dietrich principle has a significant 
        implication for the legal aid system in Australia because it directs more 
        expenditure to one specific area, that is to serious criminal law matters. 
        In a funding situation in which resources are limited, this in turn is 
        said to produce a proportionate reduction in the funding available for 
        other types of cases. <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_6">[6]</a> It was argued 
        that these other cases, including civil and family law cases, have implications 
        for the participants which are just as serious as the imprisonment which 
        may result from criminal law matters.</p>
      <p>4.12 In the past, criminal law matters have received a significant proportion 
        of the legal aid funding provided through legal aid commissions. National 
        Legal Aid advised the Committee that over the last five years, the percentage 
        of criminal law matters as part of the overall case-mix of legal aid commission 
        work has steadily increased. National Legal Aid added:</p>
      <p>Criminal law currently accounts for 74% of approvals, family law for 
        19% and civil law for 7%. Over the five year period [from December 1990 
        to September 1995], approvals in grants of aid for criminal law matters 
        have increased 9.2%, family law matters have decreased by 0.3% and civil 
        law matters have increased by 2.9%. <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_7">[7]</a> 
      </p>
      <p>4.13 The Committee was told that the Dietrich principle has been used 
        by accused persons in a number of complex and lengthy white collar criminal 
        prosecutions. <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_8">[8]</a> Mr Alan Cameron, the 
        Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, noted that there have 
        been particular problems with certain defendants in Corporations Law prosecutions 
        resorting to Dietrich stays of proceedings through want of legal assistance. 
        Mr Cameron observed:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>Major prosecutions under the Corporations Law tend to be regarded 
          by the Courts as the kind of cases which no one can be expected to defend 
          without legal assistance. Applying the </cite><cite><i>Dietrich</i></cite><cite> 
          principle, the Courts have ruled that individuals who ought to have 
          legal assistance to defend themselves, and do not have that assistance, 
          can seek a permanent stay of the proceedings against them. </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_9"><cite>[9]</cite></a><cite> 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <h3>Impact on legal aid assessment criteria </h3>
      <p>4.14 In assessing a person's eligibility to receive legal aid, the funding 
        body generally applies a means test and a merits test. The former assesses 
        the ability of the applicant to pay or contribute to the cost of their 
        legal representation. The latter assesses the merits of the case the applicant 
        wishes to present in court and, for example leads to a denial of funding 
        if the prospect of the case succeeding is assessed as minimal. The use 
        of merits tests aims to ensure that scarce legal aid funds are directed 
        to the most meritorious cases.</p>
      <p>4.15 The concern has been expressed that in two respects the Dietrich 
        principle does not fit into the existing assessment criteria. Firstly, 
        it is not altogether clear whether the criteria in the means tests are 
        identical with the requirements to determine &quot;indigence&quot; under 
        the Dietrich principle. Secondly, and more seriously, the Dietrich principle 
        does not contain any equivalent to the merits test. On this point, National 
        Legal Aid told the Committee:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>Those LACs previously imposing a merits test on applicants are 
          effectively no longer able to continue this practice, particularly in 
          cases where a trial is stayed along </cite><cite><i>Dietrich</i></cite><cite> 
          lines, where the refusal to fund is based on merit. </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_10"><cite>[10]</cite></a><cite> 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <p>4.16 The Legal Services Commission of South Australia stated in its submission 
        to the Committee:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>The </cite><cite><i>Dietrich</i></cite><cite> decision has, perhaps 
          subliminally, resulted in a watering down of the Legal Services Commission's 
          merits test, in that we have tended to fund indigent accused, faced 
          with serious charges for trial, where the merits as they are presented 
          to the Legal Services Commission, have been equivocal, and very borderline 
          in terms of satisfying the merits test. This has been done in an effort 
          to avoid prolonged examination of merits, protracted correspondence 
          and dialogue, and the wasted resource of a partial or full </cite><cite><i>Dietrich</i></cite><cite> 
          hearing, in cases where it is quite clear that the discretion of the 
          Director would subsequently have to be invoked to approve funding for 
          trial. </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_11"><cite>[11]</cite></a><cite> 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <h3>Increased incentive to plead not guilty </h3>
      <p>4.17 The Committee was told that the Dietrich principle may provide an 
        incentive for indigent people accused of serious crime to defend charges 
        rather than to plead guilty. For example, National Legal Aid states:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>While there are still incentives for people to plead guilty, 
          for example, sentence indication for early pleas in NSW, more accused 
          persons may be likely to defend charges, rather than pleading guilty, 
          knowing that the Courts will virtually insist on Legal Aid being made 
          available. This would result in an increased cost to LACs... </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_12"><cite>[12]</cite></a><cite> 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <h3>Increased pressure on funding </h3>
      <p>4.18 The Committee received submissions and heard evidence that the Dietrich 
        principle is likely to significantly increase pressure on legal aid commission 
        budgets and more generally, the costs to the criminal justice system. 
        <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_13">[13]</a> </p>
      <p>4.19 The Committee received conflicting evidence on the actual effect 
        so far of the Dietrich principle on legal aid budgets. For example, the 
        Legal Services Commission of South Australia estimated in its submission 
        to the Committee's inquiry that as of May 1996, Dietrich's case has caused 
        it to fund approximately $250,000 worth of matters that it would have 
        not funded according to its guidelines and to expend approximately $150,000 
        in administration costs. <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_14">[14]</a> The Legal 
        Aid Commission of Tasmania similarly observed that the &quot;Dietrich 
        decision has resulted in more cases being funded for trial than might 
        have been the case.&quot; <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_15">[15]</a> </p>
      <p>4.20 On the other hand, the submission from the Victorian Government 
        stated &quot;the initial concerns expressed by some people about Dietrich 
        and the operation of s. 360A and their effect on the legal aid budget 
        have, so far, not come to pass&quot;. <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_16">[16]</a> 
        The submission from Victoria Legal Aid noted:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>Although there was concern that this provision [section 360A 
          of the </cite><cite><i>Crimes Act 1958</i></cite><cite>] would have 
          a significant impact on the Legal Aid Fund which Victoria Legal Aid 
          could not predict or control, that has not in fact proven to be the 
          case (so far). There have been less than 25 orders made under this section. 
          Almost all of them have been made for trials of two weeks or less duration 
          where VLA had been prepared to grant assistance for a plea in any event 
          (but not a contest). </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>There are probably two main reasons for the limited application 
          of this section: </cite></p>
        <ul class='links'>
          <li><cite>First, the courts have applied it with care. Judges have applied 
            VLA's means test to assess whether an accused could afford legal representation 
            and then have made orders on VLA's usual terms and conditions of assistance. 
            </cite></li>
          <li><cite>Secondly, there are other significant barriers in Victoria 
            which prevent defendants frivolously contesting charges brought against 
            them ... [including] the provisions of the Sentencing Act which require 
            courts to take a guilty plea into account in fixing a sentence. </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_17"><cite>[17]</cite></a><cite> 
            </cite></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>4.21 The implications of the <em>Dietrich</em> principle for legal aid 
        were succinctly summarised by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of 
        Western Australia, the Hon David Malcolm AC, when he appeared before the 
        Committee. He told the Committee:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>It would seem to me that resort to the </cite><cite><i>Dietrich</i></cite><cite> 
          principle is likely to become much more frequent as a result of the 
          cutbacks in legal aid, unless there is some compensating source of funding 
          which is made available to meet the Commonwealth cutbacks. Let me explain 
          it in this way: the Legal Aid Commission in Western Australia had put 
          a $20,000 cap on funding of criminal trials. I understand that is being 
          reduced to $10,000. That is going to mean that any trial which will 
          last more than a few days is going to become the subject of a </cite><cite><i>Dietrich</i></cite><cite> 
          application. There are many of those trials, so inevitably there will 
          be an increase in </cite><cite><i>Dietrich</i></cite><cite> applications. 
          There is also a risk that it will simply become a delaying tactic which 
          will be adopted by people. They are perfectly entitled to make the application. 
          There will have to be a hearing about whether they are indigent or not. 
          </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_18"><cite>[18]</cite></a><cite> </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <p>4.22 The Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department noted:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>If governments are concerned to ensure that prosecutions proceed 
          and are not frustrated by </cite><cite><i>Dietrich</i></cite><cite> 
          applications it is up to them to provide ways for legal assistance to 
          be granted without adversely affecting LAC's budgets. This occurs in 
          Western Australia, where, if the LAC is not prepared to grant aid and 
          a </cite><cite><i>Dietrich</i></cite><cite> application is successful, 
          the State Government provides special funds for representation which 
          are administered by the LAC but do not come from the LAC's budget. </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_19"><cite>[19]</cite></a><cite> 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <h3>Associated impacts on the administration of justice </h3>
      <p>4.23 The Committee's terms of reference relate to the implications of 
        the Dietrich decision for legal aid. In this section it briefly notes 
        some of the other implications of the decision that were identified in 
        the evidence it received.</p>
      <p>4.24 In the event that legal representation is not available from any 
        quarter, the initially temporary Dietrich stay has the potential to act 
        as quasi permanent stay of the criminal prosecution. The Committee heard 
        evidence that this might have an adverse impact on the credibility of 
        the justice system.</p>
      <p>4.25 The New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Nicholas 
        Cowdery QC, stated in his submission to the Committee's inquiry that if 
        there is no legal aid for indigent accused charged with serious criminal 
        offences:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>People who have committed serious crimes, including murder and 
          rape - perhaps dangerous people - will have to be released (at least 
          on bail) and the community will be at risk from their reoffending. Victims 
          of their crimes will live in fear. </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_20"><cite>[20]</cite></a><cite> 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <p>4.26 The Victorian Government observed that where legal aid pursuant 
        to the Dietrich principle is not available at the time of trial, the trial 
        may have to be adjourned. It then commented:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>Delays to trials and summary hearings undermines the credibility 
          of the legal system. Where witnesses and defendants find themselves 
          the subject of repeated systemic delay, the &quot;trust&quot; they feel 
          in the system may be severely eroded. Such delays, and in particular 
          permanent stays of proceedings based on the decision in </cite><cite><i>Dietrich 
          v R</i></cite><cite>, also reduce community confidence in the ability 
          of the system to deal with serious crime. </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_21"><cite>[21]</cite></a><cite> 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <h3>Living with the <i>Dietrich</i> principle </h3>
      <p>4.27 The thrust of the evidence received by the Committee was to support 
        the Dietrich principle. Many witnesses praised the decision as an important 
        procedural safeguard for accused persons and considered the principle 
        for which the case stands a desirable one. <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_22">[22]</a> 
        The Queensland Bar Association, for example, observed that the Dietrich 
        decision recognises the fundamental significance of legal representation 
        in a democratic society:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>There can be no argument with the concept that citizens (no matter 
          how heinous the allegation against them) whose liberty is at issue are 
          deserving of legal representation. In cases where such citizens do not 
          have sufficient means to arrange their own representation it is a fundamental 
          obligation of our society to provide it from the public purse. To contend 
          otherwise would be to deny the free and democratic basis upon which 
          our society operates. </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_23"><cite>[23]</cite></a><cite> 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <p>4.28 A number of witnesses also praised the Dietrich decision because 
        it complements Australia's international human rights obligations. <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_24">[24]</a></p>
      <p>4.29 The majority of the evidence to the Committee favoured an approach 
        that sought to overcome the consequential problems it may have raised, 
        rather than seeking simply to overturn the High Court decision. However, 
        the Committee was told that the options for overcoming the consequential 
        problems raised by Dietrich were very limited. <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_25">[25]</a> 
        The Committee notes that attempts to overcome the consequential problems 
        have involved:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <li>legislation by Victoria; </li>
        <li>consideration by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General; and 
        </li>
        <li>revised procedures by the legal aid commissions. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Legislation by Victoria </h3>
      <p>4.30 In 1993, Victoria legislated in response to the Dietrich decision. 
        It is the only jurisdiction to have done so, although the Committee was 
        told that the South Australian Government has also been considering legislation. 
        <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_26">[26]</a></p>
      <p>4.31 As a result, subsection 360A(2) of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) gives 
        the court the power to direct Victoria Legal Aid to provide assistance 
        to an indigent accused person, on any conditions specified by the court, 
        if the court is satisfied that this is necessary to ensure a fair trial. 
        The subsection gives the court the power to adjourn the trial until the 
        assistance has been provided. Subsection 360A(1) states:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>Subject to sub-section (2) and despite any rule of law to the 
          contrary ... the fact that an accused has been refused legal assistance 
          in respect of a trial is not a ground for an adjournment or stay of 
          the trial. </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <p>4.32 The effect of the legislation is that the judge directs that legal 
        aid shall be provided as a condition of allowing the trial to proceed, 
        thus bypassing the assessment that would otherwise be done by the legal 
        aid authorities. Without the legislation, the judge before whom the Dietrich 
        application was made out could only issue a stay order. It would then 
        be up to the legal aid authorities to assess if legal aid would be granted, 
        and this assessment might involve duplication of the work done by the 
        judge in arriving at the decision to apply the Dietrich principle. The 
        stay order would remain in effect until such time, if ever, as the legal 
        aid authorities decided to grant the aid.</p>
      <p>4.33 As noted above, the initial concerns held by some that the Victorian 
        scheme would have unacceptable effects on the legal aid budget have not 
        so far been realised.</p>
      <h3>Consideration by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General </h3>
      <p>4.34 Issues arising from the Dietrich principle have been considered 
        by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) since February 1993. 
        The Committee requested information from the Commonwealth Attorney-General's 
        Department concerning the progress of SCAG's handling of the issues. </p>
      <p>4.35 On 5 March 1997, the Department replied that the Dietrich matter:</p>
      <ul class='links'>
        <p><cite>was on the SCAG agenda in 1993. A Working Party reported to Ministers 
          in June 1993 resulting in model legislation being prepared for consideration 
          by SCAG in late 1993. No consensus was reached and no State nor Territory 
          has made the changes recommended in 1993. These were that legal aid 
          commissions' means tests be used to determine indigence and that commissions 
          be allowed to be reimbursed from an accused's assets restrained under 
          proceeds of crime legislation. </cite></p>
        <p><cite>The </cite><cite><i>Dietrich</i></cite><cite> issue was relisted 
          on the agenda for SCAG in July 1995 at the request of the Commonwealth 
          following expressions of concern about the issue from several commissions' 
          Directors. Further draft model legislation has been prepared for consideration 
          by all jurisdictions. The Commonwealth is awaiting comments on the draft 
          legislation. No jurisdiction has yet commented, despite the legislation 
          having been put to SCAG at its July 1996 meeting. </cite><a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_27"><cite>[27]</cite></a><cite> 
          </cite></p>
      </ul>
      <h3>Revised procedures by the legal aid commissions </h3>
      <p>4.36 In some States, such as Western Australia, the procedure for handling 
        Dietrich applications has become relatively settled. In Western Australia, 
        it has been the practice of the State government to make funds available 
        for an indigent person's defence after a successful Dietrich application. 
        The person's legal representation will then be arranged by the Western 
        Australian Legal Aid Commission as agent for the State government. Up 
        to January 1997, there had been eleven cases stayed under the Dietrich 
        principle. <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_28">[28]</a></p>
      <p>4.37 In other States, the State Attorneys-General have also, on occasion, 
        intervened and made funds available to allow prosecutions to proceed. 
        In NSW, the problem caused by lack of legal aid has been exacerbated by 
        the policy of the Legal Aid Commission of NSW not to fund retrials and 
        there have been a number of celebrated cases where there has been uncertainty 
        over whether legal assistance would be available and whether the retrial 
        would proceed. <a href="c07#FOOTNOTE_29">[29]</a></p>
      <p><b>Conclusion and Recommendation Nos: 4 and 5</b> </p>
      <p>The Committee notes the evidence suggesting that the impact of the <i>Dietrich</i> 
        principle will be severe for the budgets of the providers of legal aid. 
        It also notes that this impact has not yet eventuated, and may not do 
        so. It appeared to the Committee that precise information on the impact 
        is not available. </p>
      <p>The Committee <b>recommends</b> that the Commonwealth should ensure that 
        the impact of the <i>Dietrich</i> principle on the legal aid system is 
        monitored. </p>
      <p>The Committee further <b>recommends</b> that the Attorney-General take 
        up in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General the need for it to complete 
        its consideration of the impact of the <i>Dietrich</i> principle as a 
        matter of priority. </p>

      <p><a name="FOOTNOTE_24">[24]</a> The Committee notes however that Australia's 
        international obligations may extend beyond the provision of legal aid 
        to indigent defendants charged with serious offences, in particular to

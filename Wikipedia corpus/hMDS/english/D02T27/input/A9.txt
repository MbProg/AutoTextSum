September 10 in Texas History….
.
Spanish regulations changes frontier line in Texas
On this day in 1772, the New Regulations for Presidios were formally issued by King Charles III of Spain.
They changed the settlement pattern of Texas.
Since Spain had acquired the Louisiana Territory from France near the conclusion of the French and Indian War (1754-63), Texas was no longer needed as a buffer against French designs, and the expense of maintaining military establishments in East Texas could be eliminated.
The New Regulations were based on a 1769 report prepared by the Marqués de Rubí after he led a massive, twenty-three-month inspection tour from Sonora to Texas.
The regulations established the Provincias Internas, a huge semiautonomous administrative unit of nine provinces, including Texas, and a defensive cordon along the new "realistic" frontier that consisted of fifteen presidios spaced 100 miles apart.
This new frontier ran from the Gulf of California to El Paso, then along the Rio Grande to San Juan Bautista, and thence to Matagorda Bay.
Although San Antonio was behind the line, it was not abandoned because of obligations to Spanish settlers and converted Indians there.

Another chapter in Texas History
NEW REGULATIONS FOR PRESIDIOS.
Near the conclusion of the French and Indian War (1754–63), Spain acquired the Louisiana Territory from France.
The transfer meant that Texas no longer served as a buffer against French designs, and the expense of maintaining military establishments in East Texas could be eliminated without risk of foreign aggression.
Since the missions in East Texas and at El Orcoquisac on the lower Trinity River had enjoyed limited success at best, they, too, could be closed.
Those considerations weighed heavily on a budget-conscious crown that had long been overburdened with costly wars in Europe and America.
But as always, Charles III moved cautiously.
The king sought to balance the need for economy in government with the continuing problems posed by unreduced Indian nations on the northern frontier of New Spain.
To this end, he sent the Marqués de Rubí on a massive inspection tour from Sonora to Texas that covered more than 7,000 miles over a span of twenty-three months.
The inspection began in the spring of 1766 and ended in early 1768.
In the following year Rubí submitted a report to the crown that was highly critical of its northern empire.
He distinguished between a "realistic" and an expanding frontier.
The former ran from the Gulf of California to El Paso, then along the Rio Grande to San Juan Bautista, and thence to Matagorda Bay.
Two communities, Santa Fe and San Antonio, lay well to the north of this line, but because of obligations to Spanish settlers and converted Indians they could not be abandoned.
The marqués envisioned a defensive cordon along the "realistic" frontier that consisted of fifteen presidios spaced 100 miles apart, each staffed by fifty men and officers.
Since only three existing presidios fitted into the cordon, six new ones were required and six others would have to be moved-all at enormous cost.
But Rubí projected a savings of 79,929 pesos over then-current annual expenses, although he did not factor in the cost of constructing and relocating twelve presidios.
He also recommended an Indian policy, which if implemented would have been fatal to many Apache groups, especially the Lipans.
Henceforth, all Spanish commitments to the Apache nations should be abandoned.
Implementation of a policy expressly intended either to subdue or exterminate the Apaches could best be accomplished by forging an alliance with the Apaches' enemies, the Comanches and Norteños.
Charles III and his advisers studied the Rubí proposal for nearly two years.
After careful consideration, the New Regulations for Presidios were first printed in Mexico in 1771 and then formally issued by the king on September 10, 1772.
They called for the establishment of the Provincias Internas, which included Nueva Vizcaya, Sonora, Sinaloa, California, New Mexico, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Texas, Nuevo León, and Nuevo Santander.
The new plan specified the pay for chaplains, officers, and men; spelled out armament, mounts, and clothing; and detailed the responsibilities of command personnel.
With little modification, the recommendations of Rubí on the positioning of presidios carried the weight of royal edict.
To ensure implementation, Hugo Oconór, former ad interim governor of Texas, received promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel and became commandant inspector of presidios.
Alignment of presidios along the proposed cordon was soon begun.
The marqués's harsh "final solution" to the Apache problem did not fare so well.
The New Regulations stressed the tranquil objectives of the king in his realms, as well as the general welfare and conversion of peaceful Indians.
They did call for warfare against enemy nations but prohibited the ill treatment of prisoners.
Captives and their women and children were to be given food and assistance "in order to procure their conversion and instruction."
In the words of Sidney B. Brinckerhoff and Odie B. Faulk, the New Regulations of 1772 "reflected the best thinking of the day."
Their conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the system later was adopted by the Mexican nation and remained in force until 1848.
PRESIDIOS.
When the Spanish frontier expanded northward from central Mexico, the presidio, the mission, and the civil settlement became related frontier institutions for supporting Spanish colonization.
Spanish missions generally were accompanied by presidios.
Martín Enríquez, fourth viceroy of New Spain (1568–80), is generally credited with originating the presidios of the Southwest.
He ordered the construction along the main road from Mexico City north to Zacatecas of casas fuertes ("fortified houses").
Eventually the name was changed to presidio (from Latin praesidium, "garrisoned place").
The pattern of the early presidios was learned from the Moors and dated from the days of the reconquest in Spain.
By the early eighteenth century, when Spaniards settled Texas, it had changed but little.
The presidios in Texas were Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de los Tejas (1716), San Antonio de Béxar (1718), Nuestra Señora de Loreto and Nuestra Señora del Pilar de los Adaes (both 1721), San Francisco Xavier de Gigedo (1751), San Agustín de Ahumada (1756), San Luis de las Amarillas (1757), and San Elizario (1789).
Across the Rio Grande, other presidios important to Texas included Presidio del Norte, San Juan Bautista, and San Gregorio de Cerralvo.
Presidio soldiers engaged in military operations from the Pecos River to the Red River, among them the campaigns of Vicente Rodríguez and Diego Ortiz Parrilla.
Each presidio had a specific role.
Dolores protected the 1716 missions in East Texas and served as a listening post on the French.
Loreto (also known as La Bahía Presidio) patrolled the coast against invaders and rescued shipwreck victims.
Los Adaes countered the Louisiana French established at Natchitoches.
San Agustín curbed French trading activities along the coast.
San Luis de las Amarillas (also known as San Sabá Presidio) served as a buffer for San Antonio against raids by the northern tribes (Norteños), including Comanches.
Presidios were constructed of local building materials (sometimes adobe, sometimes log).
Where stone was available it was preferred for the permanent structure.
The forts were typically square or rectangular with some walls ten feet high.
On two diagonal corners, round bastions (torreones) were placed.
These rose above the walls of the presidio and were pierced with firing ports, through which soldiers could fire down the length of all four walls at attackers.
There were occasional variations, as at Los Adaes in East Texas, which had wooden palisades and diamond-shaped bastions.
Buildings were contained by walls eighteen feet apart, the roofs of which were high enough to serve as parapets from which men also could fire over the walls.
A presidio included storage facilities, a chapel, and quarters for officers and men.
The only openings were a main gate, which locked from the inside, and sometimes a rear gate.
The two urban presidios on the northern frontier, at San Antonio and Santa Fe, had no walls, no towers, and no barracks, although the presidio at San Antonio was enclosed by a stockade, as Governor Domingo Cabello y Robles reported in 1781.
In both cases the residence of the governor-captain was situated on the town plaza, as also were a guardhouse and the chapel, while the soldiers lived in their huts in town.
The systems of fortification being developed in Europe during the eighteenth century by such men as French military engineer Sébastien le Prestre (the Marquis de Vauban), who died in 1707, and Menno van Coehoorn had only slight influence on frontier Spanish presidios.
The Indians of the region had no cannons with which to blast fortress walls, and most officers in frontier service were slaves to tradition.
Thus they continued to rely on traditional, inexpensive designs and materials that produced forts little different from the fortresses erected in Spain during medieval days.
P
residio soldiers assigned to protect the missions also conducted supply trains, escorted missionaries, colonists, and merchants, carried the mail, and explored the country.
At the missions, soldiers' aggressiveness and conduct toward Indian women occasionally caused problems.
The soldiers usually brought families or else married local Christian natives.
Their families constituted a permanent Spanish population in the new land.
Conferences with Indians were conducted at presidios, which thus functioned as frontier Indian agencies.
The presidios were oases of safety for travelers who camped in their shadows.
Around them the soldiers and their families built homes.
Merchants came to sell goods, farmers came to plant their crops, and small civil settlements grew.
The soldiers in these presidios lived lives of considerable hardship and danger.
When the Marqués de Rubí inspected the northern frontier, including Texas, in 1766–68, he found an almost total lack of discipline.
Soldiers had not been instructed in using their firearms, most of them were deeply in debt because their salaries were in arrears, and their equipment and arms had badly deteriorated or were lacking altogether.
Officers were profiteering by selling inferior goods to the soldiers at inflated prices, and morale was shot through with insubordination.
Rubí sought not only to correct abuses, but to withdraw from the desired frontier to a real one and take up more defensible positions.
He recommended that the presidios of the northern frontier be reorganized into a chain of fifteen forts stretching from the Gulf of California to the Gulf of Mexico, each approximately forty leagues from the next to allow quick communication and the rapid dispatch of help.
The soldiers in the garrisons were to be properly equipped, regularly paid, and carefully instructed in their duties.
Despite the efforts of Rubí and other high officers on the northern frontier, soldiers stationed in the fifteen presidios and capital cities of San Antonio and Santa Fe were never able to conquer the Comanches, Apaches, Navajos, and other nomadic warring tribes for two reasons.
First, the strategy of building forts across the northern frontier was based on concepts of European warfare.
In the Old World, armies would advance on a fortified city and halt to invest it.
If they failed, they retreated.
The Indians in the New World saw no reason to attack a presidio; they preferred to ride around it to attack civilian settlements, ranches, and farms.
Second, each Spanish soldier was so burdened with weapons and equipment that he needed some six mounts to undertake a campaign.
Presidial compounds were not large enough to hold the horses, which therefore had to be picketed some distance away from presidios-and thus were conveniently gathered for Indians to steal.
The presidial soldiers could not pursue the raiders because they were left afoot.
For all their shortcomings, however, Spanish presidios served a useful purpose on the northern frontier.
Their design was so practical that the Indians of the region never were able to overcome one by frontal assault, although they did penetrate a few by stealth.
Many American traders and military leaders of a later date recognized the basic worth of presidios and chose to build their forts in the Southwest on the same pattern.
The restored Presidio La Bahía at Goliad stands today as a state monument to the Spanish presidio.
MARQUÉS DE RUBÍ (ca. 1725–?)
.
The Marqués de Rubí, Cayetano María Pignatelli Rubí Corbera y Saint Climent, Barón de Llinas, was probably born in Barcelona around 1725.
He was the son of Francisco Pignatelli y de Aymerich, a lieutenant general of the Kingdom of Aragon and ambassador to France and María Francisca Rubí Corbera y Saint Climent, second Marquesa de Rubí and Baroness of Llinas.
Rubí, who had achieved the high rank of field marshall and knight commander in the Order of Alcántara, arrived at Veracruz on November 1, 1764, as part of the expedition of Juan de Villabla, who had been sent to New Spain to organize regular army and colonial militia units.
On August 7 of the following year, King Carlos III appointed Rubí inspector of frontier presidios and commissioned him to remedy economic abuses and other urgent matters.
When notified of his commission, Rubí went to Mexico City in mid-December 1765, and remained in the capital until March 1766, when he received his instructions from Viceroy Cruillas.
On March 12 Rubí set out on his inspection, traveling first to Querétaro and then to Zacatecas.
On April 14 he was joined at Durango by Nicolás de Lafora, his engineer and mapmaker, who kept a diary of the tour, as did Rubí himself.
Discovery of a copy of the heretofore unknown diary of Rubí came in 1989, when it was found in a volume of bound documents acquired by the Barker Texas History Center at the University of Texas at Austin.
Rubí began his inspection tour in New Mexico, moved to Sonora, and then traveled eastward to Coahuila.
He crossed the Rio Grande in July 1767 and proceeded to San Luis de las Amarillas Presidio (San Sabá) by way of the upper Nueces River, where he visited the largely failed missions at El Cañón.
He left San Sabá on August 4 and reached San Antonio de Béxar on August 24, 1767.
From San Antonio, Rubí traveled to Los Adaes and began his inspection there on September 14.
Subsequently, he also inspected the presidios at El Orcoquisac and La Bahía before leaving Texas at Laredo in November 1767.
In all, Rubí's inspection of the northern frontier from the Gulf of California to Louisiana occupied him for twenty-three months, during which he traveled an estimated 7,600 miles.
As a result of his inspection, Rubí recommended that Spain reorganize its frontier defenses along a cordon of fifteen presidios, each about 100 miles apart, that would stretch from the Gulf of California to the mouth of the Guadalupe River in Texas.
Above this "real" frontier, which closely approximated the present international boundary between the United States and Mexico, Rubí advised that only San Antonio and Santa Fe be maintained, and he urged the complete abandonment of East Texas.
Finally, because of their perfidy and duplicity, Rubí recommended a war of extermination against the Lipan Apaches.
He was back in Mexico City by February 1768, and he filed his official report on April 10.
More than four years passed before a royal order commonly known as the New Regulations for Presidios was issued, on September 10, 1772.
The New Regulations had enormous impact on Texas.
They called for the abandonment of all missions and presidios in Texas except for those at San Antonio and La Bahía; the strengthening of San Antonio by designating it the new capital of Texas; the removal of soldiers and settlers in East Texas; and the implementation of a new Indian policy aimed at establishing good relations with the northern nations at the expense of the Apaches.
With respect to East Texas, Rubí's recommendations were enacted in 1773 but were soon vitiated by the return of settlers to the region and the founding of Nacogdoches in 1779.
After he sailed from Veracruz in July 1768, the remainder of Rubí's life is largely obscure.
He was summoned to court in 1769 to defend his proposals, and he was in Barcelona in April 1772.
When Carlos III died in 1788, Rubí may have accepted retirement at about the age of sixty-three.
PROVINCIAS INTERNAS.
Establishment of the Comandancia General of the Interior Provinces of New Spain (Provincias Internas) had been proposed by José de Gálvez Gallardo during his visitation (1765–71) of the viceroyalty.
His initial suggestion of 1768 had been approved in principle by King Charles III in the following year but was not implemented until after Gálvez assumed the post of minister of the Indies on January 30, 1776.
In May of that same year the king formally authorized the Provincias Internas, a huge semiautonomous administrative unit that included Texas, Coahuila, Nueva Vizcaya, New Mexico, Sinaloa, Sonora, and the two Californias (Baja and Alta).
The first capital of the Provincias Internas was the town of Arizpe on the Sonora River, equidistant between Nueva Vizcaya and the Californias.
The rationale for carving this jurisdiction from the viceroyalty of New Spain sprang from the desire to promote administrative efficiency on a frontier far removed from Mexico City, to stimulate economic development, and to protect Spanish realms from English and Russian designs.
It also came at a time when Hugo Oconór was in the field as commandant inspector of presidios on the northern frontier.
Henceforth, Oconór continued to supervise military matters until his resignation in January 1777, but he was obliged to serve under a commandant general who reported directly to the king, rather than to Oconór's friend Viceroy Antonio María Bucareli y Ursúaqv.
The new official with titles of governor and commander in chief of the Provincias Internas was Teodoro de Croix, nephew of the Marqués de Croix, former viceroy of New Spain from 1766 to 1771.
Croix's tenure (1776–83) coincided exactly with the years of the American Revolution.
In 1783 Teodoro de Croix left northern Mexico to become viceroy of Peru, and at that juncture the Provincias Internas entered an interregnum of ten years marked by brief tenures for five successive commandants general.
During that interval the official capital was Villa Chihuahua.
In 1786 the viceroy regained control of the Provincias Internas.
The restoration of viceregal authority signaled the temporary end of a single administrative unit, and the Interior Provinces were then divided into three military regions.
The eastern provinces, which included Texas, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Nuevo Santander, were placed under the command of Juan de Ugalde.
But this arrangement did not last long.
In 1787 the three regions were reduced to Eastern and Western provinces, with Ugalde and Ramón de Castro exercising control over Texas for an additional six years.
In November 1792 King Charles IV ordered that the two regions be reorganized into a single unit and again removed the Provincias Internas from the control of the viceroy of New Spain.
That juncture marked an end to the interregnum and ushered in the administration of Pedro de Nava, which lasted until 1802.
In 1804 the king reversed his position and again ordered two separate jurisdictions, but that reorganization was delayed under the administration of Commandant General Nemesio de Salcedo y Salcedo (1802–13) by Napoleon Bonaparte's designs in Spain.
The Eastern Division fell under the control of Commandant General Joaquín de Arredondo in 1813 and remained under his heavy hand until Texas joined in the Mexican nation in 1821.

Adrian Woll
Irredentist forces from Mexico try to take back Texas
On this day in 1842, Mexican general Adrián Woll, with a force of 12,000 men, captured the city of San Antonio.
Woll's expedition was part of the continued skirmishing that went on between the Texas Revolution and the Mexican War.
Woll's army was repulsed by Texan troops in the battle of Salado Creek on September 18, evacuated San Antonio two days later, and returned to Coahuila.
The Mexican government hailed Woll's Texas campaign as a success, promoted him to major general, and awarded him its Cross of Honor.
Texans responded to the attack by launching the Somervell and Mier expeditions.

Another chapter in Texas History
ADRIÁN WOLL (1795–1875).
Adrián Woll, Mexican general, was born on December 2, 1795, in St. Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, educated for the military profession, and served as a lieutenant in a lancer regiment in the imperial guard during the First Empire.
In 1815 he was a captain adjutant major in the Tenth Legion of the National Guard of the Seine.
On the restoration of Bourbon rule in France, Woll sailed for America, carrying letters of introduction to Gen. Winfield Scott, headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland.
Scott apparently pointed to the opportunities that the Mexican revolutionary movement in progress against Spain offered a young man of energy, skilled in the military arts.
On July 3, 1816, in Baltimore, Woll joined the staff of Gen. Francisco Xavier Mina as a lieutenant colonel.
He landed with Mina near the mouth of the Santander River on April 15, 1817, and assisted in seizing Soto la Marina three days later.
When the Mina expedition collapsed, Woll sought other ties to the Mexican War of Independence and cast his lot with Gen. Antonio López de Santa Anna.
With the achievement of Mexican independence, Woll remained in the Mexican army, became a naturalized citizen, and married Lucinda Vautrey Griggi.
He became a colonel in 1828 and served as an aide-de-camp to Santa Anna during the capture of Tampico from the Spaniards in 1829.
In 1832 he was promoted to brigadier general and awarded the Cross of Tampico.
He and several other officers were commissioned by Santa Anna to conduct and place in the hands of the central government in Mexico City the flag taken from the Spaniards.
In 1832 Woll supported the pronunciamento against President Anastasio Bustamante that brought Gen. M. Gómez Pedraza to the presidency.
From Guadalajara Woll led a small, well-organized force that defeated Lt. Col. Joaquín Solórzano at Taxinastla; he entered Colima on November 15 and placed Pedraza adherents in office, then moved to Morelos.
In 1835 Woll served as quartermaster general during Santa Anna's campaign that put down the Federalist uprising led by the pure-blooded Indian Juan Álvarez in the south and by Francisco García Zacatecas.
In 1836 Woll was quartermaster general of Santa Anna's army in the invasion of Texas.
On March 8 he reached San Antonio de Béxar and reported to Gen. Vicente Filisola, second in command of the Mexican forces.
After the battle of the Alamo, Woll accompanied Gen. Joaquín Ramírez y Sesma, who had orders to march with 725 men through Gonzales to San Felipe de Austin and thence to Harrisburg and Anahuac.
The force included three infantry battalions, two six-pounder cannons, and forty dragoons.
Ramírez y Sesma confronted Gen. Sam Houston and a Texan army on the opposite bank of the Colorado River at Beeson's Ferry, near the site of present-day Columbus, and began crossing.
Houston retreated.
On April 5, when Santa Anna reached Atascosito Pass on the Colorado, Woll assigned a battalion to construct rafts to ferry across the remainder of the army, which was arriving under Filisola.
Santa Anna then proceeded with a division to San Felipe-and defeat at the battle of San Jacinto.
On April 26 Woll became Filisola's chief of staff.
Informed of Santa Anna's surrender, Filisola dispatched Woll to the Texan camp as an emissary under the pretext of learning the terms of the armistice, but actually to gain information on the strength, armament, and resources of the enemy.
On April 30 Woll rode in under a truce flag and was detained.
Gen. Thomas J. Rusk, commanding the Texan army, transferred Woll to Velasco, where he was given safe conduct to Goliad and released.
Woll joined the retreating Mexican army on June 12.
In 1842 Woll claimed that during the Texas campaign he had persuaded Santa Anna to cancel his order to shoot James W. Fannin and his men, but the order could not be recalled in time.
After the Texas Revolution, Woll played an inconspicuous role in Mexican affairs.
During the brief "Pastry War" with France in 1838–39, he resigned his commission to avoid fighting against his countrymen, but the Mexican government rejected his request and placed him on inactive duty.
When the French troops withdrew, Woll joined Santa Anna and the Centralists in their struggle with the Federalists.
Late in November 1840 he went to New Orleans and negotiated for military supplies and other items, some of which may have been involved in a smuggling operation conducted by his wife at Saltillo.
In December Woll was assigned to service on the northern frontier.
In early June 1842, Woll was appointed second in command to Isidro Reyes in the Army of the North and made head of the Department of Coahuila.
During the summer he received orders to invade Texas (see MEXICAN INVASIONS OF 1842).
Woll was to capture San Antonio, then reconnoiter the Guadalupe River down to Gonzales-all within one month.
He had crossed the Rio Grande at Presidio with his Second Division by August 30 and, following a new route, entered San Antonio on September 11.
He was repulsed by Texan troops in the battle of Salado Creek on the eighteenth, evacuated San Antonio two days later, and returned to Coahuila.
The Mexican government hailed Woll's Texas campaign as a success, promoted him to major general, and awarded him its Cross of Honor.
In February 1843 Woll became commander of the Army of the North.
He served until the northern army, on December 6, 1844, joined a revolt led by José Joaquín Herrera and Gen. Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga against Santa Anna.
Woll was arrested and imprisoned, but freed under a general amnesty decree of May 24, 1845.
Earlier, while commanding on the frontier, he had served with a government commission to arrange an armistice between Mexico and Texas.
James W. Robinson, a Texan prisoner at Perote Prison, had offered proposals to settle the differences between the two countries, and Santa Anna allowed Robinson to return to Texas and present his case.
Houston declared a truce on June 15, 1843.
The commissioners of both governments signed an armistice on February 15, 1844, at Salinas, on the Rio Grande.
However, the Mexican government quickly recalled its commissioners upon learning that the Texans were negotiating in Washington for annexation to the United States and that the Texas commissioners had no authority to discuss a permanent peace.
On June 19, Woll, on instructions from Mexico City, sent Houston a formal declaration of war, and hostilities resumed.
During the United States invasion of Mexico in 1846, Woll served in the Mexican army until Santa Anna's defeat in 1847, then sailed for Europe.
In 1852 he landed in Havana, Cuba, and joined Santa Anna on his return to Mexico.
On April 20, 1853, at Santa Anna's installation as president, he appointed Woll governor and commandant general of Tamaulipas.
When revolutionary disturbances flared, his authority was extended over Nuevo León and Coahuila.
Santa Anna declared himself a dictator on December 16, 1853, but his support faded and he fled Mexico.
Woll also left.
About three and a half years later, Woll reappeared in Mexico as an adherent of President Miguel Miramón, whose Centralist regime had been attacked by Benito Juárez and the Constitutionalists.
On March 22, 1859, Woll landed at Mocambo with several prominent reactionists (Díaz de la Vega, Victor Blanco, and two sons of Santa Anna), reported to Miramón at Veragra, and was given an army command.
During the ensuing Guerra de la Reforma, he defeated Gen. S. Degollado, a liberal leader, on August 30 near León and occupied Zacatecas in November.
In May 1860 he successfully defended Guadalajara.
The Miramón government collapsed on December 24, and Juárez became the Mexican president.
Woll again returned to France.
In 1862, when Napoleon III declared war on Juárez, Woll accompanied the French troops sent to Mexico and was named commandant general of the state of Vera Cruz.
In March 1863 he met with A. Superviele, a Confederate agent, who urged the French government to seize Matamoros.
Woll also served on the Junta Superior de Gobierno, a group of thirty-five formed by the French.
The group chose three Mexican citizens to act as a temporary executive and selected 215 citizens to serve as an Asamblea de Notables.
Appointed on June 29, 1863, the Asamblea met jointly with the Junta Superior and formed a monarchy.
The executive committee, called theRegencia del Imperio Mexicano, sent Woll and eleven others as a deputation to offer the Mexican imperial crown to Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria.
Maximilian accepted the crown on April 10, 1864.
He asked Woll to draft a plan for organizing the armed forces needed in Mexico.
Woll was designated the adjutant general of the occupation forces when Maximilian landed in Mexico on May 28.
He also was named chief aide-de-camp and promoted to commander of the French order of knighthood, the Legion of Honor.
When Maximilian became displeased with Marshal François Achille Bazaine and demanded his recall, he dispatched Woll in the fall of 1865 to explain matters to Napoleon.
Woll learned that Napoleon planned to withdraw the French troops from Mexico beginning in January 1866, and he never returned to Mexico.
The French soldier of fortune died at Montauban, just north of Toulouse in southern France, in February 1875.
BATTLE OF SALADO CREEK.
Following Brig. Gen. Rafael Vásquez's raid on San Antonio in March 1842, Texan volunteers gathered in that city to launch a retaliatory raid into Mexico.
The release and repatriation of the Texan Santa Fe expedition prisoners, however, was considered a gesture of peace and good will from the Mexican government, causing President Sam Houston to withdraw his sanction from the planned incursion.
The diplomats' visions of peace, however, were shattered within a month when the Mexican army struck again, carrying off a larger scale version of the Vásquez raid.
That fall Brig. Gen. Adrián Woll, a French soldier of fortune serving in the Mexican army, crossed the Rio Grande with 1,000 regular infantry, 500 irregular cavalry, and two pieces of artillery and, on September 11 entered San Antonio.
In response, approximately 200 volunteers from Gonzales, Seguin, and other lower Colorado River settlements marched under Capt. Mathew Caldwell to the east bank of Salado Creek, seven miles from San Antonio.
There they united with Capt. John C. Hays's fourteen man ranger company that had been driven from the city with Woll's approach.
Caldwell, wishing to precipitate a fight but not strong enough to attack the Mexicans in San Antonio, dispatched Hays's men into the town at sunrise on September 18 to draw out the enemy.
If Woll could be lured into the open prairie, Caldwell reasoned, the Texans, although outnumbered, expected to give a good account of themselves from their fine defensive position in the bed of Salado Creek.
Only thirty-eight horses in the Texan camp were fit for duty, thus only thirty-eight men could go into Bexar as decoys.
Hays, accompanied by Henry E. McCulloch, William A. A. "Bigfoot" Wallace, Robert A. Gillespie, and thirty-four other Texans, arrived a mile from the city between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, dismounted, and prepared an ambush.
Hays and McCulloch then remounted and, taking six men with them, boldly ventured to within half a mile of the Alamo, taunting the Mexican cavalry to come out and fight.
Hays had hoped to be pursued by about forty or fifty Mexicans.
Instead, 400 to 500 cavalrymen chased them toward the Salado.
Woll had just completed preparations to move against Caldwell, and when Hays and McCulloch made their appearance, Woll's whole force of cavalry was already in the saddle, ready to give chase.
Woll said he "would go in person and drive the Texian wolves from the bushes."
He accordingly rode out with nearly his whole force, including a large number of the Mexican residents of Bexar, to attack Caldwell's position.
As Hays, McCulloch, and their half dozen companions approached the Texans hiding in ambush, Hays ordered them to mount and fall back.
The rangers fell back briskly across the mesquite-covered prairie toward Caldwell's position, where their comrades were camped among the cottonwoods, cedars, and live oaks of the creek bottom.
For the first four miles the Texans, with the advantage of a lead of one half a mile, kept out of reach of the Mexican cavalry without much difficulty.
Too soon, however the fresh horses captured by Woll on the eleventh began to gain on the somewhat jaded mounts of the rangers.
As the Mexicans gained ground, the Texans threw off blankets, hats, and raincoats in an attempt to lighten their horses' loads.
McCulloch, commanding the rear guard of ten picked men, pressed close upon the heels of the foremost rangers.
"The race," wrote Reverend Z. N. Morrell, "was an earnest one."
The Mexicans made a desperate effort to cut off Hays by passing his right flank.
McCulloch kept between him and the Mexicans, sending couriers every half mile or so urging Hays to put for the timber, and finally, when the timber was reached, McCulloch had only one man with him, Creed Taylor.
These two had been targets for the Mexicans for the last half mile at a range of 150 to 200 yards.
From 100 to 200 shots were fired at them on the run, but not a ball struck man or horse.
The men in camp had slaughtered a beef that morning and were engaged in cooking and eating when Hays's men dashed in, closely pursued by Mexican cavalry.
The Texans' ruse, however, had its desired effect.
The battle was joined on terrain favorable to the Texans.
Every man was soon at his post and ready for action.
"The enemy crossed the Salado above us," wrote Miles S. Bennet, and took a position several hundred yards to the east.
At about 10:00 A.M. Woll's entire command, estimated to be 1,500 men, formed and maintained continuous fire, recalled N. B. Burkett, but "on account of the distance we did not pay a great deal of attention to them."
Caldwell sent out a typically confident call for help.
"The enemy are around me on every side, but I fear them not," he wrote to the men of the nearby settlements.
Vowing to hold his position until reinforced, "Old Paint" invited the Texans to join in the sport.
"It is the most favorable opportunity I have seen," he assured his neighbors.
"I can whip them on any ground, without help, but cannot take prisoners.
Why don't you come?
Hurra for Texas."
Throughout the day Caldwell's men continued to circle their positions making themselves conspicuous so that their fighting force might appear to be greater in number to the enemy.
After a day of desultory skirmishing and artillery and small arms fire, the Mexican right and left wings attacked, leaving a clear field of fire open through their center "to play with their cannon."
"We whipped them in about fifteen minutes," wrote Burkett, "shooting some of them down within twenty steps of our lines."
Among the slain was Vicente Córdova, leader of the abortive rebellion of 1838.
After this, according to Thomas Jefferson Green, Woll "used every persuasion to make his men charge the Texians, but to no purpose.
The Texian rifle, when directed by steady nerves . . . was awfully destructive."
As the night came on and the firing ceased, Woll retired from the field.
In the day's fighting, the Mexicans reportedly lost sixty men killed and many more wounded, while only one Texan was killed and nine to twelve were wounded.
Most of the Texas volunteers were eager to counterattack and free the prisoners held within Woll's lines.
While Texan arms were enjoying success on the Salado, a tragedy was transpiring not far away.
In response to Woll's invasion, Capt. Nicholas M. Dawson had raised a fifty-three man company and marched down from La Grange.
Nearing Caldwell's embattled line on the eighteenth, it was intercepted by a column of several hundred irregular Mexican cavalry supported by a battery of two field pieces.
After a spirited but futile resistance that saw half of the command cut down by artillery fire, Dawson's men began to surrender.
Once the Texans were disarmed, however, the Mexicans again fired upon them.
Two escaped and fifteen were marched away to Perote Prison in Mexico.
Of these men, only nine would survive to return to Texas (see DAWSON MASSACRE).
Unfortunately for the Texan cause, a hard rain fell all of the next day, and consequently no advance was made.
About midnight several of the Texans entered the Mexicans' camp "to engage in a little `sport'" and found that Woll had stolen "a trick from George Washington's book by burning his camp fires" and had evacuated the city under cover of darkness.
On learning that the Mexicans had begun their retreat, the Texans followed, but were halted for the night by the muddy crossing of the Medina River below San Antonio.
No further contact was made with the retreating Mexicans until Woll was overtaken at the crossing of the Hondo River by Hays's company, riding half a mile in advance of Caldwell's main army.
Pressing rapidly forward about 3:00 P.M., the rangers came up with Woll's rear guard strongly positioned and supported by a battery commanding the road from the north.
With no knowledge of the artillery's presence, Hays charged the Mexican rear guard, driving it back upon Woll's main force and overrunning the guns before the enemy had fired half a dozen rounds.
The boldness of the charge took the Mexican army by surprise, no doubt saving Hays's command many casualties.
Hays's horse was shot from under him but only two of his men were wounded.
Woll, discovering that the rangers were supported neither by infantry nor artillery, rallied and recaptured the battery.
Severely outnumbered, the Texans fell back three or four hundred yards into a dry creek bed where Caldwell's main body joined them and began to fortify the position in anticipation of another Mexican attack.
Among the Texan officers, however, a heated difference of opinion arose as to the practicability of successfully attacking the enemy.
The usually aggressive Caldwell held a council of war, and more time was lost in discussing the situation.
McCulloch came to the front and called for volunteers to advance, and Judge John Hemphill urged the importance of an immediate attack.
But, according to John Holland Jenkins, "a lethargy had fallen upon the command that effectually retarded further progress."
As night approached on the 22nd, the Texans stood in their ranks, "suffering for water and tantalized almost to madness by the delay and want of harmony among our leaders."
At three o'clock next morning, Woll hustled his troops across the Hondo and force marched them toward the Rio Grande.
At this point, pursuit by the Texans was abandoned.
The fall of 1842 had been exceptionally rainy, and the rivers between San Antonio and the Rio Grande were experiencing an unwonted flow.
Had the command held together, continued its harassment of the retreating Mexicans, and awaited the arrival of the squads and companies of volunteers already on their way to the army, Bennet believed, Woll's army could have been destroyed before it reached Mexican soil.
As it was, Caldwell's volunteers returned from the Hondo deprived of their showdown fight with Woll's command.
Only a few miles up the road toward San Antonio they met the vanguard of Edward Burleson, arriving with reinforcements.
Green spoke for the army when he observed that "General Burleson may not be considered a tactician in the strict sense of the term, but he never failed to observe one rule in winning battles more important than all the minutiae of the drill: that rule is, to fight."
DAWSON MASSACRE.
After the capture of San Antonio on September 11, 1842, by Brig. Gen. Adrián Woll in the second of the Mexican invasions of 1842, Texan forces gathered on Salado Creek under Col. Mathew Caldwell to repel the raiders.
While Texas arms were succeeding at the battle of Salado Creek on September 18, 1842, a calamity was occurring only a mile and a half away.
In response to Caldwell's call for volunteers, Capt. Nicholas M. Dawson had raised a fifty-three-man company, mostly from Fayette County, and marched down from La Grange.
Believing Caldwell's forces to be in grave danger, Dawson's men chose not to wait for Capt. Jesse Billingsley's company, which was following them, but to disregard the threat posed by numerous heavy Mexican cavalry patrols and to fight their way to the Salado.
Near Caldwell's embattled line, between 3 and 4 P.M. on the eighteenth, the company was intercepted by a column of 500 irregular Mexican cavalry commanded by colonels Cayetano Montero, José María Carrasco, and Pedro Rangel and supported by a battery of two field pieces.
According to the accounts of several survivors, the Mexican column was commanded by Juan Nepomuceno Seguín, but they were no doubt in error.
Dawson dismounted his men in a mesquite thicket where Fort Sam Houston now stands and threatened to "shoot the first man who runs."
The Texans were quickly surrounded but repulsed a spirited cavalry charge and inflicted a number of casualties on the enemy.
The Mexicans then fell back out of rifle range and opened fire on the Texans with their artillery.
Billingsley's company, which arrived while the fight was in progress, was too weak to go to Dawson's aid, and Caldwell's men on Salado Creek were heavily engaged throughout the afternoon.
Montero once more ordered his cavalry, then dismounted, to charge.
After a vigorous but futile resistance, the severely wounded Dawson sought to surrender.
The Mexicans continued to fire, however, striking Dawson several more times.
Seeing surrender to be impossible, he gasped out his dying words, "Let victory be purchased with blood."
Alsey S. Miller took up the white mackinaw that Dawson had waved in token of surrender and rode with it toward the Mexican lines, only to be fired upon in his turn.
Miller then galloped through the enemy toward the town of Seguin.
Henry Gonzalvo Woods, after witnessing the death of his father and the mortal wounding of his brother Norman, also escaped.
Some of the Texans continued to resist while others laid down their arms.
Heroic in the fight was Griffin, a slave of Samuel A. Maverick, who, his rifle shattered, fought on with the limb of a mesquite tree until he was killed.
By 5 P.M. the fight was over.
Thirty-six Texans died on the field, fifteen were taken prisoner, and two escaped.
The prisoners were marched away to Perote Prison in Mexico.
Of these men, only nine survived to return to Texas.
Thirty Mexicans were estimated to have been killed and between sixty and seventy wounded.
Two days later the Mexican army retreated toward the Rio Grande, and the Dawson men were buried in shallow graves in the mesquite thicket where they fell.
MEXICAN INVASIONS OF 1842.
Because of Mexico's refusal to recognize the independence of Texas after the Treaties of Velasco, the republic was in constant fear of a Mexican invasion.
The fear assumed reality on January 9, 1842, when Gen. Mariano Arista issued a statement from Monterrey telling the Texans that it was hopeless for them to continue their struggle for independence and promising amnesty and protection to all who remained neutral during his planned invasion.
Early in March, Goliad, Refugio, and Victoria were occupied, and on March 5 the Mexican troops under Rafael Vásquez appeared before San Antonio.
The Texans retreated, leaving the town to the Mexicans, because John C. Hays found it impossible to gather enough men to make a defense immediately.
The militia under Alexander Somervell was called out, however, and gathered at San Antonio on March 15, but the Mexican forces had abandoned the town on March 9.
Edward Burleson, the leader of the volunteers, had no orders to follow the invaders; so the Texan force remained in San Antonio until it was disbanded on April 2.
The most unfortunate result of the raid was the panic that it caused in the western settlements.
On March 10 President Sam Houston declared a national emergency and ordered the archives removed to Houston, but the people of Austin refused to let the records be taken.
When Houston issued a second order on December 10, the struggle known as the Archive War resulted.
Meanwhile Houston had made an appeal to the United States for money and volunteers, and Adjutant General James Davisqv was sent to Corpus Christi to organize volunteers with orders to hold them until the time was opportune for an invasion of Mexico.
On June 7 Davis's forces had a skirmish with Antonio Canales Rosillo, but Canales soon retired to Mexico.
During the session of the Texas Congress that met on June 27, ten million acres of land was appropriated to finance a war of invasion against Mexico, but the bill was vetoed by Houston.
Davis's forces were dismissed, and Texas was left undefended.
On September 11, 1842, Gen. Adrián Woll, with a force of 1,200 Mexicans, captured San Antonio.
By September 17, 200 Texans had gathered on Cibolo Creek above Seguin and marched under Mathew Caldwell to Salado Creek six miles northeast of San Antonio.
On September 18 Caldwell sent Hays and a company of scouts to draw the Mexicans into a fight; the battle of Salado Creek resulted.
While the fight was going on, Capt. Nicholas M. Dawson approached from the east with a company of fifty-three men.
These men were attacked a mile and a half from the scene of the battle and killed in what came to be known as the Dawson Massacre.
Woll drew his men back to San Antonio and retreated to Mexico by September 20.
The reinforced Texans pursued him for three days and then returned to San Antonio.
By September 25 a large number of Texans had gathered at San Antonio, and plans were made for a punitive expedition, the Somervell expedition, which evolved into the Mier expedition.

Early colony holds first election
On this day in 1844, just nine days after reaching their new settlement, Henri Castro, empresario of the Republic of Texas, and his first thirty-five colonists held an election to choose two justices of the peace, a constable, and the settlement's name, Castroville.
Henri Castro, a learned, wise, and humane man, received contracts for two grants of land on which he was to establish 600 families.
In the management of his colonies, he is more comparable to Stephen F. Austin than any other Texas empresario.
He had an unbounded faith in the capacity of intelligent men for self-government.
During Castro's colony's first year the population grew to 2,134.
Although the colony suffered from Indian depredations, cholera, and the drought of 1848, the population increased sufficiently for the formation of Medina County in 1848.

CASTRO'S COLONY.
On February 15, 1842, Henri Castro, an empresario of the Republic of Texas, received contracts for two grants of land on which he was to establish 600 families.
One grant lay west of San Antonio; the other was along the Rio Grande between Camargo and La Sal del Rey.
Castro recruited his colonists in France, particularly in Alsace.
On September 1, 1844, he left San Antonio for his land grant beyond the Medina River with his first thirty-five colonists.
On September 3 the group reached its destination and began building homes.
On September 12 an election was held for two justices of the peace and a constable, and the name Castroville was adopted for the settlement.
During the colony's first year 558 headrights were issued, and 485 families and 457 single men were introduced, for a total of 2,134 settlers.
The colony suffered from Indian depredations, cholera, and the drought of 1848, but population increased sufficiently for the formation of Medina County in 1848.
The present towns of Castroville, D'Hanis, Quihi, and Vandenburg were founded by the colonists.
Brief History of Castro's Colony
With the declaration of Texian Independence, March 2nd, 1836, all prior colonial grants and contracts with Mexico or the State of Coahuila and Texas ceased.
Really and practically they ceased on the 13th of November, 1836, by a decree of the first revolutionary assembly, known as the consultation, which, as a preventive measure against frauds and villainy, wisely and honestly closed all land office business until a permanent government could be organized.
Hence, as a historical fact, the colonial contracts of Stephen F. Austin, Austin & Williams, Sterling C. Robertson, Green De Witt, Martin DeLeon, Power & Hewetson and McMullen & McGloin ceased on the 13th of November, 1835 The concessions to David G. Burnet, Joseph Vehlein and Lorenzo de Zavala, previously transferred to a New York syndicate, known as the New York and Galveston Bay Company, of which Archibald Hotchkiss, of Nacogdoches, was made resident agent, and which, in reality, accomplished little or nothing, also expired by the decree of the 13th of November, 1835.
The Republic was born March 2, 1836, and for the five succeeding years, until February 4th, 1841, in the last year of Lamar's administration, there was no law authorizing colonial contracts.
But on the last named day a law was passed authorizing the President, under conditions set forth, to enter into contracts for the colonization of wild lands in Northwest and Southwest Texas.
That act was amended January 1st, 1843.
President Lamar entered into a contract for what became known as Peters Colony, in North Texas, August 30, 1841, which was altered November 20, 1841, and, by President Houston, on the 26th of July, 1842, Houston having succeeded Lamar as President.
Under this law, besides the Peters Colony, already granted, President Houston made grants to Henry F. Fisher and Burchard Miller, for what afterwards became known as the German Colony, which did much to populate the beautiful mountain country drained by the Perdernales, Llano and San Saba rivers.
On the 15th of January, 1842, Henry Castro entered into a contract with President Houston for settling a colony west of the Medina, to continue for five years, the eastern boundary being four miles west of the Medina and cutting him off from that beautiful stream; but he bought from private parties the lands on it and thereby made the Medina his eastern boundary.
At the same time President Houston appointed Mr. Castro Texian Consul General to France.
Who was Henry Castro?
He was an educated and accomplished Frenchman, bearing a Spanish name, and was rightfully Henri de Castro.
Owing to the invasion of Texas in 1842 and other obstacles, on the 25th of December, 1844, after he had brought over seven hundred immigrants, on seven different ships, chartered at his own cost, his contract was prolonged for three years from its original period of termination - a just and honorable concession by Texas to one of such approved zeal and energy.
A volume of interest could be written descriptive of the efforts of Mr. Castro to settle his colony, then exposed to the attacks of bandit and guerrilla Mexicans but a little to its west, and to all the hostile Indians north and west of his proposed settlement.
He hurried to France and besides his official and personal affairs, did great service in aiding Gen. James Hamilton, the Texian minister, in popularizing the cause of Texas in France.
He encountered great obstacles, as the French government was using immense efforts to encourage migration to its colony in Algiers; but on the 13th of November, 1842, he dispatched the ship, Ebro, from Havre with 113 immigrants for Texas.
Soon afterwards the ships Lyons, from Havre, and the Louis Philippe, from Dunkirk, followed with immigrants, accompanied by the Abbe Menitrier.
These were followed from Antwerp on the 25th of October, 1843, by the ship, Jeane Key; and on May 4th by the Jeanette Marie.
The seven ships named brought over seven hundred colonists.
In all, in thirty-seven ships, he introduced into Texas over five thousand immigrants, farmers, orchardists and vine-growers, chiefly from the Rhenish provinces, an excellent class of industrious, law-abiding people, whose deeds " do follow them" in the beautiful gardens, fields and homes in Medina and the contiguous counties on the west.
On the 3d of September, 1844, after many delays, the heroic Castro, at the head of the first party to arrive on the ground, formally inaugurated his colony as a living fact.
A town was laid out on the west bank of the Medina, and by the unanimous vote of the colonists, named Castroville.
It was a bold step, confronting dangers unknown to the first American colonists in 1822, for besides hostile savages, now accustomed to the use of fire arms, it challenged inroads from the whole Rio Grande Mexican frontier, which, in 1822 furnished friends and not enemies to foreign settlement in Texas.
It was doing what both Spanish and Mexican power had failed to do in 153 years - 1692 to 1844 - since the first settlement at San Antonio.
It was founding a permanent settlement of civilized, Christian men, between San Antonio and the Rio Grande, the settlements and towns on which, from Matamoros (Reynosa, Camargo, Mier, Guerrero, Larioredo, Dolores, San Fernando, Santa Rosa, Presidio del Rio Grande, Presidio del Norte), bristled in hostility to Texas and its people.
It was an achievement entitling the name of Henri de Castro to be enrolled among the most prominent pioneers of civilization in modern times.
Yet the youth of to-day, joyously and peacefully galloping over the beautiful and fertile hills and valleys he rescued from savagery, are largely ignorant of his great services.
The gallant Col. John.
C. Hays, the big-hearted Col. George T. (Tom) Howard, John James, the surveyor, and, among others, the pure, warm-hearted and fatherly John M. Odin, the first Catholic Bishop of Texas, besides many generous hearted Americans, visited Castroville and bade godspeed to the new settlers from La Belle France and the Rhine.
Bishop Odin (friend of my youth and of my mother's house), laid and blessed the corner-stone of the first house dedicated to the worship of God - a service rendered before the settlers had completed respectable huts to shelter their families.
On his return from this mission the good bishop dined at my mother's house, and, though a Baptist, both by inheritance and forty-six years of membership, in the broader spirit of civilization and that spirit which embraces all true and pure hearts, regardless of party and creed, she congratulated him on the work he had done.
But in fact every man, woman and child who knew Bishop Odin (0-deen) in those years of trials and sorrow in Texas, loved him, and sorrowed when he returned to and died in his native Lombardy.
Mr. Castro, soon after inaugurating his colony, was compelled to revisit France.
He delivered a parting farewell to his people.
On the 25th of November, 1844, to the number of fifty-three heads of families, they responded.
Their address is before me.
They say: " We take pleasure in acknowledging that since the first of September -the date at which we signed the process verbal of taking possession - you have treated us like a liberal and kind father.
* * * Our best wishes accompany you on your voyage and we take this occasion to express to you our ardent desire to see you return soon among us, to continue to us your paternal protection."
Signed by Leopold Mentrier, J. H. Burgeois, George Cupples, Jean Baptiste Lecomte, Joseph Weber, Michael Simon and forty-seven others.
The Indians sorely perplexed these exposed people.
In the rear of one of their first immigrating parties, the Indians, forty miles below San Antonio, attacked and burnt a wagon.
The driver, an American, rifle in band, reached a thicket and killed several of them but they killed a boy of nineteen - a Frenchman - cut off his head and nailed it to a tree.
In the burnt wagon was a trunk containing a considerable amount of gold and silver.
In the ashes the silver was found melted - the gold only blackened.
This was one of the first parties following the advance settlers.
In this enterprise Henry Castro expended of his personal means over one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
He fed his colonists for a year - furnished them milch cows, farming implements, seeds, medicines and whatever they needed.
He was a father, dispensing blessings hitherto unknown in the colonization of Texas He was a learned, wise and humane man, unappreciated by many, because he was modest and in nowise self-asserting, and his tastes were literary.
He was a devoted friend of Presidents Lamar, Houston and Jones, all of whom were his friends and did all in their power, each during his term, to advance his great and patriotic idea of planting permanent civilization in South-west Texas.
He was a devout believer in the capacity of intelligent men for self-government, and abhorred despotism as illustrated in the kingly governments of Europe-the rule of nations by succession in particular families regardless of sense, honor or capacity.
He believed with Jefferson, in the God-given right of every association of men, whether in commonwealth, nations or empires, to select their own officers, and, by chosen representatives, to make their own laws.
Hence he was, in every sense, a valuable accession to the infant Republic of Texas.
When war raged and our ports were closed, Mr. Castro sought to visit the land of his birth, and, to that end, reached Monterey in Mexico.
There he sickened and died, and there, at the base of the Sierra Madre, his remains repose.
Excerpt from "Indian Wars and Pioneers of Texas"
HENRI CASTRO (1786–1865).
Henri Castro, empresario and founder of Castro's colony, was born in the department of Landes, France, in July 1786.
His family, descended from Portuguese Jews who had fled to France after the inception of the Spanish Inquisition, occupied a position of wealth and status in southwestern France.
At nineteen Castro was appointed by the governor of Landes to a committee to welcome Napoleon during a visit to the province, and in 1806 he served as a member of Napoleon's guard of honor when the emperor installed his brother Joseph as king of Spain.
In 1813 Castro married a wealthy widow, Amelia Mathias, who brought him a dowry of 50,000 francs.
After the fall of Napoleon, he immigrated to the United States and in 1827 became a naturalized citizen.
He returned to France in 1838 and became a partner in the banking house of Lafitte and Company.
While with that firm he was active in trying to negotiate a loan for the Republic of Texas and thus became interested in the young republic.
Out of gratitude for his influence and kindness to Texas, President Sam Houston appointed him consul general for Texas at Paris.
In 1842 Castro entered into a contract with the Texas government to settle a colony in Southwest Texas on the Medina River.
After great expense, labor, and vexing delays, between 1843 and 1847 he succeeded in chartering twenty-seven ships, in which he brought to Texas 485 families and 457 single men.
His task was made difficult because at this same time the French government was trying to colonize Algeria and because the Mexican War made Texas ports often unsafe harbors for the landing of immigrants.
Castro was able, however, to settle his first shipload of families at Castroville in September 1844; in 1845 he established the village of Quihi; in 1846, the town of Vandenburg; the last village, D'Hanis, was founded in 1847.
Castro was a learned, wise, humane man.
In the management of his colony he is more comparable to Stephen F. Austin than is any other Texas empresario.
He expended his own money freely-more than $200,000-for the welfare of his colonists, furnishing them cows, farm implements, seeds for planting, medicines, and whatever they really needed that he was able to procure for them.
He had unbounded faith in the capacity of intelligent men for self-government.
Among his duties Castro found the time to publish his memoirs.
He made many maps of his colonial grant and of the area bordering on it and circulated them throughout the Rhine districts of France to induce colonists to join his settlements.
These maps did much to advertise Texas in Europe.
Despite his scholarship, his exceedingly great energy, and his rare aptitude for work, he was exceptionally modest and retiring.
While on his way to France in 1865, he became severely ill at Monterrey, Nuevo León, and died there on November 31, 1865.
He was buried in Monterrey at the foot of the Sierra Madre.
His many interests were carried on by his son, Lorenzo.
Castro County, in the Panhandle, was named in his honor.

Mabel Doss Day and daughter
Fence-cutting war reaches Mabel Day's ranch
On this day in 1883, free-grass cattle raisers began cutting the fences of Mabel Doss Day's ranch, the first fully fenced large ranch in Texas.
She inherited the 85,000-acre, debt-ridden spread in Coleman County when her husband of 2 1/2 years, William H. Day, died from injuries received when his horse fell during a stampede.
With the absence of any laws governing building or cutting fences, free-grass cattle raisers, long accustomed to an open range, responded to the summer drought by cutting the fences of the ranchers who had bought and fenced their land.
Mabel Day responded to this threat to her ranch by lobbying in Austin for a law making fence cutting a felony; the law was passed in 1884.
The fence-cutting war subsided, leaving her with miles of fence to repair.
Even after her second marriage, she continued to own and operate the ranch and reduce her debt until, at her death in 1906, she was able to leave a debt-free portion of the ranch to her daughter.

She was born in Brunswick, Missouri, on July 4, 1854, to Frances Pope (Monroe) of Richmond, Virginia (a grandniece of President James Monroe), and John Doss, a native of Kentucky and a Missouri river merchant.
In 1872 Mabel Doss graduated with honors from Hocker Female College in Lexington, Kentucky.
Her first job was teaching school in Prairie Home, Missouri, but in 1873 she moved with her brother, John Doss, to Sherman, Texas, to organize a music class.
There she met William H. Day of Austin, whom she married in Sherman on January 26, 1879.
The couple had one child, a daughter, born on December 19, 1880, and named Willie Mabel Day, after both parents.
The spring after their marriage the couple moved to a ranch of about 85,000 acres in Coleman County.
Writing to a friend in Lexington, Kentucky, Mabel Doss Day reported that her husband was building a fence around his pasture, which when completed would enclose 40,000 acres of land.
She rode with him, starting early in the morning and not getting back until nearly dark, supervising the twenty men working on the fence.
She had one neighbor, a Mrs. Gatlin, who lived seven miles away.
It was eleven miles from the house to the far side of the pasture, and Coleman City was twenty-five miles north.
On June 14, 1881, Day died from injuries received when his horse fell during a stampede.
He died intestate, leaving a large but encumbered inheritance.
The debts included sections in the Day pasture which were not paid for, as well as claims of other cattlemen against the estate.
Mabel Doss Day took over a debt-ridden ranch, which she reorganized as the Day Cattle Ranch Company.
Widowed, with a six-month-old daughter, about 78,000 acres under fence, and more than $117,000 in debt, Mabel Doss Day had to contend with creditors and her husband's business associates.
She organized a $200,000 cattle corporation by selling a half-interest in her cattle to investors in Kentucky.
She retained full title to all of her land and full management of the ranch.
By 1883 the Day Cattle Ranch was the largest fenced ranch in Texas.
As Mabel was closing the deal with the Kentucky investors, the fence cutting war of 1883 broke out.
In September 1883 she wrote to her friend Col. J. M. Booth that her fence was being cut to pieces on the south side.
With the absence of any laws governing building or cutting fences, free-grass cattle raisers, long accustomed to an open range, responded to the summer drought by cutting the fences of the ranchers who had bought and fenced their land.
On September 13, shortly before rains broke the summer drought, the Austin Weekly Statesman reported that wire cutting had commenced in Coleman County, including the ranch of Mrs. Mabel Day, a courageous widow.
Mabel Doss Day responded to this threat to her ranch by lobbying in Austin for a law making fence cutting a felony; the law was passed in 1884.
The fence cutting war subsided, leaving her with miles of fence to repair.
She also owed final payments to the state for lands in the Day pasture.
Though she had eliminated her most pressing obligations and had reduced debt on the ranch, she still continued to fight to retain the ranch.
On April 28, 1889, she married Capt. J. C. Lea of Roswell, New Mexico.
She moved to New Mexico, and while there established a church and a school, the New Mexico Military Institute.
She also made frequent trips back to Texas to manage the Day Ranch.
Appointed lady commissioner to the World's Fair of 1904 in St. Louis, she was active in efforts to move additional settlers to Texas.
She settled 500 people on her ranch in Coleman County, founding schools and churches and further reducing the debt on her ranch.
On April 4, 1906, Mabel Doss Day Lea died at St. Paul's Hospital in Dallas after an operation.
At the time of her death, she had set aside debt-free land for her daughter.
The ranch included more than 10,000 acres in 1981.
In macrocosm, cattle financing formed a well-structured pattern.
In microcosm, the individual solutions reveal an imaginativeness that defies compartmentalization.
The financial histories of three firms, the Lea Cattle Company, the Day Cattle Company, and the Lance Creek Company, illustrate a few of the highly original responses which cattlemen made to the challenges of cattle financing.
Captain Joseph Calloway Lea
Captain Joseph Calloway Lea, known throughout New Mexico as the father of Roswell, had a most interesting life.
He was born in Cleveland, Tennessee, on November 8, 1841.
His father, Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, was also a native of Tennessee, of Virginia ancestry.
The Captain's mother, Lucinda Calloway Lea, was from the North and of Yankee background.
The Leas are descendants of one of three brothers who came from England to America in the early days.
The orthography of the name was changed, one branch using the spelling Leigh another Lee, and the one from which the Captain is descended, Lea.
In 1847 Dr. Lea moved with his wife, seven children and slaves to Jackson County, Missouri, where he became the owner of a fine farm, containing about 1000 acres.
He was one of the first settlers to make his home on the Kansas border on the high land back from the unhealthful Missouri River.
There he farmed and practiced medicine.
The town of Lee's Summit was named for him, but in later years the Missouri Pacific Railroad twisted the name and the spelling was never corrected.
Joe Lea, the one we are discussing, attended the neighborhood school, with his four brothers and two sisters and his three cousins, Cole, Bob and Jim Younger, who lived on an adjoining farm.
Joe Lea had finished the common school course before he and his brothers, Tom, Frank and Alf, went across the plains to Colorado, in 1860.
On this trip he was in charge of a large train of freight wagons.
It was quite a trying experience for a young man of nineteen, as it was his first business venture and the Indians were numerous along the route.
In Colorado he engaged in freighting, lumbering and prospecting.
His life was not at all monotonous, for the many Arapahoes and Cheyennes in that country seemed to take a great interest in prospectors and miners.
While in that country he visited Denver and Boulder, which were then mere shanty towns.
Finally he settled on a ranch, where he remained until he was called home because of the death of his father, in the spring of 1862.
During Joe Lea's two years absence from home, old factional animosities between the abolitionists of Kansas and the slave holders in Missouri had burst into a bloody sectional border war.
Jayhawkers and Redlegs from Jim Lane's army of Lawrence, Kansas, viciously attacked the settlements in western Missouri, raiding and looting, carrying off negroes and stock, burning farm homes, and even hanging and killing old men.
With the Missourians retaliating in kind, conditions around Lee's Summit had so deteriorated that Mrs. Lea and her two daughters had long since left Missouri for the safety of her parent's home in the North.
Dr. Lea's life then became almost intolerable.
Until the Civil War had cleft Missouri into two factions, Dr. Lea, a prominent physician of the community, was held in high esteem by all.
The fact that Mrs. Lea was a Yankee made him suspect among the Southern sympathizers of that section, and because of his birth and being a slave holder he was Southern to all others.
On night, in the spring of 1862, a band of Kansas Redlegs appeared at his front gate, ostensibly to ask road directions.
They called for him to come out; and as he stepped through the door, they shot him down without provocation, killed the only slave remaining on the place, and left the house in flames, after looting all the furniture.
In spite of what they found on their return from Colorado, Frank and Joe Lea, who were then eighteen and twenty years respectively, hoped to remain neutral.
But it was impossible to do so, because the Northern sympathizers in that part of the country regarded them as Rebels.
One day, as the two Lea boys were gathering corn in their father's field, a squad of Kansas border soldiers came along and arrested them.
The next day they found themselves being lined up with eighteen others before a firing squad.
They recognized the officer in charge as a boyhood friend.
When he stepped in front of them he whispered, "You both duck and run like hell."
In the confusion that followed, the Lea boys escaped.
They soon found refuge in Quantrill's guerilla band.
There they were welcomed by many neighborhood friends, including John Jarrette, Frank James and their three cousins, Cole, Bob and Jim Younger.
They had all seen homes burned and close kin murdered by outlaw bands of Kansas Jayhawkers.
Soon, Joe Lea's every passion became subservient to that of revenge.
He quickly completed the school of the bushwhacker and evolved a seasoned guerilla fighter; and under Quantrill, the greatest of all guerilla chieftains, he became a fearless leader of bushmen.
He possessed extraordinary resources and cunning.
From Quantrill he learned to count the cost of everything, figure the odds, retreat often rather than fight and be worsted, but always to strike back with fury, fight desparately and kill everything.
In 1863 Quantrill with 448 men retaliated against excesses committed by the Kansas forces by burning 185 buildings and killing 140 people of Lawrence, Kansas.
Because 6000 Federal Troops were hot on his trail, he disbanded his guerillas for the winter and retired behind the Confederate lines into Louisiana, with 150 of his men.
General Kirby Smith, commanding the Rebel army in Louisiana, soon notified the guerilla band that they could not join his army, nor would they be allowed to remain in Louisiana.
Quantrill withdrew into Texas and set up winter camp on Mineral Creek, some fifteen miles northwest of the town of Sherman.
At this camp dissension arose and the disintegration of the guerilla band began.
The headquarters of the Louisiana state government was then at Shreveport and Henry W. Allen was the chief executive.
He heard of Kirby Smith's refusal to allow the men of Quantrill's command to become soldiers in the regular army or remain in the state and he sent for them himself and requested they join the state scouting service and be under his immediate control.
Quantrill declined the invitation, but a number of his followers, among them John Jarette, Frank and Jesse James and the Younger Brothers, accepted the offer of Governor Allen.
This group elected as their captain one of their number, Joseph C. Lea.
Captain Lea was a young man as desperate as any.
He knew nothing of fear and had been in many a close encounter on the Kansas border.
He was a powerful man, well over six feet tall, built from the ground up, had a wild dashing air that always distinguished him in any company, and had a face altogether more pleasing than disagreeable.
The place of rendezvous for this company of state scouts was Carroll Parish, about twenty-five miles from the Mississippi River, directly across from Vicksburg.
Before the war this country had been in a high state of cultivation, but the neglect of the river levees had made it subject to inundations.
For many miles in every direction much of the land was covered with water a great portion of the year.
A good class of people lived there.
Many of them had been wealthy planters and the owners of a large number of slaves.
It was one of the richest portions of the state, being in the center of the great cotton belt of the South.
Captain Lea and his followers had no trouble finding friends and abettors, and that too, among the most respectable people of the community.
There were two little towns in the parish, Floyd and Delhi.
At these two hamlets and in their vicinity the guerillas made their homes.
They came and went without let or hindrance, and were always full of money.
Joe Lea, Frank and Jesse James and John Jarrett stopped with a planter named Dickson.
He, above all others of the parish, was confidential friend of the guerillas.
They were all active, well built men, of that dashing, reckless air that captures the hearts of women.
They kept the community in a state of perpetual excitement and enthusiasm.
They made sad havoc among wives and maidens.
While Lea's men were resting between forays, it was one round of revelry.
Every night there was a party or ball at the house of some planter.
The guerillas were the lions of all these occasions.
They sported the most gaudy dress, flourished the finest pistols and rode the finest horses.
They were the only heroes the people there could have with them.
To the negroes they were a terror.
In fact, they were supreme in the mastery of Carroll Parish.
As was the fashion with the Missouri guerillas, they dressed in Federal uniforms whenever they were on one of their frequent raids behind the enemy lines.
By waylaying Federal supply trains and couriers servicing front line troops, they kept the lines of communication and supply in a constant state of fear and turmoil.
The Yankees could not tell friend from foe, and thus disguised Lea and his raiders decoyed hundreds of Yankee soldiers into the jaws of death.
They would completely wipe out the enemy, taking his money and horses.
They kept on hand at all times a large supply of government mules, harness, wagons and various sorts of military supplies.
There was no quarter given and certain death if captured.
Captain Lea was well known to the Union army operating in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee, and was the subject of frequent Federal dispatches between the General Headquarters of New Orleans and Memphis.
The first message to be found of record was dispatched to General Davis who was then occupying Morgan's Ferry, Louisiana.

Morganza, La.
October 20, 1864
. . . . I am informed that a Captain Lee, with 100 men of Quantrill's band, dressed in Federal uniforms, has made application to the officer commanding confederate forces at Simsport [La.] to be permitted to cross to this side of the Atchafalaya.
He refused permission and threatened to fire on them in case they should attempt to cross, as General Smith and the Confederate authorities regard them as outlaws.
If you capture any of these men and trouble the commissary for rations for them I shall certainly quarrel with you.
M. K. Lawler
Brig. Gen., Commanding
That following day General Lawler sent a similar message to General Headquarters at New Orleans warning that Captain Lea might strike the river lower down.
But Lea, who possessed the same extraordinary resources and cunning of his former leader, did not turn up where the enemy most suspected.
He had learned to travel a multitude of long roads rather than a short one once too often.
He was next reported across the Mississippi River deep behind the enemy lines northeast of Vicksburg.

. . . . Captain Lee (guerilla) was at Trinity, on Black River with 500 men, mostly deserters from Harrison's Brigade, and paroled prisoners. . . .
A.M. Jackson,
2nd Lt. Signal Corps, U. S. Army.
On this foray, Lea no doubt troubled the Federal commissary and made himself felt in other ways, because on December 21st Major General E. R. S. Camby, commanding at New Orleans, sent a somewhat urgent request to Major General N. J. T. Dana, at Memphis, Tennessee:
Sir: I wish you as soon as possible to organize an expedition for the purpose of driving off the guerilla and partisan bands under Harrison and Lee that now infest the upper parishes of Louisiana between the Washita and Mississippi Rivers, and desire that you will organize a force for that purpose as soon as possible.
If you need it, some cavalry can be sent to you from the Department of the Gulf.
General Reynolds will be instructed to make a demonstration from Pine Bluff [Arkansas] to distract the attention of the rebels from your movement.
You can communicate directly with General Reynolds and arrange the time of your operation.
General Dana, commanding the Department of Mississippi with headquarters at Memphis, replied on December 28th.
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the cipher dispatch of the Major General commanding the division, dated 21st inst.
As is already known to him, all the cavalry of this command is absent, and I consider it necessary to wait its return before making the expedition spoken of, both for the force required and the officers to command it.
In my opinion, to make a thorough work, 2000 or 2500 cavalry will be required, and as that now absent will probably be well used up on its return, I ought to be supplied with 1000 effective re-enforcements.
I would recommend that that number be held in readiness for my call, but not sent here until called for, as it is better they should not ascend the river higher than the point where it is decided to rendezvous and make a landing.
I have been contemplating a movement in that district since early October, but the necessary detachments of force frm Vicksburg and Natchez to General Reynolds in that month, and the expeditions against the Mississippi Central and Mobile and Ohio Railroads have unavoidably delayed it.
I can easily drive Harrison and Lee almost anywhere, but they will immediately return on our retirement.
I will at once communicate with General Reynolds on the subject, and will notify him in full of my plans when I am ready to act. . . . .
It is hard to say whether General Dana carried out his expedition against Lea, but if he was supplied with the required cavalry it may well be assumed that he did.
If he did attempt the expedition, it did no good, because Lea, who was accustomed to being driven from the flanks of one column, only to appear in the rear of another was still in the field for two months after General Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox on April 9, 1865.
Captain Lea's value as a fearless field commander was finally recognized by General Kirby Smith who gave him a battlefield promotion to full colonel in the Confederate Army in the early months of 1854.
But to those who accompanied him on numbers of gallant charges and to his close and personal friends, he was always known affectionately as Captain Lea.
While the clouds of war were hovering over the remnants of the Confederacy, still holding out in Louisiana and Texas, General Shelby and General Kirby Smith asked Lea to go with them and make a union with Maximilian in Mexico.
But Captain Lea, who had suffered all manner of hardships, had been tried in the most trying places, and who had not cared much whether he lived or died, had seen all he wanted of war.
Unlike some of his contemporaries who had learned to live on plunder, he took off his side arms, and was never again known to wear a gun.
Thomas Calloway, a Yankee uncle, soon interceded for Captain Lea, through his personal friendship with President Andrew Johnson and secured for the Captain a full pardon for his part in the rebellion.
And from that moment on he dedicated his life to the support of law and order and good will toward his fellow man.
Lea soon left Louisiana for Georgia where he obtained a quarter interest in the contract to rebuild the Georgia and Central Railroad, which had been destroyed by Sherman on his march to the sea.
In 1867 he married Mrs. Douglas Burbridge, but her death some four years later left him a widower.
He became engaged in cotton planting in Mississippi and in 1875 he married the daughter of Major W. W. Wildy of Yazoo County.
Soon thereafter they moved to Colfax County, New Mexico, where Lea went into the sheep and cattle business and a son, Wildy, was born.
In the fall of 1877, Captain Lea with his family and entourage, consisting of employees and sheep and cattle, drifted his flocks into the Pecos Valley, and by the following year he had acquired the two adobe buildings and several hundred acres of land that comprised the town of Roswell, Lincoln County, New Mexico.
Lincoln County was the largest, most isolated and wildest county in the United States in 1877.
Although the arrival of Captain Lea happened to fall just a few days before the killing of John H. Turnstall that triggered the Lincoln County War, in which Billy The Kid figured so prominently, he refused from the start to be drawn into the feud.
He is said to have announced to both groups of belligerents that when he felt like doing any fighting, he would do it on his own hook—in the meanwhile they could settle their difficulties to suit themselves.
Such a positive declaration enabled him to preserve neutrality throughout the months of confusion and excitement of the Lincoln County War.
Captain Lea was not content with the feuding and fighting that was going on in the Lincoln section of the county and he did what he could to end the strife.
He realized that if the feud was not checked and order restored Lincoln County could never be developed.
The prospects had been dismaying, but he was of the stuff that sticks it out no matter what the difficulties.
It did not daunt him that John Chisum, who had been the mainstay of the Pecos Valley in a business way, had determined to leave for a more peaceful location.
Captain Lea's mind was fully made up to develop Roswell, his privately owned community, into what might be an example of law and order to the surrounding country, which had an utter disregard for law or life.
With the withdrawal of Chisum, he naturally assumed the position of leadership.
He sent for Billy the Kid, the most notorious outlaw of the region, and said to him in no uncertain terms, "Bonney, if I ever catch you here in Roswell cutting up any of your capers, I'll take my Winchester and fill you full of holes."
Billy the Kid laughed and replied, "All right Cap'in, I'll sure leave this place alone.
I promise you I won't cut up any capers in your Roswell."
And the Kid kept his word.
Shortly thereafter a drunken cowboy knifed a man in front of Captain Lea's store.
He was promptly arrested and brought before a Justice of the Peace, who fined him $2.50.
This is the first instance of record of law being enforced in the Pecos Valley.
During the late summer and early fall of 1878, Lincoln County was in an even more desperate plight, than when the Lincoln County War was in its most active state.
Where there had been two factions, each with some claim to acting in behalf of law and order, now appeared several aggregations of outlaws and desperate characters, roaming at will over the country and making no pretense to motives other than a selfish greed and a desire to fatten off the spoils.
The Mexican communities especially suffered at the hands of these terrorizers.
The result was that the entire country became panic stricken.
Whether it was Captain Lea's reputation that he had tried to leave behind the Yankee lines, or his warm and friendly smile that was backed up by steel gray eyes that a gunman couldn't face, the many outlaw gangs that had assumed command of southeastern New Mexico left Lea and his town strictly alone.
The outlaws and professional rustlers, however, were in full charge of the country, even to the outskirts of the Captain's little cowtown village.
They were driving off sizeable bunches of cattle, holding up the stage from Las Vegas and robbing the United States mail.
Even Captain Lea had been held up in his buckboard and had his Winchester taken from him.
Captain Lea, however, was determined to see this thing out.
He was an ambitious man with unlimited vision.
To Lea it was clear that the day was coming when Roswell would be a booming railroad town and fortunes would be made there by men of courage and imagination.
The pictures that he tried to paint were hard to visualize, because, first, there must be some semblance of peace and order.
It was Captain Lea's inducement that brought Pat Garrett into Lincoln County and got him to take up valuable land near Roswell.
This made it possible for the Roswell section to furnish the county with a useful and successful candidate for the office of sheriff.
During his term of office, Pat Garett and his deputy, John W. Poe, who succeeded him in office, shot and killed Billy the Kid and killed, captured, or ran out of Lincoln County the backbone of the lawless element.
Captain Lea's character and reputation throughout Lincoln County had made for him a host of friends.
Lea, now a county commissioner, an influential merchant at Roswell and a successful cattleman, had become practically the new boss of the county.
Leaving his store in the hands of Ash Upson, the postmaster at Roswell, he spent much of his time locating water rights and expanding his cattle business.
With the coming of the big cattle boom of the early Eighties, Lea interested H. K. Thurber in joining him in carving out a cattle empire in New Mexico.
Thurber, a wealthy New York wholesale grocer, steamship owner, and owner of the Thurber-Arbuckle Coffee Company, was a man of seemingly unlimited means.
Together they organized the Lea Cattle Company, in which Mr. Thurber invested $500,000 in cattle and put up $250,000 to secure further lands with water rights.
Under the management of Captain Lea they were running between thirty and fifty thousand cattle west of the Pecos to include the Captain Mountains and many miles to the west.
On a cattle buying trip to Texas in 1885, Captain Lea became fascinated with a young widow, who was known throughout that state as the Cattle Queen of Texas.
Mrs. Mabel Day was the only unattached woman in the entire state who ran cattle on a large spread and could talk the language of cattle kings.
She owned and operated the largest ranch ever to be put under fence in Coleman County.
Captain Lea pressed his case for four years and finally in 1889 they were married.
Mrs. Mabel Day Lea left her ranch in charge of her brother, Will Doss, and with her nine year old daughter, Willie Day, moved to Roswell.
Mrs. Lea arrived in Lincoln County at a point which might be considered the beginning of the colonization period of the Pecos Valley.
Roswell was still nothing but a cow trail with six houses on what was called main street, with about six more scattered about the prairie, with nothing but trails connecting.
However, things were beginning to develop in the Pecos Valley.
Lincoln County was still the largest and most isolated county in the United States.
It was over 200 miles from corner to corner and still contained some of the wildest of the west.
But the railroad, which had reached Pecos and El Paso, was building from the former city toward Roswell.
Some of the Captain's dreams had begun to materialize.
Charles Eddy, man of nerve and imagination, the type that Captain Lea had spoken of, had thrown up a tent city, to be later known as Carlsbad, in the path of the oncoming railroad.
He was strictly an idea man, an incurable promoter, who for the next twenty years was to be identified with men willing to pour millions of risk capital into his many irrigation, mining and railroad schemes, which eventually were to make him a millionaire.
Charles Eddy had a great respect and admiration for Captain Lea.
He confided in a letter to Mrs. Lea before her marriage:
I am confident that your life here will be a happy one, for Captain Lea is one of the best men I ever knew.
His character and reputation is excelled by none.
He is very kind hearted, liberal and generous to a fault, extremely popular and has a host of friends.
He is a large land owner in Lincoln County and stands as high as any man in the Territory among business men.
When the Leas arrived in Roswell, horse drawn graders were marking off the streets surveyed out by the Captain's brother, Alfred E. Lea, who was the founder of Steamboat Springs, Colorado.
Nothing else had happened in Roswell, but things were at a turning point.
In Bancroft's History of New Mexico, published in 1889, the only reference to Roswell was: "Roswell is regarded as the prospective site of an important agricultural center."
The magic through which this might be accomplished seemed to be irrigation.
Several irrigation companies were organized to take the waters from the mountains to the west flowing through the Hondo, but it was not until the discovery of artesian water, in January 1891, that Bancroft's predictions became a reality.
When Mrs. Lea, who was a graduate of Hocker Female College of Lexington, Kentucky, set up housekeeping in the original adobe house of Roswell, there was not a public school in operation in the entire Territory of New Mexico.
Captain and Mrs. Lea, who were absent from Roswell much of their time during the fall of 1889, looking after their separate interests, expressed a growing concern for the education of their three children, Willie Day, Wildy and Ella Lea.
During the Christmas holidays of 1890, Mrs. Lea persuaded Colonel Robert S. Goss, Commandant of Cadets of Fort Worth University, to come to Roswell to look over the prospects or organizing a military school there, with the idea in mind of providing some form of adequate schooling for the Territory.
After much persuasion and financial backing of Captain Lea and other interested parties in Roswell and the surrounding territory, Colonel Goss started Goss Military Institute in the other original adobe house in Roswell on September 3, 1891.
This was the beginning of what is now New Mexico Military Institute.
This school became one of Captain Lea's obsessions and he was continued as regent of the school until his death.
Captain Lea's ambition for Roswell as a great railroad point was finally reached on October 10, 1894, when with great celebration the train arrived there.
Southeastern New Mexico during this period had experienced a phenomenal growth.
Captain Lea, who had "led the home builders to Roswell" had seen hundreds of families settle in the Pecos Valley to take up newly developed irrigated farm lands.
Up until 1898 Captain Lea and the other eighteen cow outfits that were running over thirty thousand head, plus countless other smaller operators up and down the Pecos Valley, had survived their ups and downs.
But in that year something happened that is still known as the big "die out" along the Pecos River.
Everybody was wiped out by blizzard and drouth.
H. K. Thurber's cattle empire folded with the drouth and the accompanying money panic.
Captain Lea's empire collapsed with that of H. K. Thurber and he withdrew, as he had done many times under Yankee attack, this time to the bounds of his original holdings at Roswell.
These would yet make him rich, so thought the Captain.
With the repeated efforts of the Hondo irrigation project and the artesian discoveries, to put the Pecos Valley under water, Roswell and its territory continued to grow.
The settlers that continued to flow into the Pecos Valley were of Anglo-Saxon origin and a good class of people that were to develop a culture of their own.
By 1990 Roswell was boasting a population of 2000 and felt itself ready to become a city.
In 1903 it assumed the status of a municipality and held its first city election.
The Father of Roswell, Captain J. C. Lea, was elected mayor.
In his only campaign speech he said, "I would rather be elected the mayor of Roswell, than be the governor of New Mexico."
The people of Roswell still love Captain Lea.
A county was named for him.
At New Mexico Military Institute they have a Lea Hall.
And though when Captain Lea died in 1904, he only had one dollar in the bank, because his banker would not let him over draw, he still owned the town of Roswell and still resides there in the memories of many people.

FENCE CUTTING.
Fence cutting in Texas in the summer and fall of 1883 was a part of the conflict between landless cattlemen who wanted to retain practices of the open range and those who bought barbed wire to fence the land to establish themselves on permanent ranches.
The fence war was precipitated by the drought of 1883, which made it all the harder for the cowman without land of his own to find the grass and water necessary for his herds.
Most of the ranchmen owned or leased the land they fenced, but some of them enclosed public land when they enclosed their own, and others strung their wire about farms and small ranches belonging to other persons.
Often the fences blocked public roads; in some instances they cut off schools and churches and interfered with the delivery of mail.
This unwarranted fencing led some men whose land was not actually fenced in to join in the nipping.
As the cutting continued, it became less discriminate and attracted rougher elements; soon no ranchman's fence was safe.
Wrecking of fences was reported from more than half the Texas counties and was most common in a belt extending north and south through the center of the state, the ranchman's frontier of 1883.
Much of the cutting was done at night by armed bands who called themselves such names as Owls, Javelinas, or Blue Devils.
Often those who destroyed fences left warnings against rebuilding, but these were usually disregarded.
In some instances, pastures of the fencers were burned.
Some owners defended their property, and at least three men were killed in clashes between fence cutters and ranchmen.
Texas newspapers generally condemned the cutting but indicated that not all the fencers were free of blame.
Few attempts were made to reconcile the embittered groups, but at Henrietta spokesmen for the fence cutters met with Clay County ranchmen, and the two groups agreed that fences would be removed from across public roads and land not owned or leased by the fence builders, that gates would be provided for farmers' use, and that wire-cutting would end.
By the fall of 1883 damage from wrecking of fences in Texas was estimated at $20 million-at more than $1 million in Brown County alone.
The Fort Worth Gazette asserted that fence troubles had caused tax valuations to decline $30 million.
The clashes discouraged farming and scared away some prospective settlers.
Politicians shied from the explosive issue, but on October 15 Governor John Ireland called a special session of the legislature to meet on January 8, 1884.
After a deluge of petitions and heated debates, the legislature made fence cutting a felony punishable by one to five years in prison.
The penalty for malicious pasture-burning was two to five years in prison.
Fencing of public lands or lands belonging to others knowingly and without permission was made a misdemeanor, and builders of such fences were to remove them within six months.
Ranchers who built fences across public roads were required to place a gate every three miles and to keep the gates in repair.
These measures ended most of the fence troubles, although sporadic outbreaks of nipping continued for a decade, especially during droughts.
Texas Rangersqv were sent after fence cutters in Navarro County in 1888, and for several years the rangers had occasional fence cases in West Texas.

Robert Neighbors assassinated at Fort Belknap
On this day in 1859, Robert Simpson Neighbors, Indian agent, was shot and killed by Edward Cornett at Fort Belknap.
Neighbors was first appointed as an Indian agent in 1845.
As agent for the Lipan Apaches and Tonkawas, he instituted the field system of Indian control.
That is, instead of remaining at the agency headquarters and waiting for the Indians to pay him a visit, as was the common practice, Neighbors dealt with them directly in their home territory.
Later, when he was overseeing Comanches, he continued this practice, with the result that he spent much time far beyond the frontier and exercised greater influence over the Indians in Texas than any other white man of his generation.
In 1853 he was made supervising agent for the Texas Indians.
As a member of the Fourth Texas Legislature he opened the way for Indian reservations.
After receiving numerous death threats because of his attempts to protect Texas Indians, he was finally assassinated in 1859.

FORT BELKNAP.
Fort Belknap, a United States Army post three miles south of Newcastle in Young County, was founded on June 24, 1851, at the site of present Newcastle by Bvt.
Brig. Gen. William G. Belknap.
After the commanding officer, Capt. C. L. Stephenson, Fifth Infantry, found no water in shafts dug sixty-six feet deep at the location of the water tower now in Newcastle, he moved the fort two miles south, where adequate water was found in springs by the Brazos River.
The present well was dug in 1857 under the direction of Capt. Gabriel R. Paul of the Seventh Infantry.
The first buildings were jacals.
Some were later replaced with stone.
Fort Belknap was a four-company post.
Among the companies stationed there during its existence were some from the Fifth United States Infantry, the Second United States Dragoons, the Seventh United States Infantry, the Second United States Cavalry, and the Sixth United States Cavalry.
Among the commanding officers were Col. Gustavus Loomis, Maj. Enoch Steen, Captain Paul, Maj. George H. Thomas, Maj. Samuel Henry Starr, Lt. Col. Samuel Davis Sturgis, and Capt. Richard W. Johnson.
Fort Belknap was the northern anchor of a chain of forts founded to protect the Texas frontier from the Red River to the Rio Grande.
It was a post without defensive works.
From it troops pursued raiding bands of Indians, and on occasion mounted expeditions from the fort carried the war to the enemy on the plains as far north as Kansas.
The fort gave confidence to citizens, who came in such numbers that surrounding counties were organized.
Fort Belknap became the hub of a network of roads stretching in every direction; the most notable of these was the Butterfield Overland Mail route from St. Louis to San Francisco.
In early 1861, believing that war was imminent, Gen. David E. Twiggs ordered Col. William H. Emory to gather all federal troops and move them north to Fort Leavenworth.
On February 9, 1861, General Twiggs, in San Antonio, surrendered all United States forts and military equipment in Texas.
Although it was abandoned before the Civil War, the fort was occupied from time to time by state troops of the Frontier Regiment under Col. James M. Norris.
Major Starr, with troops of the Sixth United States Cavalry, reoccupied Fort Belknap on April 28, 1867.
When Fort Griffin was founded in Shackelford County, Fort Belknap was abandoned for the last time, in September of 1867.
During the Texas Centennial, Senator Benjamin G. Oneal and local citizens restored and rebuilt some of the buildings.
During the 1970s the Fort Belknap Archives, with some assistance from the Young County Commissioners Court, rebuilt Infantry Quarters Number Four to house the records of North Texas.
Since its restoration Fort Belknap has become a cultural and recreational center.
Senator Oneal and others organized the Fort Belknap Society to supervise the maintenance of the fort.
The Young County Commissioners Court supports it financially.
Professional and learned societies, as well as family groups, use the facilities, and around 30,000 visitors register their attendance annually.
ROBERT SIMPSON NEIGHBORS (1815–1859).
Robert Simpson Neighbors, Indian agent and legislator, was born in Charlotte County, Virginia, on November 3, 1815, the son of William and Elizabeth (Elam) Neighbours.
He later dropped the u from his last name.
He was left an orphan at four months of age and was educated by private tutors hired by his guardian, Samuel Hamner, a planter.
He left Virginia at the age of nineteen, sojourned for a time in Louisiana, and arrived in Texas in the spring of 1836.
From 1839 to 1841, with the rank of lieutenant and later of captain, he was assistant quartermaster and acting quartermaster of the Texas army.
On September 11, 1842, as a member of John C. Hays's company of volunteers, Neighbors was in San Antonio attending court.
With about forty other persons, including the officers of the court, he was made prisoner by Gen. Adrián Woll and taken to Mexico.
Neighbors was released on March 24, 1844, and returned to Texas.
Early the next year he began his service as Indian agent of Texas.
As agent for the Lipan Apaches and Tonkawas, he instituted the field system of Indian control; instead of remaining at the agency headquarters and waiting for the Indians to pay him a visit, as was the common practice, Neighbors dealt with them directly in their home territory.
Later, when he was overseeing Comanches, he continued this practice, with the result that he spent much time far beyond the frontier and exercised greater influence over the Indians in Texas than any other white man of his generation.
After annexation he received a federal appointment as special Indian agent, on March 20, 1847.
He took part in several councils, including one between commissioners of the United States and the Texas Comanches near the site of Waco in 1846 and one between the Comanches and the German colonists on the San Saba River in March 1847 .
Since Neighbors was a Democrat, his services as Indian agent were terminated by the national Whig administration in September 1849, but he remained in public life.
As Texas commissioner, sent by Governor Peter Hansborough Bell, he organized El Paso County in February and March 1850 and tried, without success, to organize counties in New Mexico.
As a member of the Fourth Texas Legislature from 1851 to 1853, he successfully sponsored a law that opened the way for establishing Indian reservations.
He was a presidential elector in 1852, and shortly after the election of Franklin Pierce he was again appointed Indian agent.
In 1853 he was made supervising agent for the Texas Indians.
In 1854 he joined Capt. Randolph B. Marcy of the United States Army to make extensive explorations in Northwest Texas in search of sites for Indian reservations.
The Penateka Comanches were located on a reservation in what is now Throckmorton County, and the lesser Texas tribes at another site now in Young County .
Neighbors alleged that the United States Army officers located at the neighboring posts of Fort Belknap and Camp Cooper failed to give adequate support to him and his resident agents.
The unsympathetic attitude of the military aroused the hostility of many frontier civilians, who charged that the Indians of the reservations were committing depredations on the white settlements.
In spite of threats of lawless characters to take his life, Neighbors never faltered in his determination to protect the Indians.
With the aid of federal troops he managed to hold back the white people from the reservations, and in August 1859 he eventually succeeded in moving the Indians without loss of life to a new reservation in Indian Territory.
On his return he stopped at the village of Fort Belknap.
There on September 14, 1859, while he was engaged in conversation with another man, one Edward Cornett shot and killed him.
Neighbors probably was not even acquainted with his assassin.
He was buried in the civilian cemetery at Fort Belknap.
He was a Methodist, a Mason, and a temperance leader.
He married Elizabeth Ann Mays in Seguin on July 15, 1851, and their home was in San Antonio.
Two sons survived childhood.
INDIAN RELATIONS.
The history of relations between the numerous groups of Indians and the trans-Atlantic newcomers who started arriving in the sixteenth century and eventually came to dominate Texas is long and complex.
On the Indian side, the story is one of accommodation, resistance, and, ultimately, near-total eradication.
On the side of the Europeans and, later, the Americans, the salient features range from well-meant attempts to Christianize the Indians and educate them in such accomplishments as reading and writing, to deliberate attempts to annihilate or exile them.
Between these extremes lie many unintended consequences, such as epidemic diseases (which were passed in both directions), as well as many attitudes that lie outside the often-noted arena of violence and fanaticism, such as attempts to set aside land for the displaced.
Spanish period.
The earliest recorded contact between Europeans and Texas Indians came in November 1528, when members of Pánfilo de Narváez's expedition landed near Galveston Island and encountered people who were probably Atakapas.
One member of the expedition, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, who spent more than six years traveling through coastal Indians of South Texas, penned vivid descriptions of the hunting and gathering groups that he encountered.
Unlike many later observers, Cabeza de Vaca was not entirely disdainful of the Indians' culture, although his observations indicate their primitive lives.
Later Spaniards often condemned the backwardness of Indian cultures.
The Indians similarly must have found their encounter with people so different from them both bewildering and terrifying, and this lack of understanding and a distrust that grew on both sides often had catastrophic results.
Francisco Vázquez de Coronado traversed the northern plains while searching for Quivira in 1541, and Luis de Moscoso Alvarado reached the headwaters of the Trinity in 1542.
But except for brief incursions into West Texas, such as those by Agustín Rodríguez in 1581, Antonio de Espejo in 1582, Gaspar Castaño de Sosa in 1590, Juan de Oñate in 1601, Hernán Martín and Diego del Castilloqqv in 1650, and Diego de Guadalajara in 1654, the Spanish presence in Texas was only sporadic.
These expeditions of New Spain touched the Indians briefly and then passed on.
With the exception of a few pearls on the Concho River, Texas had no treasure to compare with the gold of Mexico, there was no cry at the time for land, and only the faith of the Spanish priests held together Spain's nebulous scheme of empire in Texas.
That is, until the French under René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, founded Fort St. Louis near Matagorda Bay in 1685.
That unsuccessful venture awoke the Spanish to both their secular and religious goals in Texas.
A brief flurry of mission building in East Texas followed.
San Francisco de los Tejas and Santísimo Nombre de María were both established in 1690.
Beginning in 1716, another period of missionary activity opened in East Texas with the establishment there of Nuestro Padre San Francisco de los Tejas, Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de los Nacogdoches, Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de los Ais, Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de los Hainais (later Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña) San José de los Nazonis, and San Miguel de Linares de los Adaes.
In 1718, on the San Antonio River, San Antonio de Valero Mission was founded, and in 1720 San José y San Miguel de Aguayo was established a short distance away.
In 1731 three of the East Texas missions were moved to the San Antonio River and renamed Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña, San Juan Capistrano, and San Francisco de la Espada.
Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga Mission was founded at La Bahía in 1722, moved to the Guadalupe River in 1726, and relocated at the site of present Goliad in 1749.
Farther westward three missions were established on the San Gabriel River: San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas in 1748, San Ildefonso, and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria in 1749 (see SAN GABRIEL MISSIONS).
In 1754 Nuestra Señora del Rosario Mission was located about four miles west of Goliad.
In 1756 Nuestra Señora de la Luz Mission was established on the lower Trinity, and the following year Santa Cruz de San Sabá Mission was built on the San Saba River.
In 1762, San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz Mission and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria del Cañón Mission were established on the upper Nueces River about halfway between Santa Cruz de San Sabá in west central Texas and San Juan Bautista in Mexico.
In 1791 the last of the Texas missions, Nuestra Señora del Refugio, was established at the junction of the Guadalupe and San Antonio rivers.
The primary goal of the missionaries was to Christianize the Indians and make them loyal subjects of the crown.
The natives of the San Antonio area, who came from groups inhabiting the region between San Antonio and the Gulf Coast, proved to be the most compliant, and they were converted in large numbers.
Other attempts, however, were less successful.
The Franciscan' harsh discipline and insistence that converts follow a rigid routine sometimes brought resistance.
For many, the Spanish were foreigners who represented a threat to traditional life, and a number of groups, such as the Karankawas and the nomads of the plains, resisted the missionary efforts.
Among those who cooperated with the Spanish, many succumbed to European diseases or became the victims of other, hostile Indians.
Those who survived gradually assimilated and intermarried with Europeans, thus forming a basis of mestizo and later Tejano culture.
The Lipan Apaches, a western Texas group, were generally hostile to the Spaniards, but when pressed by the Comanches, they asked for protection.
In 1749, the Spaniards negotiated a general treaty of peace with the Lipans, one of the earliest on record, and in the spring of 1757 established Santa Cruz de San Sabá Mission, near the site of present Menard, for these Indians.
On March 16, 1758, about 2,000 Comanches and their allies attacked the mission, destroyed it, and killed eight people.
A year later the Comanches took the presidial horse herd, a prize of more than 700 horses and mules.
Allied with the Comanches in these attacks were various northern tribes, among them Wichitas, Taovayas, Tonkawas, Bidais, and Tejas.
In the summer of 1759, in order to punish these Indians, Col. Diego Ortiz Parrilla led a force of 600 soldiers, Apache allies, and mission Indians against a combined force of Taovayas and Comanches at Spanish Fort on the Red River near the site of present Nocona, in Montague County.
From within a fort that flew a French flag, the Indians mounted a counterattack and inflicted a humiliating defeat upon Ortiz's troops, capturing their cannons and forcing them to retreat to San Sabá.
After the missions and the presidios on the San Saba and San Gabriel rivers failed, Spain turned to the French for aid and appointed Athanase de Mézières governor of the Natchitoches district.
Mézières, an experienced Indian agent and diplomat, held conferences with the tribes on the Red River and in 1771 made treaties with the Kichais, Tawakonis, and Taovayas.
In 1772 a reorganization of the Spanish holdings in Texas was ordered.
The entire territory east and northeast of San Antonio and La Bahía was abandoned, the missions and presidios were evacuated, and most Spanish settlers were taken to San Antonio.
Aware of the ever-present threat of the Indians whom the missions had failed to reach, the Spanish, with a Frenchman negotiating, made a treaty with the Yamparikas or western Comanches at the Taovaya village on the Red River (1774).
But south of this group lived the Kosoteka and Penateka bands, unaffected by the treaty, who continued their raids on the San Antonio establishments.
In 1785, attempting to correct this error in treaty making, the Spaniards concluded a formal peace treaty with the two southern Comanche bands.
In 1786 they made still another treaty with other western bands in order to permit travel through the vast Comanche plains.
Four years later the Comanches, Taovayas, Wichitas, and Tawakonis were united into a supplementary fighting force by Juan de Ugalde and employed in his defeat of the Apaches.
Although these agreements furnished some relief to the hard-pressed Spaniards, raids by both Comanches and Apaches continued until the end of Spanish rule in Texas.
This end was hastened by the issuance of a decree in 1794 that ordered the secularization of all missions in existence for more than ten years.
When carried out, secularization meant that Texas missions passed under the control of diocesan clergy and the Spanish government, and mission Indians became tax-paying citizens.
Republics of Mexico and Texas.
After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Spain planned to impede the entrance into Texas of American traders and colonists by settling on the eastern frontier certain southeastern Indian tribes, including the Choctaws, Cherokees, Alabamas, and Coushattas, who were given lands between the Sabine and Trinity rivers.
This arrangement lasted until 1821, when Texas passed under the control of the Republic of Mexico.
Stephen F. Austin and other American colonizers in Texas found a ready-made Indian problem awaiting them.
They first had to consider the more civilized tribes who wanted land, and then they were faced with the fury of the wilder tribes who resisted European incursion.
The population of Texas in 1821—3,500 white settlers and 20,000 Indians—suggested a conciliatory policy.
It was the intention of both the Mexican national government and the state of Coahuila and Texas to award land titles to the civilized tribes.
On December 24, 1824, the Shawnee Indians were awarded one square mile of land for each warrior.
The Cherokees were less fortunate—toward their dream of making East Texas a Cherokee country they received nothing but promises.
Therefore, when Benjamin Edwards was planning his abortive Fredonian Rebellion, he found the Cherokee chiefs John Dunn Hunter and Richard Fieldsqqv agreeable to his plan of dividing Texas between themselves and white men.
The tribe repudiated the plan, however, and executed the leaders, but they never received the land titles they desired, in spite of their loyalty to Mexico then and to the Americans later.
They pursued a will-of-the-wisp until they were driven from Texas in 1839.
Upon Austin and his colonists fell the burden of protection against the hostile Indians, since Mexico offered no official assistance.
Toward this end the settlers organized militia and made treaties.
In 1823 Austin led an expedition against the Karankawas and reached an agreement with them that they would not move east of the San Antonio and Guadalupe rivers.
In 1824 military threats by whites led to a treaty with the Tonkawas, Karankawas, Wacos, and Tawakonis, which lessened the immediate danger from those groups.
On the west, however, loomed the threat of the Comanches, who were waging war against the scattered and unprotected settlements and capturing horses and cattle to trade in the United States.
The four conventions of Texas colonists (the Convention of 1832, Convention of 1833, Consultation, and Convention of 1836qqv) had perforce to take note of the two desiderata in the Indian question: peace with the nearby tribes and protection from those on the western frontier.
The treaty with the Cherokees and their associate bands on February 23, 1836, sought to provide peace, and the establishment of a border ranger force was designed to provide protection.
After the battle of San Jacinto the military and political crisis of Texas had passed; the ad interim government under President David G. Burnet sought merely to tide over the Indian problem until the officers of the Republic of Texas should take their places on October 22, 1836.
The agent who was to deal with the Indians was instructed to secure their neutrality but to avoid entering into any specific treaty relating to boundaries.
The fact that Burnet held lands in conflict with the Cherokee claims may have influenced his cautious attitude.
Meanwhile, the Indians were becoming restless; an engagement between them and a ranger force took place on the San Gabriel River in the summer, and on May 19, 1836, the northern Comanches and their Kiowa allies raided Fort Parker, killed several persons, and took away five captives, one of whom was Cynthia Ann Parker.
The Cherokees and associated groups were also feeling restless because their land titles had not been ratified, Mexican agents were still active among them, and white settlers were advancing into their territory.
President Sam Houston's Indian policy of peace, friendship, and commerce, plus adequate frontier protection, was well set forth in a law of December 5, 1836, in which Houston was given power to send agents among the Indians, to make treaties and distribute presents, to establish blockhouses, forts, and trading posts, to provide for a battalion of mounted riflemen to guard the frontier, and to call out the militia if necessary.
His problem was complicated by the constant arrival of United States Indians, by the influence of Mexican agents, by private land companies that extended their surveys into Indian country, and by the mutual antagonisms of race between whites and Indians.
As for the Plains Indians, he recognized their superiority in horsemanship and knowledge of the region and preferred to deal with them by establishing trading posts on the frontier rather than by sending untrained troops against them.
On July 1, 1835, the Caddo Indians in Louisiana had made a treaty with the United States to relinquish their lands in that area and to move outside the boundaries of the United States and never return.
In 1837 Houston vainly protested this action, saying that the Caddos were thus being thrown upon Texas and asking the United States government to supply troops to restrain them.
In April 1838 the Choctaws from near Fort Towson in the Indian Territory clashed with white settlers south of the Red River, and in that summer the Cherokees and other East Texas Indians, allied with Mexican agents under Vicente Córdova, took part in the Córdova Rebellion.
The Comanches were also becoming active in the west.
President Houston initiated his policy of treaty making by concluding agreements with the Tonkawas at Bexar on November 22, 1837, with the Lipan Apaches at Live Oak Point on January 8, 1838, with the Tonkawas again on April 10, 1838 (at Houston), with the Comanches at Houston on May 29, 1838, and with the Kichais, Tawakonis, Wacos, and Taovayas near the mouth of the Washita at Shawnee Village in what is now Fannin County on September 2, 1838.
Houston was genuinely sympathetic to the Indians' position in Texas.
He had been intimately associated with them and could speak a language they could all understand.
His policy was largely successful, although no completely satisfactory solution of the Indian problem was possible.
Isolated bands continued to harass the settlements, and clashes with the armed forces were inevitable.
Mirabeau B. Lamar, who followed Houston as president, had neither experience with nor sympathy for the Indians; he wanted to destroy them or drive them from Texas.
The Cherokees, he said, had no just claim to their lands, since the promises of the Mexican government had induced them to make war on the Texans.
He further held that the Cherokees should retain no tribal status, since the result would be an alien and absolute government within the bounds of the republic.
He therefore repudiated the Cherokee treaty of February 23, 1836, maintaining that it had never been ratified and that the Indians by their acts had nullified it.
Lamar's attitude was reflected by Congress in a series of four laws designed to strengthen the armed forces.
The result was the Cherokee War.
Other encounters during Lamar's administration included expeditions led by John H. Moore and W. M. Eastlandqqv against the Comanches, the Council House Fight at San Antonio, Comanche and Kiowa attacks on Victoria and Linnville (see LINNVILLE RAID OF 1840), and the Plum Creek Fight.
Two efforts at conciliation, however, served to soften Lamar's stern policy.
The first was a treaty with the Shawnees on August 2 1839, at Nacogdoches, in which the Indians agreed to leave Texas peaceably if the government would furnish supplies and transportation and pay for improvements on the Indians' land.
The Senate did not ratify this treaty.
The other conciliatory action was a law passed on January 14, 1840, providing for the surveying and awarding of two leagues each of land in East Texas for the Alabama and Coushatta Indians, as well as a strip of land thirty miles square on the frontier to which all friendly Indians should eventually be removed.
Lamar's generally severe Indian policy produced certain evident results: (1) it quelled for the time being the major Indian disturbances, although at great loss of life; (2) it opened up for settlement the valuable Cherokee land and other land in East Texas; (3) it established the principle of exterminating the hostile Indians and removing the friendly ones from the state or to reservations; (4) it extended the western frontier by military patrol and attack, thus making settlement easier and safer for white settlers; (5) it compelled the Indians to reckon with the rapidly growing power of the Republic of Texas; (6) by its very severity, it prepared the way for the return of Houston's policy of peaceful dealings with the Indians; and (7) it contributed greatly to the rapidly growing public indebtedness of Texas and to its weakened financial structure.
During Houston's first term Indian affairs cost the republic only $190,000, but Lamar's expenditures for the same purpose soared to more than $2.5 million, more than half the total cost of government during his administration.
The peace policy returned with Houston's second administration, though the work of pacification had to be redone slowly and patiently.
Houston's plan was to send responsible agents among the Indians, build frontier posts, establish trading houses to furnish supplies, and draw the tribes into councils from which he hoped treaties would result.
Among the Indians themselves grew a fresh movement for peace.
The Caddos indicated their desire to make agreements with the government of Texas, and on August 26, 1842, a treaty was concluded at the Caddo village above the Chickasaw nation, in which these friendly Indians agreed to visit some twenty hostile tribes and seek to persuade them to join in the first of a series of councils with the Texas commissioners.
The council, held in March 1843 at Tehuacana Creek, was attended by the Delaware, Caddo, Waco, Shawnee, Hainai, Anadarko, Tawakoni, Wichita, and Kichai Indians .
They agreed that all hostilities should cease between them and the white men and that they would attend a grand council with all the Texas tribes at Fort Bird on the Trinity River in September.
On August 9, a temporary treaty was also made at the Comanche encampment on the Red River with Pah-hah-yuco, a Comanche chief who agreed to visit all the Comanche bands to induce them to treat with the white men.
All hostilities were to cease until the general council.
The September council resulted in the permanent treaty of September 29, 1843, with nine groups, the Delawares, Chickasaws, Wacos, Tawakonis, Kichais, Anadarkos, Hainais, Biloxis, and Cherokees, participating.
The treaty was ratified by the Senate on January 31, 1844, and signed by Houston on February 3.
The Comanches, still smarting from events at the Council House Fight in 1840, refused to attend this meeting, as did the Wichitas.
But on October 9 at Tehuacana Creek, the Comanches finally appeared to meet Houston himself, to exchange gifts and oratory, and to sign a treaty reiterating the provisions of the one made on September 29.
On January 24, 1845, this treaty, too, was ratified by the Senate; it was signed on February 5 by President Anson Jones, who carried on Houston's policy faithfully.
Only the Wichitas remained untouched by treaty; they did not appear at the third general council, at which no treaty was made since all the groups represented were already covered by treaties.
But the patient perseverance of Houston and his commissioners was finally effective, for at the fourth and last of the general councils, on November 16, 1845, at the Torrey Trading House near the mouth of Tehuacana Creek, where all of the grand councils had been held, the Wichitas at last appeared.
Again both Indians and white men resolved their differences, and the last treaty was signed.
A few days later, a final distribution of presents was made and the Indian affairs of the Republic of Texas were officially brought to an end.
The results of Houston's Indian policies, like his purposes, were clear: (1) the substitution of a policy of peace for one of war (Congress did not pass a single act providing for offensive action against the Indians during his administrations); (2) the drawing of the Indians into councils and the making of treaties with every major group in Texas; (3) the reduction of raids and the resultant decrease in need for protection; (4) the carrying out by the Indians, generally, of the terms of their treaties, especially with reference to surrendering captives and stolen horses; (5) the establishment of trading houses and the appointment of reliable agents and commissioners; and (6) reduction of the cost of administering Indian affairs.
Indian relations in Houston's second term cost $94,092.
In Anson Jones's one-year administration they cost only $45,000.
Statehood.
Annexation to the United States continued the seemingly inexorable process by which the Indians were nearly all expelled from Texas.
Several factors made Indian relations even more confusing than they had been in the republic: (1) the federal government assumed control of the Indians while Texas retained control of the land; (2) the Indians thus had their claim to the land cut from under them—they were now federal wards on familiar soil suddenly become alien to them; (3) since the state had surrendered control of the Indians, it no longer had an official policy toward them; (4) the continued clamor for land from the Texas public, to be held as property and cultivated or otherwise used, made extermination or expulsion of the Indians, whose relation to the land was quite different, a practical necessity; (5) when Texas ceased to be a republic, the burden of frontier defense was shifted to the federal government; (6) the United States Senate refused to define clearly its relationship to Texas and vacillated in its dealing with the Indians; and (7) Texas, seeing the temporizing federal attitude, adopted new policies for Indian control on a state basis but thereby merely deepened the confusion.
The federal government sought first to profit from Sam Houston's peace policy by continuing the treaties already in force.
Accordingly, on May 15, 1846, the federal commissioners met Comanche, Waco, Wichita, and Caddo representatives at the old council grounds on Tehuacana Creek and made a treaty in which the Indians acknowledged the authority of the federal government.
In Washington on July 25, President James K. Polk, on the occasion of a visit from the chief of the Anadarkos, issued a proclamation of friendship between the United States and this group.
On March 2, 1847, in the Meusebach-Comanche Treaty, the Indians agreed to permit Germans to occupy an area of more than three million acres.
On March 20, Robert S. Neighbors was appointed special federal agent for the Texas Indians.
Governor James Pinckney Henderson attempted to reinforce the frontier line with Texas Rangersqv, and former president Burnet tried to get the federal government to acquire proprietorship over the vacant Indian lands of Texas .
The state legislature also began importuning the Congress to regulate trade and peaceful relations with the Texas Indians.
Upon the end of the Mexican War in 1848, federal troops moved to the Texas frontier and established a new line of forts extending from Fort Worth to the site of Eagle Pass.
In 1849–51 the rush of goldseekers to California brought hordes of disturbing intruders into the Indian lands, clamor for the settlement of western Texas mounted, land grants were made to the railroads, buffalo hunters intensified the slaughter of the Plains Indians' principle sustenance, and the Indians became alarmed and began raiding again.
Federal treaty makers moved rapidly.
On December 10, 1850, on Spring Creek near the San Saba River, they concluded a treaty with the Comanche, Caddo, Lipan Apache, Quapaw, Tawakoni, and Waco Indians.
This agreement was never submitted to the Senate, since it was regarded merely as a special application of the 1846 treaty.
On October 28, 1851, on the San Saba River, an agreement was drawn up between most of the leading tribes and American officials to meet in council in October, and on November 23 a second general treaty was effected.
Meanwhile, the feeling was growing that colonizing the Indians somewhere on Texas soil would be the best solution for the Indian problem.
Accordingly, in 1852 the state decided to provide land for two reservations.
A third proposed reservation, consisting of five leagues located west of the Pecos River, never materialized.
In February 1854 the legislature set aside twelve leagues, or approximately 70,000 acres, a tract that was surveyed by Maj. Robert S. Neighbors and Capt. Randolph B. Marcy.
One tract, known as the Brazos Reserve, on the Brazos River twelve miles below Fort Belknap, was for the Anadarkos, Caddos, Ionies, Kichais, Tawakonis, Tonkawas, Wacos, and other semiagricultural tribes, which totaled about 1,110 people.
The other, known as the Clear Fork Reserve, on the Clear Fork of the Brazos, was for the Penateka Comanches.
Neighbors, who was the leading Indian agent, undertook the arduous task of persuading the various tribes to enter the reservations, and by 1856, largely through his efforts, most of the Indians from the eastern half of Texas had done so (see.
Periodic raids, however, continued along the western frontier.
Between October 1857 and April 1858, critics of the reservations claimed that 500 to 800 horses were stolen and some twenty-five settlers were killed by Indian attack.
Although both white and Indian residents of the area were victims of raids by still-unsettled Indians from the plains, reservation Indians were often blamed for the problems.
In 1858 local settlers began to agitate to have the reservation Indians expelled as the only way to solve the problem.
This verdict was confirmed by George B. Erath, who, in a letter to Governor Hardin R. Runnels, argued that removal was the answer, since whether guilty or not the reserve Indians would always be blamed.
Finally, on June 11, 1859, it was announced that the state and federal governments had reached an agreement to move the reserve Indians north of the Red River into Indian Territory.
Escorted by soldiers and rangers, the 1,000 or so reservation Indians crossed the river out of Texas on September 1.
The Civil War opened a new phase in Indian activity.
Although the Confederate forces, largely through the efforts of Albert Pike, were more effective diplomatically with the Indians in the opening months of the year, the Union leaders succeeded in concluding a treaty with the Comanches on May 13, 1861, at Alamogordo, New Mexico.
The terms of the treaty were not kept by either side, however, and the Comanches were soon raiding again.
Pike induced many Indian agents to swear allegiance to the Confederacy and, on August 12, 1861, at Fort Cobb in Indian Territory concluded a treaty with the Wichitas and the Penateka band of the Comanches.
On the next day he also made a treaty with other Comanche bands so that with the exception of the Quahadis every important Comanche group was leagued with the Confederacy.
Shortly thereafter, however, a Yamparika chief and another Comanche who had signed the Confederate treaty appeared at Fort Wise, Colorado, and on September 6, 1861, entered into an agreement for peace with the Union authorities.
Thus in the winter of 1861–62 the Texas Comanches were allied in about equal numbers with the forces of both the North and the South.
On October 23, 1862, the ties joining the Comanche to the Confederacy were broken by the destruction of the Wichita agency by the Delawares and Shawnees, who were loyal to the Union forces until the end of the war.
The Comanches then overtly allied themselves with the North.
On April 6, 1863, the chiefs of the Comanches, Kiowas, Cheyennes, Apaches, and other tribes, who had been invited to Washington, signed a treaty that, though never ratified, provided the Indians with annuities.
In October 1864 the Comanches and Kiowas demonstrated their complete break with the South by a crushing attack on a Confederate outpost twelve miles west of Fort Belknap in Young County.
But the Indians were not free from federal attack; on November 26, a large encampment of Comanches and Kiowas in the future Hutchinson County was attacked and defeated by Kit (Christopher H.) Carsonqv in what is known as the first battle of Adobe Walls.
This attack evidently turned the fickle Comanches again, for in the waning days of the war they met the Southern representatives and made a final treaty with the tottering Confederacy.
Nearly all the Comanche bands, the Kiowas, and other Plains Indians were signers to this treaty.
Thus the Civil War continued the uncertain policy of the various governments toward the Indians, with these results: (1) the Indians were divided into opposing groups; (2) diminished military protection on the frontier left the way open for increased Indian raids; (3) white movement onto the western plains was slowed up greatly; and (4) the western Indians were less disposed than ever to return to reservations.
By October 18, 1865, United States commissioners were at work reconstructing their badly shattered Indian relations, for on that date, at the mouth of the Little Arkansas River, they signed a new treaty with the Comanches, Kiowas, and Apaches.
Two years later, leaders of the Kiowas, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Apaches, and all the Comanche bands except the Quahadis met federal officials in a great council at Medicine Lodge Creek, some seventy miles south of Fort Larned, Kansas.
The treaty made there set aside reservations between the Arkansas and Canadian rivers for the exclusive use of these Indians.
The army failed to enforce the provisions of the treaty, however.
Rations often were inadequate, and white outlaws who entered Indian Territory to steal Indian stock went unpunished.
There was liquor trafficking and gun running, and buffalo hunters entered the reservations.
Some Indians began raiding, and fresh tales of Indian attacks were again circulating on the frontier.
Gradually, the federal government determined upon more aggressive measures, a move reinforced by news of the Warren Wagontrain Raid in 1871.
Ranald S. Mackenzie, chosen to lead the campaign on to the Llano Estacado, initially met with little success.
The western Indians sought tenaciously to protect their rapidly diminishing buffalo-hunting grounds, particularly in the Panhandle and southward, but the desire of the white hunters for hides, horns, and sport brought an ever-increasing number of whites into the last Comanche stronghold.
On June 27, 1874, the Comanches, Cheyennes, and Kiowas, under the leadership of Quanah Parker, Lone Wolf, and the "war prophet" Isa-tai,qqv attacked a party of hunters in the second battle of Adobe Walls.
The attackers were repulsed, and the white buffalo hunters were soon on their way again into the Comanche country.
At the end of August, Gen. Nelson A. Miles, leading a strong force southward from Camp Supply in Indian Territory, encountered the Cheyennes on the Washita River, and after a week's pursuit, engaged them on the Red River, forcing them to flee into Tule Canyon.
On September 12, Maj. William R. Price, driving down along the Canadian River from New Mexico, fought and defeated the Indians between the Washita River and Sweetwater Creek, a tributary of the Red River.
In the same series of campaigns, Frank D. Baldwin charged an encampment on McClellan's Creek on November 8, 1874, and by a ruse scattered the Indians and recovered two white prisoners, Julia and Adelaide German .
Mackenzie administered another major blow to the Indian resistance when, on September 24–26, he attacked and scattered a Cheyenne village in Palo Duro and Tule canyons, capturing and shooting many of their horses.
These vigorous and unrelenting campaigns of the Red River War in 1874 spelled the doom of the Plains Indians in Texas.
With their horses and equipment lost so that hunting was impossible, and with winter impending, the leading chiefs of the warring tribes surrendered unconditionally at their agencies, except the Quahadi band of the Comanche.
But even these proud warriors had no means to face the overpowering force of men and guns that threatened them, and in June 1875 they too surrendered at Fort Sill.

September 15 in Texas History….
.
Mexico frees slaves
On this day in 1829, the Guerrero Decree, which abolished slavery throughout the Republic of Mexico except in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, was issued by President Vicente R. Guerrero.The decree reached Texas on October 16, but Ramón Músquiz, the political chief of the Department of Texas, withheld its publication because it violated colonization laws which guaranteed the settlers security for their persons and property.
The news of the decree did alarm the Texans, who petitioned Guerrero to exempt Texas from the operation of the law.
On December 2 Agustín Viesca, Mexican minister of relations, announced that no change would be made respecting the status of slavery in Texas.
Though the decree was never put into operation, it left a conviction in the minds of many Texas colonists that their interests were not safe under Mexican rule.
……Another chapter in Texas History
VICENTE RAMÓN GUERRERO (1782–1831).
Vicente Ramón Guerrero, leader of Mexican rebels against Spanish rule and president of Mexico, the son of Juan Pedro Guerrero and María Guadalupe Saldaño, was born in Textla, Mexico, on August 1, 1782.
He became the leader of guerrilla forces in the Mexican war of independence and in 1824 won the vice presidency of Mexico.
In 1828 Manuel Gómez Pedraza defeated him for the presidency, but with Pedraza's enforced resignation, Guerrero was recognized as president on April 1, 1829.
His relationship to Texas history is through the Guerrero Decree, which was regarded as a confiscation of property and so alarmed the vested interests in Mexico that it led to a revolt against him.
Anastasio Bustamante succeeded him as chief executive on January 1, 1830, and Guerrero was shot by a firing squad on February 14, 1831.
Vicente Guerrero: A study in triumph and tragedy (1782–1831)
Jim Tuck
Vicente Ramón Guerrero Saldaña was the second president of Mexico and the first to come from las clases populares (the "popular" classes), which in Spanish is a euphemism for an individual of peasant or working class background.
This circumstance of birth is important because it would have a decisive effect on both Guerrero's life and death.
Born in Tixtla, a village in the sierra that furnishes a backdrop to Acapulco, he was of obscure origins and racially mixed background.
His birth date was August 10, 1782.
When the Independence War began with Father Hidalgo's famous grito, Guerrero was working as a gunsmith in his home town.
He joined the rebellion in November 1810 and enlisted in a division that independence leader José Maria Morelos had organized to fight in the south.
Guerrero distinguished himself in the battle of Izúcar, in February 1812, and had attained the rank of lieutenant colonel when the insurgents seized Oaxaca in November of the same year.
In late 1815, following the capture and execution of Morelos, Guerrero was the only major rebel leader still at large.
This was the independence movement's darkest period, similar to Washington's ordeal at Valley Forge.
But Guerrero persevered, keeping the rebellion alive through a protracted campaign of guerrilla warfare.
As the movement began to revive, Guerrero won victories at Ajuchitán, Santa Fe, Tetela del Río, Huetamo, Tlalchapa and Cuautlotitlán, all communities in that southern region he knew so well.
In 1819 a poignant bit of personal drama took place.
Apodaca, the Spanish viceroy, had persuaded Guerrero's aged father to try and talk his son into surrender.
Tearfully, the old man wrapped his arms around his son's legs and begged him to accept the Viceroy's terms.
Turning to his men, Guerrero spoke these words: "Compañeros, this old man is my father.
He has come to offer me rewards in the name of the Spaniards.
I have always respected my father but my country comes first."
Today there is a plaque on the wall of Guerrero's house in Tixtla containing this misquotation of his actual words: "Independence and liberty -- or death!
My country comes before my father."
Failing to induce Guerrero's surrender, Apodaca sent an army against him under the command of the flamboyant and opportunistic Agustin de Iturbide.
This force left Mexico City on November 16, 1820.
Guerrero, with his tactical skills and knowledge of the terrain, got the better of Iturbide in several skirmishes.
Then Iturbide, true to his chameleon nature, took a step that would have the widest-ranging repercussions.
On January 10, 1821, he sent Guerrero a letter proposing that the two join forces and fight for Mexican independence under what he referred to as the "three guarantees": that Mexico should be an independent constitutional monarchy; that distinctions between Spaniards, creoles, mestizos and Indians be abolished; and that Catholicism should be the state religion.
With Guerrero's agreement, the Three Guarantees were proclaimed in a February 21, 1821, manifesto called the Plan de Iguala.
The two men combined their forces into what became known as the Trigarante Army ("Army of the Three Guarantees") and prepared to attack Mexico City.
Juan O'Donojú, who had succeeded Apodaca as viceroy, realized that the situation was hopeless and agreed to Mexican independence.
On September 27, 1821, the Trigarante Army marched into the capital.
On May 21, 1822, the vainglorious Iturbide proclaimed himself Emperor Agustin 1.
The coronation was sparked by a "spontaneous" demonstration on May, led by a picked band of his soldiers, that he accept an imperial crown.
Though Guerrero initially supported Iturbide's claim, by early 1823 he was in revolt against him.
Iturbide was then being undermined by an even more flamboyant adventurer, Antonio López de Santa Anna.
Santa Anna, posing as a defender of republican liberty, declared against Iturbide because the latter had deposed Congress when his reign began and replaced it with a council of handpicked advisers.
Guerrero and Nicolás Bravo, another independence leader, joined Santa Anna and forces led by Guerrero and Bravo defeated Iturbide's troops at Almalonga on January 23, 1823.
In March, seeing that the tide was turning against him, Iturbide abdicated and sailed into European exile.
At this time a definite liberal-conservative split was developing in Mexican politics.
The liberals were known as federalists and the conservatives (who favored not less but more government) as centralists.
These factions were also aligned with two wings of Masonry, the centralists favoring the Scottish rite and the federalists the York rite.
A prominent York rite Mason was American minister to Mexico, Joel R. Poinsett, who soon became a bête noire among Mexican conservatives.
Following Iturbide's abdication, Mexico adopted what was then the U.S. practice of choosing a president and vice-president from different parties.
Accordingly, the president chosen in 1824 was Guadalupe Victoria, a liberal federalist, and the vice-president General Nicolás Bravo, a conservative centralist.
Though Victoria served out his full four-year term, Bravo launched a rebellion against him in late 1827.
The rising was defeated by Guerrero, Bravo's old comrade-in-arms, and Bravo was sent into exile.
Bravo's unsuccessful revolt pretty much destroyed the power of the centralists but antagonism between liberals and conservatives survived as the federalists split into two factions.
In the 1928 election, Guerrero was the choice of the liberals while the conservatives rallied behind General Gómez Pedraza, a moderate, and General Anastasio Bustamante, a right-winger.
Though Gómez Pedraza was declared the winner, Guerrero refused to recognize the official election result.
A successful revolt in his favor was organized by Leonardo Zavala, ex-senator from Yucatán who had gained a reputation in the capital as a radical journalist.
Guerrero was then duly "elected" and assumed the presidency on April 1, 1829.
As a sop to the conservatives, Bustamante continued as vice-president.
Though Guerrero was a redoubtable soldier, he was out of his element in the political arena.
The real power behind the throne was the ultra-liberal Zavala and, the conservatives claimed, the gringo diplomat Poinsett.
In July 1829 the ambitious Santa Anna defeated an attempted Spanish invasion of Mexico, thus becoming a national hero.
Though Guerrero was still too popular to become the main target of conservative attacks, they concentrated their fire on Zavala and Poinsett.
This campaign was successful.
Zavala, whom Guerrero had appointed as war minister, was compelled to resign in November 1829 and Poinsett to leave the country.
Joined by Bravo, who had returned from exile, Bustamante mounted a revolt against Guerrero on December 4.
On January 1, 1830, Bustamante assumed the presidency as Congress stripped Guerrero of his powers.
Returning to his homeland in the south, Guerrero mounted an insurrection against Bustamante.
Though Bustamante's forces suffered initial defeats, Guerrero was captured through a ruse.
Bustamante's minister of war and marine, José Antonio Facio, paid a Genoese captain fifty thousand pesos to invite Guerrero aboard his vessel, then anchored in Acapulco.
Boarding the ship, Guerrero was seized and taken to the city of Oaxaca.
There, after a farcical court-martial, he was executed on February 14, 1831.
Why was Guerrero treated so cruelly?
Other dissidents, notably Nicolás Bravo on the right and Leonardo Zavala on the left, were either sent into exile or allowed to resign their posts.
An explanation is furnished by Jan Bazant, professor of history at the Colegio de Mexico, one that paints an unpleasant picture of racism and class prejudice.
Writes Bazant: "The clue is provided by Zavala who ... noted that Guerrero was of mixed blood and that the opposition to his presidency came from (elites) ... These people (feared) racial and social subversion.
Despite his revolutionary past, the wealthy creole Bravo belonged to this 'gentleman's club" as did ... Zavala, even with his radicalism...Guerrero's execution was perhaps a warning to men considered as socially and ethnically inferior not to dare to dream of becoming president."
GUERRERO DECREE.
The Guerrero Decree, which abolished slavery throughout the Republic of Mexico except in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, was issued by President Vicente R. Guerrero on September 15, 1829.
Guerrero may have acted under the influence of José María Tornel, who hoped the decree would be a check on American immigration, or he may have issued it as a personal measure because his enemies accused him of being partly of African descent.
The decree reached Texas on October 16, but Ramón Músquiz, the political chief, withheld its publication because it was in violation of the colonization laws, which guaranteed the settlers security for their persons and property.
The news of the decree did alarm the Texans, who petitioned Guerrero to exempt Texas from the operation of the law.
On December 2 Agustín Viesca, secretary of relations, wrote the governor of Texas that no change would be made respecting the slaves in Texas.
Though the decree was never put into operation, it left a conviction in the minds of many Texas colonists that their interests were not safe.
RAMÓN MÚSQUIZ (ca. 1797–?)
.
Ramón Músquiz, merchant and political figure, son of Miguel Francisco Músquiz, a military officer, and Catarina Gonzales, was born around 1797.
He married Francisca Castañeda, daughter of Lt. Col. Juan de Castañeda and Josefa Fernández, in San Antonio on December 16, 1823.
By 1830 they had two children, Francisca and Ramón.
Músquiz's first contacts with Texas were as postmaster of Monclova, Coahuila, Mexico, a position he held at the end of the Spanish Texas period.
Along with his official contacts, his father's brief service as military commander at Nacogdoches at the turn of the century must have given Músquiz a sense of business opportunities on the Texas frontier, for he undertook a series of business trips through the province in the early 1820s.
By the end of 1823 he had established himself in San Antonio, where he operated a store and became involved in local political affairs.
From July 1825 until August 1827 he served as secretary to the political chief.
Appointed by the governor of Coahuila and Texas to serve as political chief of the Department of Texas beginning in January 1828, Músquiz held the position until July 7, 1834, when he resigned, citing health reasons.
During his tenure as political chief, Músquiz lobbied in favor of Anglo-American colonists, particularly in regard to slavery, Indian depredations, and contraband trade.
He also attempted to mediate disputes between the colonists and national authorities, although he disapproved of the extralegal convention held at San Felipe in October 1832 and became distrustful of the Anglo-Americans' intentions.
Despite his retirement as political chief, Músquiz remained involved in public affairs, balancing his Federalist political leanings with a strong loyalty to Mexico.
In 1835 he was elected vice governor on the same ticket that the Federalist Agustín Viesca was elected governor, probably because he was acceptable to conservatives.
After Viesca's arrest and the annulment of his election by the national congress in the early summer of 1835, an effort was made to name Músquiz governor, but General Martín Perfecto de Cos also considered his election void and Músquiz never assumed office.
Unlike Viesca and other Federalists, Músquiz had not fallen out of favor and Cos considered him eligible for reappointment as political chief.
His continued loyalty to Mexico was further demonstrated in December 1835, when Cos appointed him to assist in the negotiations between the Mexican army and the Texans at the siege of Bexar.
Whether or not he left with Cos's retreating forces or remained in San Antonio, Músquiz was present at the fall of the Alamo and assisted in identifying the bodies of the defenders.
In May 1836 Músquiz departed Texas for Monclova, where he lived out his life, though he returned to Texas briefly in the late 1850s to reclaim lands abandoned upon his departure.
AGUSTÍN VIESCA (1790–1845).
Agustín (Augustín) Viesca, Mexican minister of relations under Vicente Ramón Guerrero, was born on May 5, 1790.
He was elected governor of Coahuila and Texas on September 9, 1834, but the election was questioned by Juan José Elguézabal, incumbent governor.
The election was confirmed and Viesca took office on April 14, 1835, at the time of the controversy between Saltillo and Monclova over location of the capital.
Viesca assembled the militia to quell a revolt in Saltillo but was ordered to disband the force by Martín Perfecto de Cos, who supported claims of Saltillo to the capital.
On April 21, 1835 the state legislature disbanded and authorized the governor to move the seat of government to any site he might select.
Viesca decided to move the capital to Bexar and urged the Texans to rise against the anti-Republican movement.
On May 25 he left Monclova with the archives but at the Hacienda de Hermanas learned of orders not to cross into Texas; therefore, he returned to Monclova and disbanded the militia.
Later, with other state officials, Benjamin R. Milam, and John Cameron, he attempted a secret escape to Texas but was captured on June 8 and sent as a prisoner to Monterrey.
He escaped his guards and by November 11, 1835, arrived at Goliad in company with Dr. James Grant and José María Gonzales, a cavalry officer from Bexar.
By that time anti-Mexican sentiment was so strong that the officials at Goliad preferred a declaration of Texas independence to asserting loyalty to the Mexican Constitution of 1824, and Viesca was not acknowledged as governor, a point on which he protested to Stephen F. Austin.
Viesca arrived in Nacogdoches on January 5, 1836, and was well received there.
He died on November 24, 1845.
SLAVERY.
Texas was the last frontier of slavery in the United States.
In fewer than fifty years, from 1821 to 1865, the "Peculiar Institution," as Southerners called it, spread over the eastern two-fifths of the state.
The rate of growth accelerated rapidly during the 1840s and 1850s.
The rich soil of Texas held much of the future of slavery, and Texans knew it.
James S. Mayfield undoubtedly spoke for many when he told the Constitutional Convention of 1845 that "the true policy and prosperity of this country depend upon the maintenance" of slavery.
Slavery as an institution of significance in Texas began in Stephen F. Austin's colony.
The original empresario commission given Moses Austin by Spanish authorities in 1821 did not mention slaves, but when Stephen Austin was recognized as heir to his father's contract later that year, it was agreed that settlers could receive eighty acres of land for each bondsman brought to Texas.
Enough of Austin's original 300 families brought slaves with them that a census of his colony in 1825 showed 443 in a total population of 1,800.
The independence of Mexico cast doubt on the future of the institution in Texas.
From 1821 until 1836 both the national government in Mexico City and the state government of Coahuila and Texas threatened to restrict or destroy black servitude.
Neither government adopted any consistent or effective policy to prevent slavery in Texas; nevertheless, their threats worried slaveholders and possibly retarded the immigration of planters from the Old South.
In 1836 Texas had an estimated population of 38,470, only 5,000 of whom were slaves.
The Texas Revolution assured slaveholders of the future of their institution.
The Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1836) provided that slaves would remain the property of their owners, that the Texas Congress could not prohibit the immigration of slaveholders bringing their property, and that slaves could be imported from the United States (although not from Africa).
Given those protections, slavery expanded rapidly during the period of the republic.
By 1845, when Texas joined the United States, the state was home to at least 30,000 bondsmen.
After statehood, in antebellum Texas, slavery grew spectacularly.
The census of 1850 reported 58,161 slaves, 27.4 percent of the 212,592 people in Texas, and the census of 1860 enumerated 182,566 bondsmen, 30.2 percent of the total population.
Slaves were increasing more rapidly than the population as a whole.
The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states.
Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade.
New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Galveston and Houston, too.
A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade.
Slave prices inflated rapidly as the institution expanded in Texas.
The average price of a bondsman, regardless of age, sex, or condition, rose from approximately $400 in 1850 to nearly $800 by 1860.
During the late 1850s, prime male field hands aged eighteen to thirty cost on the average $1,200, and skilled slaves such as blacksmiths often were valued at more than $2,000.
In comparison, good Texas cotton land could be bought for as little as six dollars an acre.
Slavery spread over the eastern two-fifths of Texas by 1860 but flourished most vigorously along the rivers that provided rich soil and relatively inexpensive transportation.
The greatest concentration of large slave plantations was along the lower Brazos and Colorado rivers in Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton counties.
Truly giant slaveholders such as Robert and D. G. Mills, who owned more than 300 bondsmen in 1860 (the largest holding in Texas), had plantations in this area, and the population resembled that of the Old South's famed Black Belt.
Brazoria County, for example, was 72 percent slave in 1860, while north central Texas, the area from Hunt County west to Jack and Palo Pinto counties and south to McLennan County, had fewer slaves than any other settled part of the state, except for Hispanic areas such as Cameron County.
However, the north central region held much excellent cotton land, and slavery would probably have developed rapidly there once rail transportation was built.
The last frontier of slavery was by no means closed on the eve of the Civil War.
American slavery was preeminently an economic institution-a system of unfree labor used to produce cash crops for profit.
Questions concerning its profitability are complex and always open to debate.
The evidence is strong, however, that in Texas slaves were generally profitable as a business investment for individual slaveholders.
Slave labor produced cotton (and sugar on the lower Brazos River) for profit and also cultivated the foodstuffs necessary for self-sufficiency.
The effect of the institution on the state's general economic development is less clear.
Slavery certainly promoted development of the agricultural economy; it provided the labor for a 600 percent increase in cotton production during the 1850s.
On the other hand, the institution may well have contributed in several ways to retarding commercialization and industrialization.
Planters, for example, being generally satisfied with their lives as slaveholders, were largely unwilling to involve themselves in commerce and industry, even if there was a chance for greater profits.
Slavery may have thus hindered economic modernization in Texas.
Once established as an economic institution, slavery became a key social institution as well.
Only one in every four families in antebellum Texas owned slaves, but these slaveholders, especially the planters who held twenty or more bondsmen, generally constituted the state's wealthiest class.
Because of their economic success, these planters represented the social ideal for many other Texans.
Slavery was also vital socially because it reflected basic racial views.
Most whites thought that blacks were inferior and wanted to be sure that they remained in an inferior social position.
Slavery guaranteed this.
Although the law contained some recognition of their humanity, slaves in Texas generally had the legal status of personal property.
They could be bought and sold, mortgaged, and hired out.
They had no legally prescribed way to gain freedom.
They had no property rights themselves and no legal rights of marriage and family.
Slaveowners had broad powers of discipline subject only to constitutional provisions that slaves be treated "with humanity" and that punishment not extend to the taking of life and limb.
A bondsman had a right to trial by jury and a court-appointed attorney when charged with a crime greater than petty larceny.
Blacks, however, could not testify against whites in court, a prohibition that largely negated their constitutional protection.
Bondsmen who did not work satisfactorily or otherwise displeased their owners were commonly punished by whipping.
Many slaves may have escaped such punishment, but every bondsman lived with the knowledge that he could be whipped at his owner's discretion.
The majority of adult slaves were field hands, but a sizable minority worked as skilled craftsmen, house servants, and livestock handlers.
Field hands generally labored "from sun to sun" five days a week and half a day on Saturday.
House servants and craftsmen worked long hours, too, but their labor was not so burdensome physically.
Theirs was apparently a favored position, at least in this regard.
A small minority (about 6 percent) of the slaves in Texas did not belong to farmers or planters but lived instead in the state's towns, working as domestic servants, day laborers, and mechanics.
The material conditions of slave life in Texas could probably best be described as adequate, in that most bondsmen had the food, shelter, and clothing necessary to live and work effectively.
On the other hand, there was little comfort and no luxury.
Slaves ate primarily corn and pork, foods that contained enough calories to provide adequate energy but were limited in essential vitamins and minerals.
Most bondsmen, however, supplemented their basic diet with sweet potatoes, garden vegetables, wild game, and fish and were thus adequately fed.
Slave houses were usually small log cabins with fireplaces for cooking.
Dirt floors were common, and beds attached to the walls were the only standard furnishings.
Slave clothing was made of cheap, coarse materials; shoes were stiff and rarely fitted.
Medical care in antebellum Texas was woefully inadequate for whites and blacks alike, but slaves had a harder daily life and were therefore more likely to be injured or develop diseases that doctors could not treat (see HEALTH AND MEDICINE).
Texas slaves had a distinct family-centered social life and culture that flourished in the slave quarters, where bondsmen were largely on their own, at least from sundown to sunup.
Although slave marriages and families had no legal protections, the majority of bondsmen were reared and lived day to day in a family setting.
This was in the slaveowners' self-interest, for marriage encouraged reproduction under socially acceptable conditions, and slave children were valuable.
Moreover, individuals with family ties were probably more easily controlled than those who had none.
The slaves themselves, however, also insisted on family ties.
They often made matches with bondsmen on neighboring farms and spent as much time as possible together, even if one owner or the other could not be persuaded to arrange for husband and wife to live on the same place.
They fought bitterly against the disruption of their families by sale or migration and at times virtually forced masters to respect family ties.
Many slave families, however, were disrupted.
All slaves had to live with the knowledge that their families could be broken up, and yet the basic social unit survived.
Family ties were a source of strength for people enduring bondage and a mark of their humanity, too.
Religion and music were also key elements of slave culture.
Many owners encouraged worship, primarily on the grounds that it would teach proper subjection and good behavior.
Slaves, however, tended to hear the message of individual equality before God and salvation for all.
The promise of ultimate deliverance helped many to resist the psychological assault of bondage.
Music and song served to set a pace for work and to express sorrow and hope.
Slaves adjusted their behavior to the conditions of servitude in a variety of ways.
Some felt well-treated by their owners and generally behaved as loyal servants.
Others hated their masters and their situation and rebelled by running away or using violence.
Texas had many runaways, and thousands escaped to Mexico.
Although no major rebellions occurred, individual acts of violence against owners were carried out.
Most slaves, however, were neither loyal servants nor rebels.
Instead, the majority recognized all the controls such as slave patrols that existed to keep them in bondage and saw also that runaways and rebels generally paid heavy prices for overt resistance.
They therefore followed a basic human instinct and sought to survive on the best terms possible.
This did not mean that the majority of slaves were content with their status.
They were not, and even the best-treated bondsmen dreamed of freedom.
Slavery in Texas was not a matter of content, well-cared for servants as idealized in some views of the Old South.
On the other hand, the institution was not absolutely brutal or degrading.
Slaves were not reduced to the level of animals, and they did not live every day in sullen rage.
Instead, bondsmen had enough "room"-time of their own and control of their own lives-within the slave system to maintain physical, psychological, and spiritual strength.
In part this limited autonomy was given by the masters, who generally wanted loyal and cheerful servants.
Slaves increased their minimal self-determination by taking what they could get from their owners and then pressing for additional latitude.
For example, slaves worked hard, but they tried to work at their own pace and offered many forms of nonviolent resistance if pushed too hard.
Slaves in general were not revolutionaries who overcame all the limits placed on them, but they did not surrender totally to the system, either.
One way or another they had enough room to endure.
This fact is not a tribute to the benevolence of slavery, but a testimony to the human spirit of the enslaved blacks.
Though slaves obviously freed their owners from the drudgery of manual labor and daily chores, they were a troublesome property in many ways.
Masters had to discipline their bondsmen, get the labor they wanted, and yet avoid too many problems of resistance such as running away and feigning illness.
Many owners wished to appear as benevolent "fathers," and yet most knew that there would be times when they would treat members of their "families" as property pure and simple.
Most lived with a certain amount of fear of their supposedly happy servants, for the slightest threat of a slave rebellion could touch off a violent reaction.
Slavery was thus a constant source of tension in the lives of slaveholders.
White society as a whole in antebellum Texas was dominated by its slaveholding minority.
Economically, slaveowners had a disproportionately large share of the state's wealth and produced virtually all of the cash crops.
Politically, slaveholders dominated public officeholding at all levels.
Socially, slaveholders, at least the large planters, embodied an ideal to most Texans.
The progress of the Civil War did not drastically affect slavery in Texas because no major slaveholding area was invaded.
In general, Texas slaves continued to work and live as they had before the war.
A great many did, however, get the idea that they would be free if the South lost.
They listened as best they could for any war news and passed it around among themselves.
Slavery formally ended in Texas after June 19, 1865 (Juneteenth), when Gen. Gordon Granger arrived at Galveston with occupying federal forces and announced emancipation.
A few owners angrily told their slaves to leave immediately, but most expressed sorrow at the end of the institution and asked their bondsmen to stay and work for wages.
The emancipated slaves celebrated joyously (if whites allowed it).
But then they had to find out just what freedom meant.
They knew that they would not be forced to labor anymore and that they could move about as they chose.
But how would they make their way in the world after 1865?
Blacks had maintained a degree of human dignity even in bondage (most owners had allowed them to do so), and Texas could not have grown as it had before 1865 without the slaves' contributions.
Nevertheless, slavery was a curse to Texans, white and black alike.

Mexico releases remaining Texas captives from Perote Prison
On this day in 1844, Mexican officials released 105 Texans from Perote Prison.
The freed men were the last of the captives taken in the Dawson Massacre, the Mier expedition, and the Texan Santa Fe expedition--all episodes in the ongoing strife between the Republic of Texas and a Mexican government that did not acknowledge the legitimacy of that republic.
Perote Prison was the jail chosen for Texan survivors of the republic's battles with Mexico.
The stronghold, in the Mexican state of Vera Cruz, was originally a moated castle built to hold treasure bound for Spain and to protect a trade route.
It was constructed in the 1770s.
The Texans who were held there had surrendered as prisoners of war, but were held simply as prisoners.
Nevertheless, they were evidently humanely treated.
The Mexican government released the last of them partly as a result of continued pressure from the United States and British governments.

PEROTE PRISON.
Perote Castle (originally the Castle of San Carlos), located in the Mexican state of Vera Cruz, was built over a seven-year period in the 1770s by the Spanish authorities in Mexico to guard one of their main trade routes and to serve as a depository for treasure awaiting shipment to Spain.
The stone fortress, covering an estimated twenty-six acres and surrounded by a moat, was used by the Mexican government as a prison.
In the dungeons of Perote most of the Texas prisoners captured by Mexico in the days of the Republic of Texas were incarcerated.
Texans imprisoned there were chiefly from three groups: the Texan Santa Fe expedition prisoners, the Nicholas Dawson prisoners, and the prisoners captured on the Mier expedition.
Some of the 300-odd members of the Texan Santa Fe expedition were confined at Perote during the winter of 1841–42.
Most of them were released at the general emancipation of the Santa Fe prisoners in June 1842.
In December 1842 about fifty men captured in San Antonio by Adrián Woll were placed in Perote, and a few months later various detachments of the Mier prisoners, about 200 in all, were also incarcerated there.
Despite the fact that they had surrendered as prisoners of war, the men were forced to perform common labor.
They were, however, allowed to communicate with friends, to receive money and gifts, and to purchase supplies outside Perote Castle.
Their plight aroused sympathy in Texas and in the United States, and in April 1843 President John Tyler instructed Waddy Thompson, United States minister in Mexico, to negotiate for release of the Texas prisoners and demand the release of any imprisoned citizens of the United States.
The Texas Congress made appropriations for the relief of the men at Perote, but the money never reached the prisoners, many of whom came to feel that their country was forsaking them and that President Sam Houston was not making any effort to secure their release.
Groups of the Perote prisoners were released from time to time through the influence of Thompson and the British minister, Lord Packenham.
On July 2, 1843, sixteen Texans escaped through a hole bored in the walls; eight were recaptured.
On March 25, 1844, sixteen other men effected an escape through a tunnel; of these, seven were recaptured.
On March 23, 1844, two days before, the Bexar prisoners had been released.
On September 16, 1844, the remaining Texas prisoners, about 105, were released.
Accurate records on the number who escaped, who were released through influence of friends, who died from disease, starvation, or exposure, and who were killed by Mexican guards are not available.
SAN ANTONIO PRISONERS
The True Story of the 1842 Invasion of San Antonio and Imprisonment of its citizens
A Work in Progress (April, 2006)
By Fred Riley Jones

He is a fifth generation native of South Texas, a graduate of Texas A&M University (B.S. 1976) and St. Mary's School of Law (J.D. 1979).

He is the 2nd great grandson of William Early Jones who was captured in San Antonio.]
Introduction.
It is a little known fact that seven years after the Battle of the Alamo and the Battle of San Jacinto, Gen. Antonio Santa Anna launched another invasion of Texas.
This time, the Texans were unprepared -- they thought the war for independence had been won, and they had begun the process of conducting civil government.
This is the true account of the "Woll Invasion" of 1842, in which Santa Anna's handpicked soldier of fortune, Gen. Adrian Woll and his army of 1000 Mexican regulars and 600 Presidial troops attacked San Antonio.
Gen. Woll captured the District Judge, the District Clerk, the District Attorney, the litigants, some of the jurors and other citizens, and all members of the San Antonio Bar except one.
They became known as the "San Antonio Prisoners," and they were forced to walk from San Antonio to Perote Prison near Vera Cruz, deep in the heart of Mexico.
Some of the San Antonio prisoners paid the ultimate price; others were imprisoned under harsh conditions and forced to work at hard labor for six months, while still others were kept captive for two years.
The disruption to the San Antonio court system lasted much longer.
What started out as a novelty to the author, whose paternal great-great grandfather was one of the San Antonio Prisoners, quickly turned into a much larger project that took far more time than originally thought.
Years after beginning the project, and working on holidays and in rare hours of "free time," the author began to realize that his ancestor had been one of the fortunate few who not only survived the long journey, but was released and allowed to return to his family after a period of six months.
Other gallant men and boys were killed in initial heroic efforts to rescue the San Antonio Prisoners.
Those who survived the rescue attempts were put in chains and marched _______ miles to a dark and damp prison.
Some died along the way, others died while in prison, and the remaining few were released after two years, returning to their families and a Republic changed by the rapid pace of events.
These were real men, with wives, parents and children looking to them for support.
The people who came to their aid were likewise real people, and many of them died believing that a greater good would be accomplished by their efforts.
The response of their friends and loved ones, taking care of the widows and orphaned children was common and to be expected at the time, but now seems more than remarkable.
As reported by E.W. Winkler in his editorial accompanying three reported accounts of the capture and imprisonment of the Bexar prisoners, "the fate of the Bexar prisoners was a peculiarly severe one.
Among them were men of talent and high respectability.
Many were heads of families, and away from home when made prisoners.
None anticipated or had prepared for the captivity into which he was dragged.
They have not received the attention in the past that their case merits."
(Texas Historical Association Quarterly at p. 292).
The 1842 Term of Court.
On September 5, 1842, Judge Anderson Hutchinson opened the District Court at San Antonio de Bexar, Republic of Texas.
Judge Hutchinson hoped this term of Court would go smoothly, but he couldn't help but remember that it was only six months earlier that he tried to hold court in Bexar County, only to be forced to flee on account of Vasquez' raid.
In March, 1842, General Rafael Vasquez had invaded San Antonio without resistance, plundered the town and then retreated to Mexico.
The Judge and his family, who had migrated from Mississippi only a few years earlier, had lost their piano and most of their clothing in the earlier raid.
It has been reported that the Vasquez raid was in retaliation for the Santa Fe expedition by Texans in 1841 in an attempt to take over Santa Fe (Webb, Walter Prescott, The Texas  Rangers, p. 71-71).
Now, with the ratification of the third treaty between England and the Republic of Texas, and the request by the United States that Texas suspend hostilities against Mexico, Judge Hutchinson believed peace was inevitable and that he could get on with the business of the Court in this still uncertain legal environment.
The Treaty of Velasco negotiated between Burnet and Santa Anna at San Jacinto had been repudiated by the Mexican nation.
In that treaty, Santa Anna had agreed to cease all hostilities toward the Texans and never again to take up arms against them; he agreed to keep all Mexican soldiers south of the Rio Grande and to release all prisoners.
He had also agreed to work within Mexico to achieve recognition of Texas' independence from the entire Mexican government and to secure a treaty of commerce between the nations.
The Rio Grande was established as the political boundary between Mexico and Texas (Whisenhut, Donald W., Texas, A Sesquicentennial Celebration, p. 83).
The docket call for the September 1842 term had called for lawyers from San Antonio and nearby counties to attend.
William Early Jones, a lawyer from Gonzales who served as a member of the Republic of Texas House of Representatives, was in attendance (Jones' handwritten account of the invasion of San Antonio and his subsequent captivity is contained in the Lamar Papers, which were purchased by Governor Campbell in 1909 and deposited in the State Library).
Neither he nor his fellow lawyers planned to be away from their families for very long.
The Judge and the lawyers did not have time to be distracted by threats of invasion and war.
They still believed the struggle for independence from Mexico had been won.
After all, the battle of San Jacinto occurred many years before and it was not every day that the circuit judge came to hold court in San Antonio; the lawyers and their clients were anxious to test the judiciary of the Republic of Texas in its infancy.
During the Texas Revolution, the courts had not been available for resolution of civil disputes.
It was finally time to seek redress in the civil courts for misdeeds which had taken place during the conflict.
Trespass to try title, suits on notes and actions for assault and battery were being heard for the first time in years.
Many of the later decisions of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas excused such delays as one of the necessary results of the struggle for independence.
According to eyewitnesses, "there were some visitors in San Antonio in excess of the population on account of the district court being in session" (Account of John Perry given to A.J. Sowell, reported in the San Antonio Express, September 29, 1901).
The first case to be tried was filed by Dr. Shields Booker against the City of San Antonio, for a fifty peso fee promised by San Antonio Mayor Juan N. Seguin.
Dr. Booker was represented by Samuel A. Maverick, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence and congressman-elect.
The testimony in Booker vs. The City of San Antonio was in Spanish.
The minutes, written in longhand by the District Clerk, were also in Spanish (David Garcia, Bexar County District Clerk,  was kind enough to pull the original minute books covering the September 1842 term of the Bexar County District Court.
Most of the minutes written in longhand are in spanish.
The minutes reflect that on September 9, 1842, the case was continued, "the Mexican troops being in possession of this place").
While the trial was interesting, probably more interesting was the rumor of an impending invasion by Mexican troops.
On Monday, September 5, 1842, Judge Hutchinson wrote in his diary: "Opened the District Court of Bexar.
No invasion expected."
On Friday, September 9, 1842, Judge Hutchinson was advised in confidence of the approach of 1,500 to 3,000 Mexican troops.
The rumor was sufficiently authenticated to induce the belief that a force of some character was advancing, but it appeared to be a party of marauders and not regular troops, who were endeavoring to create the impression that their force was much stronger than it really was.
On Saturday, September 10, 1842, a public meeting was held, with Judge Hutchinson presiding.
The rumors of an impending invasion were discussed and generally discredited.
In his later account of the events, William Early Jones recalled that "the whole day of the 10th ... passed ... strengthening the general belief that the rumor was either a hoax or the character of the forced advancing misrepresented."
The citizens appointed Captain John C. Hays, a surveyor by trade, but later to become an indian fighter and distinguished member of the Texas Rangers, to command a group of five men to investigate the rumors.
Col. Hays and five other "well mounted men" went out as scouts.
They took the public roads, saw nothing and did not attempt to return to the town until it was too late.
The approaching Mexican army had left the established roads to approach the town through the hills (Webb, p. 73).
According to an eyewitness, the Mexican forces were coming from the west and cutting their road as they advanced, and had done so all the way from the Rio Grande.
Since the country was not settled no one saw his force until they were close to San Antonio (Perry, p.1).
With no word from the scouts, the day passed without any preparation for an invasion.
When Hays returned to San Antonio, he found it surrounded by a force estimated at thirteen hundred (Hays to Secretary of War, September 12, 1842, Journals of the House of representatives of the Republic of Texas, Seventh Congress, Appendix, p. 16).
The Woll Invasion.
Unfortunately, the advancing force had been underestimated.
Gen. Woll was a Frenchman and a soldier of fortune who had 1,000 Mexican regulars, 600 presidial troops and a powerful artillery.
General Woll was an educated man (According to Jeff Long in his book Duel of Eagles, General Woll was a wandering french mercenary who had joined the Mexican army after failing to gain a spot in the United States Army.
see p. 134).
Maybe he had read Shakespeare's ________________, in which _________________ tried to disengage the last defenders of democracy and justice by suggesting that "first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers."
Or maybe he thought that if he captured the lawyers and other influential citizens of San Antonio, his employers, and especially General Santa Anna, would be impressed.
Whatever his thoughts at the time, later events in the campaign would prove disappointing to General Woll.
Ironically, Juan Seguin, a Tejano hero of the Battle of San Jacinto who had served the Republic of Texas in the 1838 Senate and the City of San Antonio as its Mayor from 1842 until April, 1842, was now accompanying Gen. Woll in this invasion of San Antonio.
After being forced to resign as Mayor in April, 1842, Seguin moved to Mexico and was captured by Santa Anna's forces.
It has been said that when Santa Anna discovered that Seguin had been captured, he sent Seguin with Gen. Woll on the San Antonio invasion to prove his loyalty to Mexico (Long, Jeff, Duel of Eagles, pp. 333-334.
At daylight on Sunday, Gen. Woll advanced into Military Square (now the site of the City Hall of the city of San Antonio) under a dense fog.
The citizens of Bexar were awakened by the firing of a piece of cannon, succeeded immediately by the sound of martial music and the tramp of a body of men.
General Woll had surrounded the town with Mexican regular soldiers and had posted a confidant named Lt. Cordova and a band of Cherokees at the passes to the Alamo.
A company of San Antonio defenders fired toward the music down the street.
The fire was returned by the Mexicans with volleys of musketry and rapid discharges from a six and four pound cannon.
As soon as the smoke and fog cleared, it was discovered that the town was surrounded on all sides by the Mexican soldiers.
A local citizen named Corasco waved a white flag and then discussed the situation with General Woll.
Later, Mr. Corasco reported to the citizens of Bejar that General Woll had 2,000 soldiers and had given the citizens a half hour to surrender.
Jones, Maverick and a few others were sent to a parley with General Woll.
Under the circumstances, they were not in a position to negotiate.
It was agreed that the citizens would surrender as prisoners of war -- their lives and property (except arms) to be spared and secured.
Informed of the mistake under which the citizens had resisted, General Woll advised that but for the mischief done (some 30 Mexican soldiers killed or wounded) he would have permitted them to disperse.
Under the circumstances, however, he would have to take prisoners.
The prisoners would include all male Anglo citizens in the town  (Lone Star, p. 261).
He promised that the prisoners would be treated as gentlemen.
Fifty-five citizens were imprisoned, including Judge Hutchinson, the District Attorney, the clerk, all members of the Bar (including Maverick and Jones) except one, along with other citizens of Bexar and adjacent counties.
After five days of imprisonment in San Antonio, the prisoners were told they would be required to march to the banks of the Rio Grande, where General Woll promised that they would be set free by his superior officer, General Reyes.
Although it was probably never intended, these lawyers, litigants, citizens, and officers of the court were destined to become prisoners of war in a desperate attempt by Santa Anna to accomplish several goals -- disrupt civil proceedings and the progress of government in Texas, demonstrate the strength of his forces, assert Mexican sovereignty, chastise the Texans, give U.S. annexationists and European allies reason to be concerned, and, ultimately, to regain the Texas lost in the battle of San Jacinto.
" (See generally, Fehrenbach, Lone Star, p. 478)  Also, it was rumored that Gen. Woll's next target after San Antonio was going to be Austin, hoping that a capture of the capital would be the end of Texas independence.
Perhaps Santa Anna's goals were less ambitious, and the invasion was meant to keep the Texans in check and dissuade attempts to further advance the Texas line into Mexican territory.
Texas Responds.
During this time, unbeknownst to the prisoners, there were calls around the Republic for help for the Bexar prisoners.
Col. Hays and other couriers spread the word that San Antonio had again fallen and that the district court in session there had been captured.
The news of the capture of San Antonio by General Woll spread throughout the Republic and, as later described by E.W. Winkler in Volume XIII of the Quarterly of the Texas State Historical Association was "a call for the gathering of companies of frontiersmen in the valleys of the Guadalupe and the Colorado.
They united under the leadership of Colonel Matthew Caldwell, 'Old Paint', who had only recently returned from imprisonment in Mexico, having been a member of the Santa Fe expedition."
Caldwell, who was in Gonzales at the time, brought 85 men, and was elected to command the two hundred and twenty five men who had assembled, in an effort to put an end to Woll's plans to recapture Texas.
The Battle of Salado Creek.
This conflict, which has become known as the Battle of Salado Creek, occurred on September 18, 1842.
Col. Caldwell, with his volunteers from Gonzales, was successful, having turned the Mexican army.
Note: following is from Wallace McKeehan's article on Adam Zumwalt, Jr.:
On 17 Sep, 202 minutemen had rallied on the Cibolo on the San Antonio Road above Seguin.
Among them were som prisoners involved in the unsuccessful Santa Fe expedition including Colonel Matthew Caldwell who was elected commander of the group.
Dr. Caleb S. Brown of Gonzales was named surgeon.
Companies included 35 men under Capt. Daniel B. Friar of Cuero, 60 men from Gonzales and Seguin under Capt. James Bird of Gonzales (James H. Callahan of Seguin was 1st Lt.), 40 cowboys and Victorians under Capt. Ewen Cameron (Lts.
John R. Baker and Alfred Allee) and 43 men from the Lavaca River under Captain "Black" Adam Zumwalt (John H. Livergood and Nicholas Ryan as Lts., John Henry Brown as Sargent).
Among the others were James (Black Jim) Brown, Joshua D. Brown, Wilson Clark, Henry Cleveland, Nereus Dufner, Beverly C. Greenwood, William M. Phillips, Jonathan Scott, John Pius Smith, William Smothers, Oliver H. Stapp, Wilson Vandyke, George Walton, Wingate Woodley, Andrew Zumwalt, Isaac Zumwalt and Thomas Zumwalt.
Andrew, Isaac and Thomas were sons of Capt. Zumwalt and George Walton a son-in-law.
Cousin Nathan Boone Burkett was one of the 'cowboys,' noted as such because they subsisted for days on wild cattle and other game, in the company of Capt. Cameron.
Cousin Jesse Zumwalt, son of 'Red' Adam Zumwalt is also thought to have participated and was wounded in the battle.
On 17 Sep after General Woll had occupied San Antonio for a week, the Texans marched overland to Salado Creek about 6 miles east of San Antonio below present New Braunfels.
Col Caldwelll instructed Capt. John C. Hays and his company of scouts and spies to lure the greater than 1440 strong Mexican force toward the force of 202 Texans.
From a ridge 300 to 400 yards from the Alamo, Hays men waved, shouted and challenged the enemy to come out of the Alamo onto the field, as if they were preparing for confrontation at the site.
The actions resulted in a charge of over 400 Mexican cavalrymen from the Alamo, which turned to a hot pursuit when Capt. Hays and the company turned toward the Salado.
Some distance out, the mount of Capt. Augustus H. Jones of Gonzales [William Early Jones' brother], a close personal friend of Capt. Hays began to falter relative to the main force.
Capt. Hays put the entire company just behind Capt. Jones with his slower mount leading the way.
The contingent led the Mexican force across the Salado half a mile above the main Texan force under Capt. [sic, Col/?]
Caldwell.
After 2 to 3 hours of skirmishing, Gen. Woll arrived with about 800 infantrymen and his two cannon.
After a face to face confrontation with Capt. Caldwell's forces, the front lines of the Mexican infantry were forced to fall back behind their cannon and cover due to heavy casualties.
The Mexicans made several smaller charges that were repulsed with heavy casualties.
At sundown Gen. Woll and his force retired to San Antonio with their casualties.
The Battle of Salado Creek took place at the present day site of the Mehren House on Holbrook Road.
The Mexicans had casualties of 60 men and about as many wounded.
Col. Caldwell's force suffered only one casualty and 9 wounded.
A Texas War for Independence marker was erected on the site in 1936, and in 1979 the battlefield was included in the National Register of Historic Places.
The Dawson Massacre.
Meanwhile, in LaGrange, Captain Nicholas Mosby Dawson gathered a group of volunteers to join with Col. Caldwell.
Dawson and his men left LaGrange on September 16th, and picked up additional volunteers as they traveled along the Old Seguin Road toward San Antonio.
Capt. Dawson and his volunteers attempted to join Col. Caldwell, but instead came upon the rear of Gen. Woll's army as he was retreating to San Antonio after the battle with Col. Caldwell.
Dawson's force, which numbered only fifty three, was confronted by about 200 calvary, armed with one of Gen. Woll's cannon.
The Mexican forces surrounded Dawson's men and began firing the cannon.
The Mexicans stayed out of rifle range and were able to kill or wound more than half of Dawson's men.
In what has become known as "Dawson's Massacre," thirty five Texans were killed, two or three escaped and fifteen were taken prisoner.
The following is McKeehan's account of the Dawson Massacre:  The exact details of subsequent events vary with the reporter, but most historians agree that Dawson raised the white flag of surrender.
Either the men were not unified in the surrender decision, in panic fired on Mexican troops handling the surrender at point blank range or some Mexican troops failed to cease fire or a combination of both.
They were charged by the Mexican force and shot down systematically until Col. Corrasco and other Mexican officers regained control of their men.
According to L.U. Spellmann in his article Letters of the "Dawson Men from Perote Prison", ___ Southwestern Historical Quarterly 246, "Dawson undertook to surrender, but some of his men were slow to cease firing and the Mexicans, who had partially ceased, began again....
Ultimately, three of Dawson's men escaped and fifteen survivors were taken prisoner and joined with the San Antonio Prisoners.
Of the fifteen survivors, only nine ultimately returned to their homes and families.
The remains of the brave men who fell in Dawson's Massacre were ultimately interred at the tomb at Monument Hill in La Grange, Texas, along with the remains of 16 of the 17 men executed by order of Santa Anna in what became known as the Black Bean death lottery.
On September 26th, Woll negotiated an armistice.
The heroic efforts of Col. Caldwell and Captain Nicholas Dawson, though unsuccessful, prevented General Woll from advancing to Austin, where he planned further interference with the efforts by the fledgling Republic of Texas to establish law and order and a system of democratic government.
The conflict and resulting massacre are chronicled on the historical signs near Austin Highway and Holbrook Road in San Antonio, where they mostly go unnoticed by the motoring public.
The Long Walk to Perote.
Meanwhile, General Woll began his retreat to the Rio Grande with the prisoners from the San Antonio Courthouse.
After spending one night on the Medina River south of San Antonio, the prisoners continued to march under a guard of 150 to 160 men for the Rio Grande.
By special favor, some of the prisoners were allowed to ride on horses.
After eight days, they reached the river, described by Jones as "a bold, rapid river 250 or 300 yards wide" (There were no dams upstream as there are today).
At the crossing, the prisoners found themselves deceived.
They were not allowed to go free as earlier promised; they were ordered to cross the river in two canoes, probably some of those used by Woll in crossing at the same point (Account of Judge Hutchinson, Texas Historical Association Quarterly, at p. 298.
Judge Hutchinson commented that Woll had spent nine days crossing the Rio Grande on his way to San Antonio).
The day was spent in getting across the river, and the prisoners spent the night on the Mexican side of the river.
It was here they learned of the death of John R. Cunningham, a lawyer who had been compelled to leave San Antonio sick with congestive fever, and had been left behind on the third day in one of the carts which conveyed the 30 or so Mexicans wounded in the fight.
Upon reaching Presidio Rio Grande, a town somewhat smaller than San Antonio at that time, the ears of the prisoners were "pierced with the screams of the wives of the Presidiales whose husbands had fallen" (Hutchinson Diary, p. 298).
The prisoners marched for three days to San Fernando, where they again heard the cries of grief for husbands and friends slain in battle.
After being detained for seven days at San Fernando, a "statement of facts" surrounding the invasion, the resistance and surrender was prepared by Jones and signed by him and Maverick, as the representatives of the crowd.
The statement was both a tribute of respect to Gen. Santa Anna and a protest of the conditions under which the San Antonio prisoners were being held.
The commanding Mexican Army officer promised to send the document to Santa Anna with his favorable recommendations.
The prisoners were ordered to march for Mexico City, under a mounted escort consisting of about eighty men, who rode on each side of the road while the prisoners occupied the road.
General Reyes embraced Judge Hutchinson, saying that he had written to Santa Anna for the release of the judge.
Some members of the Mexican force shed tears at leaving the hapless judge and his fellow prisoners.
Their journeys were long or short each day to suit the country through which they traveled, and some days they were forced to march from daylight until dark, making 13 to 14 leagues (39 - 42 miles).
The prisoners were detained in Saltillo for sixteen days, closely housed up and never permitted to leave the cuartel.
Jones described the route from Saltillo to San Luis Potosi as being through a poor and almost unpopulated country.
When the prisoners reached San Luis Potosi, they were paraded through every public street as a show, followed by an immense crowd of people.
They remained in San Luis Potosi for two days, and received a visit from the Governor.
From San Luis Potosi to Mexico City, the road passed many splendid estates, the entire grounds of some of which were enclosed by stone walls.
Jones described one enclosure as containing 36 square miles.
When the prisoners were within 20 leagues of Mexico City, they were detained for a week in a miserable prison at a place called Tulea, where they were informed that their destination was not the City of Mexico, but the Castle of Perote, and that they would not be permitted to pass through the city, although they would go in sight of it.
Upon arrival at Perote, a fortress at the foot of the extinct volcano called "Confra de Perote," the prisoners were allowed to go about the castle.
According to Jones, the castle was built in 1773, mounted 96 pieces of cannon and covered 26 acres inside the outer pickets.
The main building was said to cover ten acres.
On the fifth day, the prisoners were chained in pairs and put to work, packing sand stone lime into the castle.
Jones described the food as consisting of "poor beef, one day in three; beans, potatoes, rice and bread--badly cooked.
The rations of these articles were always small, not being sufficient for a hearty man."
They were later joined by the prisoners from the Mier Expedition.
The Mier expedition was an ill-fated and ill-advised invasion by 300 Texans into Mexico, in revenge for the Woll invasion.
The expedition resulted in a disgraceful plunder of Laredo, and later, an attack on the small adobe village of Mier, where a large amount of military supplies were stored as well as a large garrison of Mexican soldiers.
McCaleb, Walter F., The Mier Expedition.
While the Texans fought and then plundered, the Mexicans fortified their numbers and ultimately persuaded the Texans to surrender, under false promises of good treatment and false warnings of a powerful Mexican force being brought to bear.
The weary Texan forces surrendered, remembering what had happened at the Alamo, and not knowing that in truth, "the Mexicans were prepared to flee should the Texans refuse to surrender."
Id.
They surrendered under assurances that they would be treated "... with the consideration that is in accordance with the magnanimous Mexican nation."
Id.
After an unsuccessful attempt to escape back to Texas, the survivors were imprisoned at the Castle of Perote, along with the prisoners from San Antonio.
The prisoners stayed at Perote until March 22, 1843, at which time Judge Hutchinson, Jones and Maverick were ordered to Mexico City.
Their chains were knocked off before they left the castle, and the trio was allowed to ride by paying the hire of horses; they paid their own expenses even though they were still prisoners.
The journey allowed Jones and his companions to observe the "complete and perfect dominion of the military over the civil authorities."
On their arrival at the City of Mexico, they were first paraded for a quarter of an hour, ragged and dirty, in front of the Palace--then sent into it and sent to prison.
By this time, the United States had interceded, and after a brief time in prison, Hutchinson, Jones and Maverick were allowed to tour the City for three days at perfect liberty.
According to Jones, they endeavored to see everything to be seen in that remarkable place, in that short time.
At the request of General Waddy Thompson from the United States [General Waddy Thompson was a United States representative from South Carolina and was minister to the Republic of Mexico.
He was acquainted with Samuel Maverick and William E. Jones in the United States], the trio was released for passage back to Texas on March 29, 1843, on board the U.S. Sloop of War Vincennes, via Vera Cruz and Pensacola.
Hutchinson, Maverick and Jones were released as a personal favor by General Santa Anna to General Waddy Thompson.
Reportedly, General Thompson told General Santa Anna that he had a favor to ask, and Santa Anna said that the favor would be granted before he knew the nature of the request.
Santa Anna kept his word, granting General Thompson the "favor" of allowing Hutchinson, Jones and Maverick to board the ship to return to Texas.
The majority of the prisoners remained in captivity at Perote until March 23, 1844.
Samuel Maverick returned to his law practice.
Jones repaired to the capital of Texas to seek aid for his fellow prisoners remaining in Mexico.
He returned as a legislator from Gonzales County, and attended the Eighth Congress of the Republic.
His warrant for "services and losses" including reparations for the loss of a horse, saddle, and bridle incurred while a "San Antonio Prisoner" is on file in the Lamar Papers (In 1852, almost ten years after his capture and imprisonment, Jones was paid the sum of $503 for "services and losses sustained while a San Antonio prisoner" as part of the debt of the Late Republic of Texas).
Later, he was unanimously appointed by Eighth Congress to be the judge of the Fourth Judicial District, replacing his fellow prisoner, Judge Hutchinson, who apparently had enough of the Republic of Texas and returned to Mississippi.
In a detailed diary, Judge Hutchinson wrote: "In a word it is impossible for me to sustain in safety my family in any part of the 4th district, and being unwilling to reside in middle or eastern Texas, I am compelled to resume professional practice in Mississippi."
He returned to Texas once to get his salary, to sell his Code of Texas, and to remove his library to Mississippi (Texas Historical Association Quarterly, at p. 311; see also, Henry S. Foote, The Bench and Bar of the South and Southwest, iv, 85).
As a District Judge of the Republic, Jones was also a member of a Committee organized as the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas.
He served as the last judge of the Fourth Judicial District under the Republic.
The case of Shields Booker vs. The City of San Antonio was never re-tried.
Dr. Booker was shot in Perote Prison by a Mexican soldier, and died from his wounds on March 21, 1843
Letter dated March 22, 1843 from Richard A. Barkley, whose father and a brother were killed in Dawson's Massacre.
He was taken prisoner and wrote letters to H.G. Woods, a friend who escaped the Massacre.
"Dr. Booker of Bexar was shot last Sunday by a Mexican soldier some think by a axadent but I had as soon think dune on perpose as not -- he dide last nite they are now bering [burying] him on the dich that encloses this Prison -- to die in prison in chanes & on a blanket & by the hand of a rufian is two hard."
See Southwestern Historical Quarterly, Letters of the "Dawson Men" from Perote Prison, Mexico, 1842-1843 (edited by L.U. Spellman).
Barkley escaped from Perote on July 2, 1843 and reached home.
At the March 24, 1843 term of the District Court of Bexar, his case was continued, presumably without any knowledge that he had died.
On March 6, 1844, the Court apparently was made aware of Dr. Booker's death in Perote Prison, and the case was again continued, to be revived in the name of the legal representatives of Dr. Booker's estate, who were at that time unknown.
Finally, at the March 6, 1845 term of court, Dr. Booker's case was dismissed because, according to the minutes of the District Court, "the Plaintiff ... failed to appear and prosecute his case."
The Order of Dismissal provided that the Defendant was allowed to recover costs of court from the Plaintiff.
Nothing was said in the official records about why Dr. Booker's case could not proceed to trial.
William Early Jones's Narrative
Washington 1 Feby 1844
Dear Sir,  In compliance with your request, I give you below, a hasty sketch of the circumstances attending the capture and imprisonment of a number of the citizens of Texas, at San Antonio de Bexar in Sept. 1842.
During the session of the District Court of Bexar County, for September 1842, a rumor reached the place that a Mexican army of from 1500 to 3000 men was on its way to attack the place.
The rumor was sufficiently authenticated to induce the belief that a force of some character was advancing, but the impression was pretty general that it was only a party of marauders and not regular troops, who were endeavoring to creat the impression that their force was much stronger than it really was, for the purpose of better enabling them to take the place without resistance and plunder it with impunity.
Col. Hays with five other well mounted men went out to make discoveries, and taking the public roads saw nothing and did not return to San Antonio until too late to enter it.
Three Mexicans were also despatched, who promised to ascertain the character of the approaching force if to be found.
They found the camp of Gen. Woll at a short distance from San Antonio; were made prisoners and not permitted to return to us.
The whole day of 10th September was thus passed and neither spies nor Mexicans returning strengthened the general belief that the rumor was either a hoax or the character of the force advancing misrepresented.
At day light on the morning of 11th Sept. we were aroused from our slumbers by the firing of a piece of cannon almost in the edge of the town, succeeded immediately by the sound of martial music and the tramp of a body of men.
A dense fog obscured them from actual observation until after they had advanced into the public square, when they were immediately fired upon by our party, who amounted to about fifty in number--the fire was soon returned by the Mexicans with volleys of musketry and rapid discharges from a six and a four pounder.
This lasted a few minutes when the fog disappearing discovered to us that we were surrounded on all sides by bodies of regular troops.
We were then called upon to surrender by order of Genl.
Woll--the firing ceased on both sides and after a parley in which the most ample pledges were given for our good treatment etc. etc. we surrendered prisoners of war, and were immediately put into prison with a strong guard over us.
General Woll had cut off all communication between the Rio Grande and Bexar, and taking a circuitous route thro' the wilderness at the foot of the Mountains had in this manner secretly advanced upon the place and was actually within three leagues of it before any suspicion was even entertained that such an expedition was contemplated.
His force was 1000 regulars and about 600 Presidial troops.
We were detained prisoners five days in San Antonio, and then ordered to march under a guard of 150 or 160 men for the Rio Grande.
Some of us by special favor permitted to ride--others from inability to walk were also allowed horses if they could get them.
In 8 days we reached the Rio Grande, a bold, rapid river two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards wide, which was crossed in two canoes.
The day was pretty much spent in getting over and we spent the night on the opposite bank.
Here we learned the death of John R. Cunningham who had been compelled to leave Bexar sick with congestif fever and had been left behind on the third day in one of the carts which conveyed the Mexicans wounded in our fight, who numbered about thirty.
Cunningham died from want of attention and were there not so many stains upon the Mexican character for other and more enormous atrocities, it would be recorded and remembered to their eternal disgrace as a nation.
We had been promised by General Woll that on our arrival at the Rio Grande, we would be released by his Superior Genl.
Reyes.
We found ourselves deceived and after a detention of seven days at San Fernando were ordered to march for the City of Mexico.
Our escort consisted of about 80 men, all mounted, who rode on each side of us while we occupied the road.
Our journes were long or short each day to suit the country thro' which we traveled, and some days we were marched from daylight until near night, making 13 and 14 leagues.
The country thro' which we travelled from San Fernando to Monclova was generally poor, broken, sometimes mountainous.
Here and there rich bodies of land susceptible of irrigation by streams from the mountains and producing corn etc. very abundantly--no timber except musquit and chaperal thickets.
From Monclova to Saltillo the character of the country was very similar, except the first two days travel was thro' a wretched barren country in which no body lived and non could live, being destitute of water.
Saltillo the capital of Cohuila is a city of 18 or 20,000 inhabitants, built after the Spanish style and here we were detained for 16 days closely housed up and never permitted to leave the Cuartel.
From Saltillo to Matahuala we passed thro' a poor and almost unpopulated country.
From Matahuala to San Luis Potosi the country is more thickly populated and in many places there are handsome estates.
San Luis Potosi is a handsome city of 40,000 inhabitants.
We were paraded through every public street in it as a show, followed by an immense crowd of people chiefly of the lower classes.
We remained here two days and were visited by the Governor and several persons of distinction in that country, besides many foreigners.
From San Luis Potosi to the City of Mexico is 300 miles.
The road passes many splendid estates the entire grounds of some of which are enclosed by stone walls beautifully constructed.
One enclossure was said to contain 36 square miles.
On arriving within twenty leagues of the City we were detained a week in a miserable prison at a place called Tula, where we were informed that our destination was not the City of Mexico, but the Castle of Perote, and that we would not be permitted to pass through the city although we should go in sight of it.
On the 22 Dec. we arrived at the Castle of Perote, a very strong fortress at the foot of the extinct Volcano called "Confra de Perote."
The Castle is on the Table Lands, just at the point at which the descent to the Gulf commences--its elevation 7500 feet--it was built in 1773--mounts 96 pieces of cannon and covers 26 acres inside of the outer pickets.
The main building within the mote covers ten acres or near it.
Well manned I should say that this fortress would resist a very powerful force.
The first four days after our arrival we were allowed to go about the castle.
On the fifth we were chained in pairs--and on the eighth or tenth day were put to work, packing sand stone lime etc. into the castle.
Our food consisted of poor beef, one day in three; beans, potatoes, rice and bread--badly cooked--the rations of these articles were always small, not being sufficient for a hearty man.
At night we were locked up--in the morning the doors were opened--at nine o'clock paraded and counted--put to work immediately afterwards--the same after dinner, etc.
On the 22 March Judge Hutchinson Mr. Maverick and myself were ordered to the City of Mexico under guard, our chains having been knocked off before we left the castle.
We were permitted to ride by paing the hire of horses; we paid also our own expenses although we were still prisoners.
This journey gave us many opportunities of witnessing the complete and perfect dominion of the military over the civil authorities.
On our arrival at the City of Mexico we were first paraded for a quarter of an hour ragged and dirty, in front of the Palace--then escorted into it and finally sent to prison.
We were however released soon after and took lodgings at the same house at which Genl.
Thompson boarded--to whom we were indebted for our liberty entirely--it having been granted as a personal favor to him.
Mr. Maverick and myself were acquainted with him in the U.S.
We remained three days in the City at perfect liberty--endeavoring to see everything to be seen in that remarkable place, in that short time.
Our passage to Vera Cruz and thence to Pensacola etc. it is unnecessary to speak of in a sketch like this.
I should have been glad had the opportunity been such as to permit the attempt, to have given you such information as I obtained in relation to the affairs of Mexico--Her government--her military organization--the church--the peon or slave system--the probable plans of Santa Anna--their views in relation to Texas; the causes of the continuance of the war--the causes of the treatment we received etc. etc. but it is useless to make the attempt here.
Many incidents and details of our journey would be interesting.
The prisoners taken at San Antonio consisted of the Judge of the District--the District Attorney, clerk--all the members of the bar except one--together with citizens of Bexar and the adjacent counties.
The names have all been published several times.

Dohäsan, Kiowa Chief
Army officer paints watercolor of Kiowa Chief
On this day in 1845, army officer and explorer James William Abert visited the village of Dohäsan in the Texas Panhandle.
Abert commanded a party of some thirty-three men assigned to explore the Canadian River region in the summer and fall of 1845.
The young lieutenant made several sketches and watercolors of activities at Bent's Fort, of native animals, and of outstanding Indians, including Dohäsan.
Dohäsan had become principal chief of the Kiowas in the spring of 1833.
His likeness was painted at least twice, by George Catlin in 1834 and by Abert in 1845.
In 1967 and 1970, the Abert journals were published under the title Through the Country of the Comanche Indians in the Fall of the Year 1845 , edited by John Galvin, a California historian.
They featured illustrations of Abert's watercolors, many of which were obtained from his descendants.

James William Abert
JAMES WILLIAM ALBERT (1820–1897).
James William Abert, army officer and explorer, was born on November 18, 1820, in Mount Holly, New Jersey, the son of Maj. John James Abert, an officer in the Corps of Topographical Engineers.
In his teens he attended Princeton University, where he graduated, probably from its academy, in 1838; he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in September of that year.
In 1842 he was assigned to the Fifth United States Infantry.
After an uneventful year of garrison duty in Detroit, Abert was transferred to the Corps of Topographical Engineers in May 1843.
His first assignment in the corps was that of assistant topographical engineer in an extensive survey of the northern lakes, 1843–44.
During that time he married Jane Stone, and they had a son.
In the summer of 1845 Abert was attached to the third expedition of John Charles Frémont, whose assignment was "to make reconnaissance southward and eastward along the Canadian River through the country of Kiowa and Comanche."
Frémont, however, chose to take his main party on to California, and gave command of the Canadian River mission to Abert, with an assistant, Lt. William G. Peck.
The legendary mountain man Thomas Fitzpatrick was employed as a guide, and Bent employees John L. Hatcher and Caleb Greenwood were hired temporarily as hunters.
Except for the two young officers, the entire party of thirty-three was composed of civilians.
The expedition struck the headwaters of the Canadian and followed it through the breaks in eastern New Mexico and into the Texas Panhandle.
Continuing along the north bank of the Canadian, Abert noted many Panhandle landmarks, including Atascosa Creek and the Alibates Flint Quarries, which he labeled Agate Bluffs.
The expedition arrived at Bent's trading house in what is now Hutchinson County on September 14, rested there for a day, and exchanged gifts with a party of Kiowas and Comancheros.
Three Kiowas had briefly joined the expedition to help keep the peace.
On September 16, after Hatcher and Greenwood had left to return to Bent's Fort, the remainder of Abert's party crossed the Canadian and turned toward the southeast.
Near the site of present Laketon, in Gray County, the party struck the North Fork of the Red River, which they mistook for the Washita and followed for a while, then turned back northeast toward the Canadian.
They crossed the present Oklahoma boundary before reaching the Canadian, which they followed to its confluence with the Arkansas.
At Fort Gibson, in eastern Indian Territory, the expedition was disbanded, and Abert and Peck went on to St. Louis.
In his report Abert described in detail the geology, flora, and fauna of the Canadian valley.
His maps of the region were the most accurate of the time, and later explorers found them quite useful, especially for finding campsites and watering places.
The abundance of wild game in the valley had kept the expedition well supplied with food.
Abert's description of the habits and customs of the Kiowa and Comanche Indians proved valuable to the federal government later.
Along with his maps and written accounts, Abert made several sketches and watercolors of activities at Bent's Fort, native animals, and outstanding Indian personalities, including the Kiowa chief Dohäsan, whose village the expedition had visited on September 17.
In the summer of 1846 Abert and Peck accompanied Gen. Stephen W. Kearny's Army of the West to New Mexico.
Abert came down with a fever in July and had to remain behind at Bent's Fort to recuperate.
While he was sick he continued his studies in natural science and ethnology and compiled a tribal dictionary.
Afterward he joined Peck in Santa Fe, and the two lieutenants conducted a thorough survey of New Mexico as far south as Socorro.
They visited each of the Rio Grande pueblos and, as before, took note of the geology and wildlife of the new American territory, as well as of the habits and customs of its native residents.
Abert then went to Washington to submit his report to Congress.
From 1848 to 1850 he served on the faculty at West Point, where he taught drawing.
He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1853 and to captain in 1856.
After the death of his first wife he married Lucy Taylor, with whom he had several children.
In 1860, after serving two years in Florida, he traveled in Europe to study military affairs and visit various forts and arsenals.
When the Civil War broke out Abert served in the Shenandoah valley from June 1861 to September 1862.
On March 3, 1863, he was promoted to major and assigned to the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
He was later severely injured by a fall from his horse, and in 1864 he resigned from the army.
He had been brevetted lieutenant colonel for his "faithful and meritorious service."
During the next five years, Abert and his family engaged in the mercantile business in Cincinnati, Ohio.
From 1869 to 1871 he served as examiner of patents in Washington.
He taught English literature at the University of Missouri from 1877 to 1879 and afterward was president of the Examining Board of Teachers of Public Schools in Kentucky.
Abert was reappointed a major in the United States Army on January 14, 1895, and retired almost immediately.
He died at his home in Newport, Kentucky, on August 10, 1897.
Despite the value of Abert's western frontier journals, they lay almost forgotten in government files until 1941, when H. Bailey Carroll first published the 1845 report in the Panhandle-Plains Historical Reviewqv.
William A. Keleher published Abert's New Mexico report in 1962.
In 1967 and 1970 special publications of the Abert journals were edited under the title Through the Country of the Comanche Indians in the Fall of the Year 1845 by John Galvin, a California historian.
They featured illustrations of Abert's watercolors, many of which were obtained from his descendants.
A species of finch that Abert discovered was named Pipilo aberti in his honor.
James William Albert
ABERT EXPEDITION
Among the reconnaissance expeditions that revealed the physical and cultural contours of the trans-Mississippi West, the 1845 venture of Lt. James W. Abert from New Mexico across Oklahoma to St. Louis, Missouri, completed an important survey of the region's resources.
Abert's expedition took place within the context of a movement for United States annexation of Texas, accomplished in December 1845 (a situation that erupted into war in 1846).
Up until that time, the best description of the United States-Mexico-Republic of Texas border region was that of Josiah Gregg in 1839-40, published in his work Commerce of the Prairies.
Abert's trip and subsequent report are judged by William Goetzmann in Army Exploration in the American West (1959) to have significantly advanced knowledge of the region for military and settlement purposes.
An 1842 West Point graduate and classmate of Ulysses S. Grant, James William Abert was the son of Maj. John J. Abert, chief of the U.S. Army Topographical Engineers.
The elder Abert planned three expeditions to reconnoiter the trans-Mississippi West in 1845.
The primary one was to be led by Capt. John C. Frémont.
Frémont's expedition included young Abert, who, at Bent's Fort in August 1845, received a separate command to explore eastward along the Canadian River in the country of the Kiowa and Comanche.
(Frémont, meanwhile, went westward to California.)
Abert's troupe left the fort on August 12 and spent the next two months marching eastward.
The renowned Indian trader Thomas "Broken Hand" Fitzpatrick guided Abert and his able assistant, Lt. William G. Peck.
Moving through New Mexico and the present Texas Panhandle and skirting the northern edge of the Llano Estacado, the party entered present Oklahoma on September 22 or 23 south of the Antelope Hills and near the Washita River, and on the twenty-fourth they went up to the main or "South" Canadian.
Thereafter, they generally followed it, camping near present Taloga, Niles, Mustang, Norman, and Noble.
They stopped near "old Fort Holmes" on October 10.
On the fifteenth they reached Edwards's Post on Little River.
They camped east of present Eufaula on the eighteenth, reached Webber's Falls on the nineteenth, and arrived at Fort Gibson on October 21.
They reached St. Louis on November 12.
Abert's report is replete with descriptions of Oklahoma's historical environment, geography, and inhabitants.
Abert's men encountered the Comanche and the Kiowa in the Texas Panhandle.
While his narrative only briefly discussed the Comanche, and somewhat derisively, he made an extensive, admiring record of the Kiowa, including his dealings with their leader Dohasan.
Abert also recorded his observations of the Creek Indians, their clothing and villages, and blacks living with them.
Abert was avidly interested in flora and fauna.
He recorded minute details of his encounters with bison (buffalo) all the way across Oklahoma to the Cross Timbers and also in present Oklahoma County.
Feral hogs bothered his men while they passed through the Creek Nation.
He saw large flocks of the now-extinct Carolina parakeet (Psittacus Carolinensis) near Webber's Falls.
He also made weather and environmental observations, describing the evidence of a tornado that had occurred years earlier near present Holdenville.
As he noted, because of "the amazing force of the whirling winds, . . . the noblest trees of the forest had fallen from their high estates, and now lay mouldering upon the ground . . . in contorted piles."
In about that same location, the expedition also traveled through a prairie fire that was burning wild.
Abert's strength was, rather than verbal description, his ability to draw.
He made extensive paintings and sketches of people, places, and animals that he saw.
Two volumes of these illustrations have been published.
An important contribution of Abert's expedition to knowledge of the region lay in its survey of the locations of wood, water, and grass, all necessary elements to any future military operations in the region.
In leading emigrants across the Indian Territory to the California gold fields in 1849, Capt. Randolph B. Marcy basically paralleled Gregg's and Abert's paths.
Marcy studied Abert's report and noted various landmarks he described, such as the Antelope Hills.
Abert's and Marcy's reports, together with Whipple's 1853 railroad survey report, indicated to federal officials that a route across Indian Territory was not viable for a transcontinental railroad.
On the other hand, the surveys revealed the Indian nations' economic resources and exploded the myth of the Great American Desert.
James William Albert
Occupation: U.S. Army officer and explorer in the American West
From: Encyclopedia of Exploration, vol.
1.
Raised in the Washington, D.C., area, James W. Abert was the son of John James Abert, who organized and was the first commander of the U.S. Army's Corps of Topographical Engineers in 1838.
Like his father, the younger Abert attended West Point.
Soon after his commission of second lieutenant in 1842, James Abert was assigned to the Corps of Topographical Engineers.
While serving, Abert was part of Colonel Stephen Watts Kearny's expedition, in the spring and summer of 1845, from Fort Leavenworth in what is now northeastern Kansas, south and west to the Santa Fe Trail and New Mexico.
Abert led a party of soldiers and topographical engineers westward across present-day Kansas, then followed the Arkansas River into present-day eastern Colorado, reaching Bent's Fort (named for William Bent), along the Arkansas River at present-day La Junta, Colorado, on August 2, 1845.
From Bent's Fort, Abert and his men explored southward into what is now western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, the domain of the Kiowa and Comanche Indians.
Abert's assignment was to produce charts of the region and provide the government with a report on these tribes.
The group then headed westward along the Santa Fe Trail into New Mexico.
While Abert was exploring and charting the Southwest, another detachment of topographical engineers under Kearny's command, led by John Charles Frémont, headed westward to explore the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Salt Lake Basin.
In 1846–47, Abert undertook several expeditions into central New Mexico, until that time rarely visited by Americans or Europeans.
In October 1846, he came upon the Acoma Pueblo of the Keres Indians, located near the headwaters of the Rio de San Jose, west of present-day Albuquerque, New Mexico.
In 1848, the U.S. Congress published Abert's account of his expeditions, entitled Report of Lieutenant James W. Abert of the Examination of New Mexico in the Years 1846–47.
Abert, an artist as well as cartographer, provided original sketches of early New Mexico scenes along with the text, including life in Kiowa, Comanche, and Pueblo Indian settlements throughout present-day Oklahoma, northern Texas, and New Mexico.
James W. Abert's explorations south and west of the Arkansas River provided some of the earliest accurate maps of the Santa Fe Trail region and proved extremely useful to Kearny and his command the following year, 1846, when Kearny led U.S. troops into New Mexico, soon after the onset of the U.S.-Mexican War of 1846–48.
DOHÄSAN (ca. 1795–1866).
Dohäsan, or Dohate, a prominent Kiowa chief, was born sometime in the mid-1790s.
He was the son of a chief named Dohá (Bluff).
He was of the Kata or Arikara band of Kiowas, so named because of their close trading relationship with the Arikaras in the upper Missouri valley during the tribe's early history.
Dohäsan's name, which was hereditary, has been variously translated as Little Mountain, Little Bluff, or Top-of-the-Mountain.
Dohäsan became principal chief of the Kiowas in the spring of 1833, after the deposition of A'date, following the massacre of his village by Osages at Cutthroat Gap, near the head of Otter Creek in Indian Territory.
That episode prompted the dragoon expedition of Col. Henry Dodge to Western Oklahoma in the summer of 1834.
Dohäsan was among those on hand to greet the colonel and his retinue.
George Catlin, who accompanied the expedition, sketched and painted the chief's portrait.
In May 1837 Dohäsan was one of the principals who signed the Fort Gibson Treaty, by which the United States government sought to end intertribal warfare in Indian Territory.
Treaties, however, did little to stifle the Kiowas' frequent raids for horses and other booty.
In 1839 he successfully led his warriors out of an ambush by Mexican soldiers at Hueco Tanks near El Paso.
In their roamings Dohäsan and his followers frequented the Texas Panhandle, particularly the Canadian River valley.
There, on September 17, 1845, he was entered in Lt. James W. Abert's watercolor portfolio.
In the summer of 1851 Dohäsan led a war party against treacherous Pawnees near the head of Medicine Lodge Creek in Kansas.
In 1859, as a goodwill gesture, Maj. John Sedgwick's troops presented Dohäsan with an old army ambulance wagon.
Unable to master the art of driving a team, the chief simply had a couple of Kiowa boys ride the harnessed horses as he sat in the driver's seat.
Once, when federal authorities threatened to withhold annuity goods and send troops against the Kiowas if they did not cease their depredations, Dohäsan defiantly called the "white chief" a fool with the "heart of a woman."
It was Dohäsan's camp that Col. Christopher H. (Kit) Carsonqv's troops attacked and burned in the first battle of Adobe Walls on November 25, 1864; the old chief escaped to warn the villages farther down but had his horse shot from under him and lost his ambulance to the whites.
In October 1865 Dohäsan signed the Little Arkansas Treaty, but he vigorously protested confinement to a reservation, declaring that the Kiowas owned all the land from the North Platte River to the upper Texas Panhandle and needed room to roam about.
Shortly afterward, in early 1866, he died.
Although the principal chieftainship passed to Lone Wolf, the Kiowa tribe began to splinter into factions and never again was truly unified under one leader.
A nephew of Dohäsan subsequently inherited his name.
The younger Dohäsan took part in many important forays and battles staged by the Kiowas.
He was part of the delegation to Washington in 1872 and participated in the Lost Valley Fight and the siege of Lyman's wagon trainqv in 1874.
He was among the last of the Kiowa leaders to surrender at the end of the Red River War in February 1875.
Afterward, the younger Dohäsan lived with his family in peace on the reservation near Fort Sill until his death.
In 1892 he gave his annual family calendar history, begun by his uncle, to Capt. Hugh L. Scott, who in turn donated it to the Smithsonian Institution.
Dohäsan the younger died in 1893.

Sam Houston and other dignitaries dedicate Monument Hill cemetery
On this day in 1848, Sam Houston and other notable Texans gathered a mile south of La Grange at Monument Hill, the chosen site for a military cemetery.
Those to be buried there had died in the Dawson Massacre and other conflicts that beset the Republic of Texas as Mexico continued to contest the fact of Texas independence.
Six years earlier, on September 18, 1842, while an army of Texans under Mathew Caldwell defeated the much larger forces of Mexican general Adrián Woll on Salado Creek near San Antonio, Capt. Nicholas Dawson and his fifty-eight volunteers fought a losing battle against 500 irregular Mexican cavalrymen and their two cannons.
The Texans were slaughtered.
A few escaped, and fifteen were carted off to Perote Prison, from where only nine survivors were eventually released.
The dead were buried in shallow graves and, in 1848, moved to Monument Hill.
The day was again solemnly commemorated ninety-one years after the massacre.
On September 18, 1933, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas dedicated a new vault at the site, which had fallen into disrepair and abuse before they moved to rescue

MONUMENT HILL-KREISCHE BREWERY STATE HISTORIC SITE.
The Monument Hill-Kreische Brewery State Historic Site is located near U.S. Highway 77 on a high bluff on the south side of the Colorado River a mile south of La Grange in central Fayette County.
In 1848 the site was chosen as a cemetery for the Texans who died in the Dawson Massacre of 1842, for the dead of the Texan Santa Fe and Mier expeditions,qqv and for those captured during Gen. Adrián Woll's raid on San Antonio.
A small tomb was built overlooking the river, and on September 18, 1848, the remains were buried there with full
military honors in a ceremony attended by Sam Houston and other dignitaries.
In January 1849 an immigrant from Saxony named Heinrich L. Kreische bought the 172 acres on the bluff, which included the gravesite.
He built a substantial home, a barn, and a smokehouse.
In 1850 he agreed to donate the tomb and ten acres surrounding it to the Texas Monumental Committee in Fayette County for $100, provided that the committee would begin work on a suitable monument within fifteen years.
No money was raised for a monument, however, and the land reverted to Kreische.
In 1860 he built a three-story building into the side of the bluff for one of the first commercial breweries in Texas.
It became the primary source of income for the family and by the time of Kreische's death in 1882 was a prosperous enterprise.
Without Kreische's leadership the business failed, and the building was abandoned.
Kreische's heirs made many requests to the state for the removal of the tomb and its contents because it attracted vandalism.
In 1907, rather than remove the tomb, the state condemned a .36-acre tract of land surrounding it.
Unfortunately, there were no attempts either to repair existing damage or to protect the site from future misuse.
In 1931 Louis W. Kemp, a member of the Texas State Historical Association, visited the site and, upset by what he found, told local reporters that he would try to have the remains moved to the State Cemetery in Austin, where they could be accorded proper respect.
Local members of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, fearful of losing the shrine, cleared the area, erected a fence, and signed a contract for a new granite vault to enclose the original.
On September 18, 1933, the ninety-first anniversary of the Dawson Massacre, the new vault was dedicated, and during the Texas Centennial celebration in 1936 the state erected an additional monument.
In 1949 the Board of Control transferred the site to the Parks Department.
In 1956 the citizens of Fayette County purchased 3.58 acres of the surrounding land and donated it to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
Meanwhile, private interests had purchased much of the surrounding Kreische land with the intention of developing a tourist attraction on the bluff and at the site of the ruined brewery.
When part of this plan failed in 1977, the state acquired thirty-six acres surrounding the monument, including the Kreische home and brewery sites, and designated them a part of the state park system.
By 1989 the two sites were operated jointly, and the 40.4-acre park provided hiking, picnicking, and an interpretive center that told the stories of both the monument and the beginnings of the Texas brewing industry.
Monument Hill
BURIAL SITE OF DAWSON & MIER CASUALTIES
LA GRANGE, FAYETTE COUNTY, TEXAS
Monument Hill
On a high bluff overlooking the Colorado River bottom in La Grange, Texas stands a tall limestone shaft.
At the base of the shaft is a gray granite crypt containing the remains of heroes of the Republic of Texas.
The following is the story of how this beautiful oak covered promontory came to be a shrine to freedom.
Twas six years since the smoke from the funeral pyre of the men of the Alamo had darkened the sky over the town of Bexar.
Mexico still refused to recognize the independence of the land north of the Rio Grande.
In September of 1842, the Mexican government sent another wall of eagles and serpents sweeping into Texas to reinforce their claim.
The force surrounded Bexar, making surrender the only viable option for the Texian officials holding court in the town later to be known as San Antonio.
When the news of the Mexican invasion reached the town of La Grange in Fayette County, the local militia, led by Nicholas Dawson, mustered under the oak tree on the town square.
About fifteen men left the square on horseback and crossed the Colorado riding towards Bexar.
Along the way, Dawson enlisted men until a total of fifty-three men arrived at Salado Creek a few miles northeast of the Alamo.
Dawson’s party had traveled one hundred miles in just under two days, quite a feat at that time.
Their horses were exhausted and the men had dismounted to prepare for battle.
A Mexican patrol discovered Dawson, split into two pincers and surrounded the small band of Texians.
At the center of the Mexican force were two cannon loaded with grape and canister shot.
As Mexican lead poured into the Texians, more than half their number fell in the first few minutes.
Seeing only two choices, death or surrender, Dawson surrendered.
The silence of death and the cries of the men on the verge of death filled the air.
The dead thirty-eight Texian heroes were left for the scavengers as the Mexican army headed back to the border.
Fifteen men from Dawson’s command and the captives from Bexar courtroom were with them.
Other companies of militia from Fayette County arrived too late to assist Dawson.
Captain William M. Eastland, Dawson’s cousin, commanded one of the militia units.
The dead were buried on the banks of the Salado where they had fallen.
The militia units returned to their homes to mourn their dead and plan their revenge.
Retribution began in November of 1842, when a group of 750 men left Bexar to avenge the death of their neighbors and relatives.
Freezing weather, desertion, and the sacking of Laredo by the Texian force soon forced the Texian commander to order a return to Bexar and disband.
Those still seeking revenge elected officers who wished to carry on.
On Christmas Day, a force of 261 men crossed the Rio Grande and attacked the town of Mier.
Once again, a larger Mexican force surrounded the town, causing the Texians to surrender, mistakenly figuring they would be treated as prisoners of war and released.
The Mexican government viewed the Texians as a band of rebels, and it was decided to march the able bodied prisoners deep into Mexico and imprison them.
Enroute, the Texians made numerous plans to escape that culminated in a mass breakout at the Hacienda Salado on February 11, 1843.
After escaping the Hacienda, the Texians then broke into groups trying to return to Texas.
The harsh terrain caused the majority to be recaptured.
Three men managed to walk the three hundred mile trip to Texas.
Two of these men were Fayette County men.
To teach the unruly Texian rebels a lesson, President Santa Anna ordered that the men be decimated.
Decimation, a Latin word meaning to select one out of ten, has been used by armies since the time of Julius Caesar.
One tenth of the 176 Texian rebels would be executed by firing squad.
A death lottery was organized, and an earthen jar was filled with one hundred fifty nine white beans and seventeen black beans.
The prisoners were lined up to draw their own fate.
Drawing a black bean meant death.
All the officers drew first, and all drew a white bean with the exception of Captain Eastland, Dawson’s cousin from La Grange.
The Captain was the first man to draw a black bean.
The enlisted men then drew the rest of the beans.
The executions were carried out with full military ceremony.
The bodies were left in a pile for four days before being moved to the nearest cemetery in the town of Cedral.
The surviving prisoners of what became known as the Mier Expedition were marched to Perote Prison near Mexico City where they met the Bexar/Dawson prisoners that were still alive.
Utilizing various methods such as escape, bribery, foreign intervention, death and the “generosity” of Santa Anna, all of the men had left Perote Prison by September 16, 1844 and returned north of the Rio Grande.
After the annexation of Texas by the United States, a border dispute triggered the Mexican-American War.
The Texians once again had their opportunity to seek revenge upon Mexico.
Hundreds of Texians volunteered for service in the American army.
After the American invasion force had pacified the Mexican Army, a regiment of Texian Rangers under Major Walter P. Lane were stationed near Hacienda Salado and the town of Cedral.
One of the Mier Expedition survivors, Captain Dusenberry asked permission to take a detail into Cedral and retrieve the bones of his comrades.
Lane could not officially authorize such a violation of the truce; he just merely ignored the request.
A troop of Texians left under the cover of darkness with at least three Fayette County men in the small troop.
They brazenly entered the town and impressed several “volunteers” to commence digging in the graveyard under the complaints of the priest.
The bones were excavated and packed into four boxes and strapped to mules.
By this time, the Mexican cavalry had been alerted and the Texians beat a hasty retreat back to their lines with a Mexican patrol in pursuit.
The boxes were returned to Texas and stored in the Fayette County courthouse.
La Grange was chosen as the final resting place of the Mier men, to honor the only officer and first man to draw a black bean which sealed his fate, Captain William Mosby Eastland.
The return of the remains galvanized the community to retrieve the bones of Dawson’s men and a citizens’ group brought the bleached bones back to La Grange from the banks of the Salado.
Veterans and citizens held meetings and decided to entomb the men on the commanding bluff to the south of La Grange.
On September 18, 1848, a somber procession left the town square where six years before, Nicholas Dawson had hastily assembled a squad of men to protect their families and rode off into history.
A befitting ceremony was held with proper respect being rendered.
At first, a simple sandstone vault was the tomb of these patriots.
A committee was organized to raise money for a more befitting monument.
The Monumental Committee decided upon starting a newspaper to fund a proper monument.
The paper existed for four years during which its purpose shifted from funding a monument to the Dawson and Mier men, to a monument to all Texas heroes to establishing a “Monumental College”.
The Texas Monument paper failed because in the hope of attracting money, its editorial policy limited news that would not offend any potential donor.
So the heroes of Texas remained in their crude sandstone crypt on the bluff overlooking La Grange.
When the decision to bury the men on the bluff was made, the burial plot was on a league granted in1832 to David Berry.
David Berry was over seventy years old when he joined Dawson’s band and was killed at Salado Creek.
The land went through several owners.
When H.L. Kreische purchased the land, the burial plot was not reserved on the deed.
In 1850, to correct the oversight he offered to sell 10 acres surrounding the tomb under certain conditions to which the Monumental Committee consented.
The conditions being that when a cornerstone was laid, he would be paid one hundred dollars.
However, if nothing occurred in fifteen years the deed was null and void.
The Monumental Committee folded and in1857, Kreische built his house adjacent to the tomb and claimed the land in 1865.
In 1904, the Kreische descendants, tired of unfulfilled promises by numerous groups to maintain the crypt, demanded the removal of the vault and its contents.
They supposedly threatened to throw the remains over the bluff into the river if action wasn’t taken quickly.
This drastic measure prompted the Daughters of the Republic of Texas chapter in La Grange to contact the state government and the land was purchased for $350.
In the early 1930s, when a state official visited the site with the purpose of moving the remains to the new state cemetery in Austin, it was surrounded by a rusty, neglected barbed wire fence.
A tree growing out of the side floor of the tomb with cactus and other plants growing indiscriminately around it showed the neglect.
Before leaving La Grange, the official mentioned that the remains were to be relocated to Austin.
This announcement spurred the creation of the Monument Hill Memorial Association.
When the state returned to begin the move it found that “the ground around the vault cleared off clean as a whistle...the cracked walls repaired and an iron fence with a concrete curb erected around it.”
Within two months a fitting granite cover was built over the old sandstone tomb.
The 1936 Centennial was a boon for Texas history as the state spent large amounts of money to honor and preserve its heritage.
Ten thousand dollars was appropriated for a monument to be placed next to the tomb.
The forty foot shaft with the bronze angel at the base was soon completed on the small plot.
In 1957, Fayette County residents raised money to purchase the 3.54 acres around the tomb and donated the land to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to use as a state park.
Today, Monument Hill-Kreische Brewery State Historical Site contains the tomb, monument, and a historically accurate mural of the execution of the Mier men.
Footprints of Fayette article submitted by Carolyn Heinsohn:
Black Beans of Death
The following article by an unknown author was published in The La Grange Journal on November 15, 1928.
In addition to a descriptive account of the massacre of the seventeen Mier prisoners who drew black beans at Salado, Mexico, the article also includes a first-person account by Franciska Willrich Vogt, who at age 13 witnessed the burial of their remains in 1848 on the bluff south of La Grange.
It is a cold, gloomy day in March of 1843.
A dismal wind startles weird echoes in the trees and canons of mountainous country near Salado, Mexico—rising in the mountains and sweeping with vicious insistence down to the little settlement where one hundred and seventy-six men are doomed to die.
In their hearts there is little hope of release.
They sit in the stifling air of a rude shed, converted into a death chamber from a barn, and wait orders to march before a firing line and surrender their lives for Texas.
Awaiting the surrender of their all—these who had scorned all other surrender as not befitting men who had sworn themselves to win freedom for their state.
Their clothes were worn threadbare, their feet were sore and lacerated from those long days and nights on the mountains without food or shelter while they sought the way back to Texas.
Bodies were weak and helpless from the long exposure and in their minds was no thought but the release death would bring.
In the hands of the Mexican general Santa Anna they hoped for no mercy.
Guards enter the room and silently place the men in heavy iron chains, ordering each to stand in line as he was bound.
No word is said—then one of the Mexicans holds an official looking document to the light and reads orders that chill the blood of every man who heard them.
They had expected death—death for them all according to the will of Santa Anna.
Their capturer, General Mexia, had written his relentless commander, asking freedom for the prisoners, and Santa Anna had granted that only one man out of every ten would be shot and that the others might be spared.
In the history of Texas is written many chapters of dramatic happenings, but none more powerful in ironic twists of fate than the scene that followed the reading of the cruel orders.
An officer, holding an earthen mug in his hand, comes into the shed where the Texans were confined and bound in chains.
In the mug were one hundred and seventy-six beans, the number of the prisoners.
One hundred and fifty-nine beans were white and seventeen were black.
The prisoners were each to draw a bean from the mug.
The black beans meant death.
To tell the rest would be only to repeat a story known to all Texans, for the destiny of the Mier prisoners—men who dared to enter the enemy’s country out-numbered many times, to save their comrades captured by General Woll at San Antonio—will be retold and remembered through many generations.
It is from the lips of Mrs. Franciska Vogt of La Grange that the story was recently recounted with a new and gripping angle on the well known incidents—for Mrs. Vogt is the one person living who was present and remembers when the bones of these seventeen men were brought back to Texas soil and buried on the bluff overlooking her home in La Grange.
And it was on her 93rd birthday that she recalled that solemn ceremony of 1848, when as a child of 13 she rode bareback to the site where the Mier prisoners were re-buried with honor and praise.
“Ah, I shall never forget how it looked— that procession of men riding mules and leading others with the bones of the Texans slung in gunny-sacks across the backs of the animals,” she said, her eyes once more glowing with the amazement she must have felt as a child.
“They came right into town, and when I heard what was going to be done, I remember I ran and jumped on my pony and raced to the top of the hill for the ceremony.”
“I do not remember much of what happened, except that it was all very solemn and quiet as the bones were carefully and tenderly buried up there on the hill.
Then the monument was put up—the big limestone tomb under which are the remains of those seventeen men who drew the black beans of death.”
Mrs. Vogt recalled that she was unable to get astride her horse after it was all over – remembering, as she says, more of the smaller details that made an impression on a young mind.
“I know it was some man from Austin who helped me – some nice man who held my horse and helped me swing up to ride back home again, but I do not know who, though I still remember how he looked that day,” she said.
The little old lady who will soon reach the century mark also told the story of the man who took the black bean drawn by a comrade away from him and died in his stead.
The incident may be legend or true, but Mrs. Vogt states that she has heard it all her life and believes its veracity.
It is told that the first to draw the fatal lot was a man with a wife and children back at home, and that his friend forced him to exchange the beans so that he might live.
Though the names of this Damon and Pythias of Texas history may be lost in the maze of years, what a monument to friendships that face life and death with equal unselfishness!
The burial of the Mier prisoners is only one of the incidents of early Texas history that can be told in the first person by the gray-haired and smiling grandmother and great-grandmother of La Grange.
She came to Fayette County from Germany in 1847 with her mother and brothers and sisters, following the father George Willrich, who had come the previous year and located a home.
Mrs. Vogt tells that the state gave 300 acres of land to every man with a family who settled in that country then – land as wild as if it had never been touched by man.
“These hills were thick with wild animals and rattle snakes, but I got used to them and remember riding all over the country by myself as a child,” she relates.
“I will always remember one time when I was going after the horses for my mother and came up on a lot of commotion in the woods.
When I got to a clearing, I saw six wolves tearing at the body of a deer they had killed.”
Mrs. Vogt’s father was a prominent judge in the “old country,” and came to America with many other immigrants during those years who sought freedom and prosperity in the new land.
He had a large family of children whose children and children’s children are numbered among the settlers of the state.
Mrs. Vogt’s own children are Mrs. Ernest Knigge of La Grange, with whom she makes her home; E. R. Vogt of Schulenburg, Julius Vogt of O’Quinn, Mrs. Fritz Nollkamper, Fritz Vogt, La Grange.
The story of the Mier prisoners will again be placed before the people of Texas during the next legislature, it was recently learned, as the senator and representative from that part of the state, Senator Gus.
Rusek of Schulenburg and Rep. James Pavlica of Flatonia, are to ask that 50 acres of land along the top of the bluff where the men are buried, be purchased by the state for a state park and a memorial to their heroism.
The land is available for purchase at this time, and as the location is ideal scenically for a beautiful recreation resort, they will use all their power to pass the bill creating the Mier park for Texas.
A monument already stands on the court house square at La Grange, erected several years ago by the state “to the memory of the men who drew the black beans and were shot at Salado, Mexico, on March 24th, 1843,” and to Capt. N. H. Dawson and his men who were massacred at Salado, Texas, in September of 1842.
The remains of some of these men are also said to rest with the Mier prisoners in the tomb at La Grange, brought back by the group who went by mule train on their errand of such grim homage.
To follow the trail of these one hundred and fifty-six men who were spared in the fatal lottery at the haciendo of Salado would be to wonder whether or not the man who saved his friend did not leave him the worse fate.
Dying of unbearable hardships on their march into Mexico City, wasting away in dungeons, shot while trying to escape and a few finally winning their way back to Texas, the group one by one went the way of their comrades who drew death from the glass of chance that day.
But no matter what followed for them, it would surely be safe to imagine that none experienced deeper agony of suspense, or grief for his comrades, than when they plunged their hands into the little grains of matter, colored black and white, that meant a promised freedom or a black doom.
Monument Hill Tomb
In September 1848, the remains of Texans killed in the 1842 Dawson Massacre and the 1843 "Black Bean Death Lottery" were reburied at this site in a sandstone vault.
The Kreische family did its best to care for the grave during their ownership of the property, but it suffered from lack of formal oversight.
In 1905, the state authorized acquisition of .36 acres here, and the Daughters of the Republic of Texas raised funds for a new cover for the tomb in 1933.
During the 1936 Texas Centennial celebration, the 48-foot shellstone shaft with a stylized, Art Deco-influenced mural was erected to mark the mass grave more prominently.
Local citizens purchased 3.54 acres as a donation to the state for parkland in 1957.

Forerunner of Bergstrom Air Force Base is activated near Austin
On this day in 1942, Del Valle Army Air Base was activated.
The facility was constructed on 3,000 acres of land donated by the city of Austin.
It was renamed Bergstrom Field on November 11, 1943, in honor of Capt. John A. Bergstrom, the first Austinite killed in World War II.
In 1948 the name was changed to Bergstrom Air Force Base.
The base closed on September 30, 1993.
The land was returned to the city of Austin, and in May of 1999 Austin-Bergstrom International Airport was opened on the site and Robert Mueller Municipal Airport was closed.

Another chapter in Texas History
BERGSTROM AIR FORCE BASE.
Bergstrom Air Force Base, on State Highway 71 seven miles east of Austin in Travis County, was activated on September 19, 1942, as Del Valle Army Air Base.
It was constructed in the summer of 1942 on 3,000 acres leased from the city of Austin.
The Chisholm Trail ran through the tract.
The name of the base was changed to Bergstrom Army Air Field on March 3, 1943, in honor of Capt. John A. E. Bergstrom, who was killed at Clark Field, Philippine Islands, on December 8, 1941.
He was the first Austinite killed in World War II.
The base was renamed Bergstrom Field on November 11, 1943, and became Bergstrom Air Force Base in December 1948.
Initially, Bergstrom was the home of troop-carrier units.
It was declared a permanent base after World War II and was at various times assigned to the Strategic Air Command and the Tactical Air Command.
After July 1966 it was under the control of the Tactical Air Command and housed the headquarters for the Twelfth Air Force, which was responsible for all Tactical Air Command reconnaissance, fighter, and airlift operations west of the Mississippi River.
The economic contribution of the base in fiscal 1989 on a fifty-mile radius was estimated to be $343 million and on Central Texas, $533 million.
On September 30, 1993, Bergstrom was officially closed.
That year voters approved a bond issue for the construction of an Austin airport at the base.
SAC Bases:  Bergstrom Air Force Base
Location: Texas
Home of:  340th Bomb Wing,  4130th Strategic Wing
Status:  Now the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport
The Air Force-Austin partnership began in 1942 when Austin purchased land for the Del Valle Army Air Base.
Before giving the land to the federal government, the city stipulated that should the military vacate the property, the property could revert to the city.
In 1948, Lyndon B. Johnson, then a US representative from Texas, petitioned Congress to rename the installation for Capt. John Austin Earl Bergstrom, the first native of Austin to die in World War II.
In the 1950s the Strategic Air Command based the 12th Strategic Fighter Wing and the 27th Fighter Escort Wing at Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas.
These units provided fighter escort, air defense for SAC bomber forces from 1950 through 1957.
In l950, the 524th fighter escort squadron flying the F-84 went to Taegu Air Base, Korea, where they served in combat until moving to Bergstrom AFB, Texas, in mid l95l.
In l953, the unit was redesignated as the 524th Strategic Fighter Squadron and then the 524th Fighter Bomber Squadron in l957.
That same year F-101s replaced the F-84s and the unit was redesignated the 524th Tactical Fighter Squadron a year later.
Subsequently, Tactical Air Command's Twelfth Air Force was headquartered at Bergstrom, as was the TAC 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing.
Bergstrom was included on the 1991 list of military installations to close in 1993 by the base realignment and closure process.
Austin saw this as a solution to its major dilemma of how and where to replace the municipal airport.
After years of complaints from local residents about noise pollution from low flying aircraft, the City of Austin decided to construct a new airport.
As city officials continued their search for a new site for the airport, Bergstrom Air Force Base (AFB), located inside Austin city limits, was placed on the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) list.
The city quickly realized that Bergstrom AFB was the ideal location for Austin's new airport.
Bergstrom AFB was placed on a very strict restoration schedule in order to open the airport within the time frame required by the city.
The Austin-Bergstrom International Airport project is the largest construction project in Texas in 20 years.
Cargo operations began at the airport in 1997, and have expanded to include two additional carriers.
Dual runways allow for simultaneous takeoffs and landings.
The old Bergstrom runway D, at 12,500 feet long, is named the Lyndon B. Johnson Memorial Runway.
Johnson landed on this runway when he visited his home in Texas and considered Bergstrom his home base.
The second and shorter 9000-feet runway is dedicated to former U.S. representative from Texas, J. J. "Jake" Pickle.
Pickle insisted that the new airport have two runways running separate and parallel.
The new terminal building memorializes former U.S. representative from Texas Barbara Jordan.
Anticipated growth in the local area prompted the city to expand the number of terminal gates to 25, with the capacity to expand to 55.
Austin expects to have 16,000 new jobs associated with the airport by 2012 and more than 725,000 square feet of new development drawn to the surrounding area.

Hurricane Beulah wracks Texas coast
On this day in 1967, Hurricane Beulah, the third largest hurricane of the twentieth century, struck South Texas.
It battered the state for two days.
The storm hit Brownsville with winds estimated at 140 miles an hour, moved northwest across South Texas to the vicinity of Alice, then turned southwest, crossed the Rio Grande between Zapata and Laredo, and finally blew itself out in Mexico.
Tornadoes spawned by Beulah did extensive damage to South Texas and northeast Mexico.
On September 28, President Johnson declared twenty-four counties in South Texas a disaster area.
Official estimates in these counties set the number of dead at 18, the injured or sick at 9,000, and the number of homes destroyed or heavily damaged at 3,000.
Property damage was estimated at $100 million, crop damage at $50 million.
Some 300,000 people were evacuated during the storm and subsequent flooding.

Hurricane Beulah - September 8-24, 1967
Beulah intially developed into a tropical depression on the 5th as is was approaching the Lesser Antilles.
It
strengthened into a tropical storm in the eastern Caribbean Sea on the 7th, becoming a hurricane late on the 8th
as it tracked westward.
Strengthening continued into the 10th before the storm approached and interacted with the
mountanous island of Hispanola.
Below is a map showing the rainfall in Puerto Rico as Beulah passed by to the
south, constructed using data from the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina.
Moving across the western Caribbean as now a tropical storm, it slowly restrengthened into a hurricane, crossing
over the Yucatan peninsula on a west-northwest track on the 15th.
The track bent more to the north, moving
north-northwest at 10 mph across the southern Gulf of Mexico.
It deepened into a potent hurricane until it hit
the continental shelf, then weakened slowly as it moved west and southwest through southern Texas.
It
produced a record number of tornadoes, with some counting as many as 146 separate event in this storm,
making it the most tornadic producing storm on record for the United States.
Winds gusted to 136 mph on
the S.S. Shirley Lykes in the Port of Brownsville, with the Brownsville Weather Office recording gusts to 109
mph...their winds could have been higher since it was noted after the storm that their anemometer took on a 30
degree tilt during its fury.
The graphics below show the storm total rainfall for Beulah, using data from the
National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina and Comision Nacional del Agua, the parent
agency of Mexico's national weather service.
Note the maximum across southern Texas...where Pettus
received over 27 inches of rain, most likely due to the shifting of the track from north-northwest to south,
which allowed rain bands to become essentially stationary across Bee county, Texas.

Future missionary ordained
On this day in 1826, Richard Salmon was ordained an Episcopal priest in New York, after two years as a deacon.
He suffered from tuberculosis and, unsuccessful at ministry in the East, determined to take a colony of church members to Texas.
But he also failed at the rare calling of clergyman-empresario, for his colony, already drastically reduced, disintegrated immediately upon arrival in Velasco in October 1836.
Nevertheless, Salmon became the first Episcopal priest to minister canonically and regularly in Texas.
He was one of two chaplains of the Texas Senate in the First Congress of the republic, and he officiated at Stephen F. Austin's funeral.
After a long illness and a short stint as principal of the Houston city school, he returned to New York in 1840.
In July 1849 he died of cholera on a steamboat near Baton Rouge while on his way back to Texas.

Another chapter in Texas History
RICHARD SALMON (1797–1849).
Richard Salmon, Episcopalian priest and colonizer, was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1797, the son of Richard Salmon.
He received B.A. and M.A. degrees from Hobart College, Geneva, New York, and studied theology at General Theological Seminary, New York City.
He was made deacon in the Protestant Episcopal church on September 21, 1823, and ordained priest on September 21, 1826.
For twelve years he served parishes in western New York.
Under the pen name Pioneer, he contributed articles to the Gospel Messenger.
He was a consumptive and unsuccessful in his New York ministry.
With plans to take a colony of church people to Texas he assembled fifty married mechanics and farmers with their families, who were prepared to leave in November 1834; but funds were insufficient, and thirty-five families withdrew.
On November 28, 1835, Stephen F. Austin and Samuel May Williams agreed to accept fifteen New York families to be sent by John White to Texas.
On February 15, 1836, White granted half interest in the contract to Salmon, who left New York with fifteen families on February 24, 1836.
After learning of Antonio López de Santa Anna's incursion into Texas, Salmon and his colonists remained in New Orleans until October, when they went to Velasco.
The colony disintegrated immediately.
Salmon was the first Episcopal priest to minister canonically and regularly in Texas.
He served as one of the two chaplains of the Senate for the first session of the First Congress and officiated at the funeral of Stephen F. Austin.
For two years he was sick and did little active work, but on February 11, 1839, the Houston city school opened with him as principal.
He resigned on January 20, 1840, after an investigation by the board of aldermen, returned to New York, and, while on his way back to Texas, died of cholera aboard a steamboat near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in July 1849.
His widow, Delia (Smith), and his son, Granger, later lived in Wise County.

There were members of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of America in Mexican Texas, but because the laws under which they had been granted land demanded allegiance to the Catholic Church, they could not practice their faith openly.
During the Texas Revolution Rev. Richard Salmon of New York state headed a colony of Episcopal people who intended to settle on lands that Salmon believed to have been granted to him, but the land grant was found to be spurious.
Salmon established schools at Brazoria and Houston, but was not accepted as an Episcopal clergyman by the members of the church there.
Chester Newell, another Episcopal clergyman, moved to Texas and taught school at Velasco.
Both Salmon and Newell applied to the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Episcopal Church for appointment as foreign missionaries but were not accepted.
In 1838 two clergymen were invited to open schools in the new Republic of Texas and had promise of full support from teaching.
Rev. Caleb Smith Ives conducted the first service in Matagorda at Christmas 1838 and reported the organization of the first Episcopal church in Texas, Christ Church, Matagorda, on January 27, 1839.
Rev. R. S. Chapman began holding services at Houston, Galveston, Velasco, and Quintana.
Christ Church, Houston, was organized on March 16, 1839.
Episcopal oversight for the Texas mission was provided when Rev. Leonidas Polk of Tennessee was elected missionary bishop of the Southwest in 1838; Polk visited the missionary stations in May 1839.
He reported that a resident bishop was needed.
Chapman remained in Texas only seven months and was replaced by Rev. Benjamin Eaton, an Irishman, who arrived in January 1841 and organized Trinity Church in Galveston in February 1841.
Another missionary, Rev. Charles Gillette, was appointed to Houston.
He was asked to solicit money to restore the Galveston building before journeying to Texas, and in this he succeeded.
In Houston, the Christ Church congregation purchased the land on which the present cathedral is located and moved an unused school building on it to serve as church and school until funds were available to build a church.
Christ Church, Matagorda, meanwhile, had put up a ready-cut church that Ives purchased with funds he had solicited in the eastern United States; the building was shipped to Matagorda in pieces.
It has been blown down by hurricanes several times and as often rebuilt on the same plan.
Christ Church is the mother church of Texas Episcopalians.
At the General Convention of 1844 Rev. George Washington Freeman of Delaware was elected missionary bishop of the Southwest, with provisional care over the church in the Republic of Texas.
When Texas was annexed to the United States in 1846, the Episcopal churches in Texas came under the care of the Domestic Committee of the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the American church.
On January 1, 1849, the Diocese of Texas was organized at a meeting in Christ Church, Matagorda.
Other congregations were organized, and Gillette founded St. Paul's School and College, a diocesan school.
He used candidates for the ministry as tutors while he instructed them for ordination.
Although the school was short-lived, many of the students became missionaries throughout Texas.
On October 13, 1859, Rev. Alexander Gregg, rector of St. David's Church, Cheraw, South Carolina, was consecrated as bishop of Texas.
So great was the growth that the diocese petitioned the General Convention of 1871 to separate out a missionary area.
In 1874 two missionary areas were provided.
The Diocese of Texas was limited in area to the fifty-seven counties of Southeast Texas, while North and West Texas were made missionary districts.
After the separation of the two missionary districts, the Diocese of Texas prospered.
New work under Gregg's episcopate included missions for blacks in Galveston and Tyler, and urban missions in Galveston, Houston, and Austin; elsewhere missions were established along new rail lines as they were being constructed, and in lumbering communities.
Upon Gregg's death on July 10, 1893, Rev. George Herbert Kinsolving of Philadelphia became the second bishop of Texas.
He focused on work among students at the University of Texas, where under his jurisdiction Grace Hall and All Saints' Chapel were built.
Grace Hall was built as a home for girls attending the university, and included provision for instruction in subjects not offered at the university.
Kinsolving also emphasized missionary work and traveled over the diocese.
In 1918 Rev. Clinton Simon Quin was elected coadjutor bishop.
His greatest contributions were in the areas of men's and young peoples' work.
He was the first to employ summer youth camps, and he promoted youth groups in all congregations in the diocese.
Bishop Kinsolving died in September 1928, after which Quin became the third bishop of Texas.
The outbreak of World War II, which brought the establishment or enlargement of numerous military facilities, increased the work load for Bishop Quin, and in 1945 Rev. John Elbridge Hines, rector of Christ Church, Houston, was elected coadjutor.
In 1956 Hines became the fourth bishop of Texas.
He made his headquarters in Austin.
During this time St. Luke's Hospital and the diocesan headquarters building were constructed in Houston, and St. Stephen's Episcopal School and the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest were established in Austin, and Christ Church, Houston, was designated the cathedral of the diocese.
By 1964 St. Luke's Hospital, in partnership with Children's Hospital, was greatly enlarged in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, and both St. Stephen's School and the seminary carried out large building programs to accommodate enlarged enrollments.
The debt of the diocese became threatening to the progress of missionary work during this time of social unrest, in which racial barriers were removed in the diocese.
At the 1964 General Convention of the Episcopal Church, Bishop Hines was elected its presiding bishop, and Rev. James Milton Richardson, dean of Christ Church Cathedral, Houston, was elected to replace him.
Richardson set his priorities to include payment of the debts of the diocese and its institutions, which he accomplished well before his death in 1980.
When he died, Rev. Maurice Manuel Benitez, rector of St. John the Divine Church in Houston, became sixth bishop of Texas.
In 1986 the Episcopal Diocese of Texas had a clergy staff of 276, 104 parish churches, 52 mission congregations, and 76,975 baptized members; it was numerically one of the largest dioceses in the Episcopal Church in the United States, and it is one of the largest contributors to the missionary and social work of that church.
In 1995 the Diocese of Texas had 158 congregations with a total membership of 74,000 and clergy numbering 318, 81 of whom were retired and 27 of whom were women.
The Missionary District of Northern Texas was defined in 1874 as that area lying west of the boundaries of Marion, Harrison, Gregg, and Smith Counties to the New Mexico line, and north to the Oklahoma line, and following the northern boundary of Texas to the western boundary of Marion County.
The convention elected Rev. Alexander Charles Garrett to be the missionary bishop of northern Texas.
The district had four self-supporting parishes-at Cleburne, Dallas, Paris, and Sherman.
Garrett designated St. Matthew's Church, Dallas, as his cathedral.
By 1895 the district had enough strength to become a diocese.
The Diocese of Dallas was formed with twenty-one clergy, fourteen parishes, twenty-nine missions, and 2,321 communicants.
In 1910 the Missionary District of Northern Texas was separated from the dioceses of Dallas and West Texas.
The Very Rev. Harry Tunis Moore, Dean of St. Matthew's Cathedral in Dallas, was elected coadjutor bishop of Dallas in 1917, at which time Garrett turned over the administration of the diocese to him.
In 1982, by action of the General Convention, the Diocese of Fort Worth was separated from the Diocese of Dallas.
It comprises Wichita, Archer, Young, Stephens, Eastland, Brown, Mills, Hamilton, Comanche, Erath, Somervell, Palo Pinto, Jack, Clay, Montague, Wise, Parker, Hood, Bosque, Hill, Johnson, Tarrant, and Cooke counties, and that part of Dallas County within the city of Grand Prairie.
In 1995 the Diocese of Dallas had sixty-nine parishes and six missions, all served by eighty-five ministers.
Another twenty-five licensed clergy served in the diocese as chaplains, assistant clergy, and heads of schools.
The estimated membership of the diocese in 1995 was around 40,000.
The missionary jurisdiction of Western Texas, set apart by the General Convention of 1874, was bounded on the east by the western boundaries of counties crossed by the Colorado River (Matagorda, Wharton, Colorado, Fayette, Bastrop, and Travis), on the north by the northern county lines of Caldwell, Blanco, Llano, San Saba, McCulloch, Concho, Tom Green, and El Paso counties as then constituted, on the southwest along the Rio Grande to the Gulf, then northeast along the coast to the western boundary of Matagorda County.
Most of the territory west of San Antonio was Indian country, traveled only with armed escort.
Indianola and Port Lavaca were seaports from which goods were transported inland, mostly by wagontrain.
Churches north and westward of these were at Victoria, Chocolate, Cuero, Goliad, Gonzales, Luling, Lockhart, San Marcos, Seguin, and San Antonio.
At Corpus Christi and Rockport were the only other churches along the Gulf Coast except for that in distant and isolated Brownsville.
Westward, El Paso was separated from all the rest by deserts and mountains, with only a few army posts in between.
Army chaplains assigned to some posts kept the witness of the church alive in their environs.
As missionary bishop of Western Texas the General Convention elected Rev. Robert Woodward Barnwell Elliott, rector of St. Philip's Church, Atlanta, Georgia.
After his consecration in Atlanta, he made San Antonio his headquarters and named St. Mark's Church there his cathedral.
In the thirteen years of Elliott's episcopate a great deal of progress was made.
Three additional churches were founded in San Antonio: St. Luke's in a new suburb on San Pedro Creek, St. John's as an outgrowth of a Sunday school and free dispensary to minister to the poor, and St. Paul's adjacent to Fort Sam Houston.
Great effort was devoted to education.
Elliott refounded St. Mary's Hall, San Antonio, which had been established by Bishop Gregg in 1865 but lost because of financial difficulties during Reconstruction.
Because Seguin had no public school, by popular demand a day school for boys, St. Andrew's Academy, and a school for girls, Montgomery Academy, were established there.
To succeed Elliott the General Convention elected Rev. James Steptoe Johnston, rector of Trinity Church, Mobile, Alabama.
He took hold of the still-pioneer work with a will, and was as energetic a traveler as his predecessor in visiting the scattered members of the West Texas congregations.
In 1895 the General Convention added Texas west of the Pecos River to the Missionary District of New Mexico and Arizona.
St. Clement's, El Paso, by that time a strong parish, was thus lost to West Texas but furnished a fine measure of strength to the other jurisdiction.
A new work with African Americans was begun in 1896, when a group from a black Protestant congregation applied to Johnston to take them under his care.
The convocation of that year admitted them under the name St. Philip's Mission, and a building formerly occupied by the German Methodist Church on Villita Street in San Antonio was bought for them.
The bishop also sponsored a school to teach industrial arts to girls on the premises; this institution later became St. Philip's College.
The district became the Diocese of West Texas in 1904, and Johnston became its first bishop.
The strength of the diocese was heavily concentrated in San Antonio.
In 1910, when the Missionary District of Northern Texas was being planned, West Texas offered to cede eleven counties to the new jurisdiction: Coke, Sterling, Glasscock, Midland, Ector, Winkler, Loving, Ward, Crane, Upton, and Reagan.
The General Convention accepted the offer.
In 1913 the San Angelo congregation petitioned to be added to Northern Texas, and Tom Green and Irion counties were ceded to that missionary district.
In 1914 Rev. William Theodotus Capers, rector of Holy Apostles' Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was elected coadjutor bishop.
He was consecrated at the 1914 diocesan council in San Antonio.
Bishop Johnston turned over the administration of the diocese to Capers immediately and announced his intention to resign at the coming general convention.
Capers placed the affairs of the diocese on a businesslike basis.
He had an office with a secretary, an amenity his predecessors never had, and turned over much of the routine business to an archdeacon.
Military installations that sprang up in the diocese during World War I, and the development of the Winter Garden Region and the citrus fruit culture of the Rio Grande valley stimulated church development.
By 1944 there were twenty-six military facilities in the diocese, including the Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi.
Capers carried on a vigorous program of missionary advance, at the same time ministering to the physical and spiritual well-being of his clergy.
In 1943 Everett Jones was consecrated bishop.
The educational work of the diocese was strengthened under Bishop Jones.
St. Philip's College was taken over by the San Antonio public schools.
St. Mary's Hall, once again well housed and financially cared for, continued its services for girls.
Texas Military Instituteqv, once lost to the diocese under its former name, came back under diocesan ownership.
Under Jones's leadership the diocese determined to reverse the decline in rural and small-town work.
In 1968 Rev. Harold C. Gosnell, rector of St. Mark's Church, San Antonio, was elected bishop of West Texas.
He was succeeded in 1977 by the Right Rev. Scott Field Bailey.
The entire Panhandle and High Plains region of Texas was included in the Missionary District of Northern Texas and the Diocese of Dallas in 1874, and continued as part of the Diocese of Dallas from 1896 to 1910.
In 1910, when the Missionary District of Northern Texas was separated from the Diocese of Dallas, Rev. Edward Arthur Temple, rector of St. Paul's Church, Waco, was elected the first missionary bishop of northern Texas.
Temple called Rev. Eugene Cecil Seamanqv to be archdeacon of the southern area of the district.
Seaman received the gift of a motorcycle, and went about his rounds at a great rate.
In 1924 he succeeded Temple as missionary bishop.
In 1946 Rev. George Henry Quarterman, rector of St. Andrew's Church, Amarillo, was elected the third missionary bishop.
Under Quarterman the district determined to become a diocese and raised a fund of half a million dollars for endowment.
The district became the Diocese of Northwest Texas in 1958, with Quarterman as its first bishop.
He continued his vigorous ministry until his retirement in 1972.
In 1980 Rev. Sam Byron Hulsey, rector of Holy Trinity, Midland, became the third bishop of Northwest Texas.
He proposed and achieved the establishment of a Cathedral House and Chapel in Lubbock as diocesan headquarters and prayer center.
In 1986 the diocese comprised 54 clergy, 36 parishes and missions, and 8,523 communicants.
In 1995 it had 10,116 members in 37 churches, with 45 clergy, including 5 deacons, 6 nonparochial clergy, and 9 women.
Texas west of the Pecos River was ceded to the Missionary District of New Mexico in 1895 and had only St. Clement's, El Paso, in its boundaries.
St. Clement's was founded in 1870 as a parish of the Diocese of Texas.
Other parishes and missions were founded in the area, with additional churches in El Paso, and St. Clement's was designated the co-cathedral of the Diocese of the Rio Grande, which has its cathedral and headquarters in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Josephine Lucchese
"American Nightingale" debuts in New York
On this day in 1920, soprano Josephine Lucchese of San Antonio made her operatic debut with the San Carlo Grand Opera as Olympia in Offenbach's Tales of Hoffman at the Manhattan Grand Opera House.
She was born in San Antonio in 1893, the daughter of bootmaker Sam Lucchese, and received her musical training entirely in the United States and primarily in San Antonio.
During the 1920s and 1930s Mme. Lucchese toured in the United States and Europe, giving both opera and concert performances and singing opposite such leading tenors as Tito Schipa and Giovanni Martinelli.
Known in Europe as the "American Nightingale," Lucchese was an operatic success at a time when it was considered impossible to achieve an international reputation without having first studied in Italy.
Lucchese returned to Texas at the close of her operatic and concert career and taught voice at the University of Texas from 1956 to 1968.
After her retirement from the faculty, she continued to give private lessons to a few select students.
She died in San Antonio in 1974.

Josephine Lucchese
JOSEPHINE LUCCHESE (1893–1974).
Josephine Lucchese, opera singer, was born in San Antonio on July 24, 1893 (some sources mistakenly say 1901).
She was one of seven children of Sam and Frances (Battaglia) Lucchese.
Sam Lucchese was a bootmaker.
Josephine received her musical training entirely in the United States and primarily in San Antonio, where she graduated from Main Avenue High School.
She took up the study of the mandolin at age six and the piano at age ten; at fifteen she began voice lessons with Virginia Colombati.
Three years later she accompanied Mme. Colombati to New York, where she continued her studies and made her recital debut at Aeolian Hall on November 26, 1919.
She made her operatic debut as Olympia in Offenbach's Tales of Hoffmann, on September 22, 1920.
During the 1920s and 1930s Mme. Lucchese toured in the United States and Europe, giving both opera and concert performances and singing opposite such leading tenors as Tito Schipa and Giovanni Martinelli.
Known in Europe as the "American Nightingale," Lucchese was an operatic success at a time when it was considered impossible to achieve an international reputation without having first studied in Italy.
She was featured at the Teatro Nacional in Havana and appeared with opera companies in Berlin, Hamburg, Prague, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Philadelphia.
She was especially acclaimed for her performances of such coloratura roles as Lucia di Lammermoor and Rosina in The Barber of Seville.
Lucchese returned to Texas at the close of her operatic and concert career and taught voice at the University of Texas from 1956 to 1968.
After her retirement from the faculty, she continued to give private lessons to a few select students.
She was twice married: first to her business manager, Adolfo Caruso, and later to Florentine Donato.
She died in San Antonio on September 10, 1974, and was buried in St. Mary's Catholic Cemetery.
Sam Lucchese
SAM LUCCHESE (1868–1929).
Sam Lucchese, impresario, bootmaker, and real estate broker, was born in Sicily in 1868 and immigrated to the United States in 1883.
Upon his arrival in San Antonio, he and his brothers opened the Lucchese Boot and Shoe Factory.
Lucchese took a very practical approach to the making of boots, stressing quality, quantity, and cost efficiency.
According to his grandson, bootmaker Samuel J. Lucchese, he was always eager to implement the newest machines and techniques for increasing production.
In 1919 the factory had a daily production of thirty-five pairs of custom boots along with various other types of shoes.
As his business prospered, Lucchese began to invest his profits in real estate around the city.
In 1912 he purchased the Teatro Zaragoza, situated in the heart of the Mexican-American community in San Antonio and considered the center of Spanish-language dramatic entertainment.
Having no experience in theater management, Lucchese initially hired the Carlos Villalongín Dramatic Company and Juan B. Padilla to oversee operations.
By 1915 Lucchese had dismissed Padilla and began to manage the resident company himself.
His responsibilities included hiring and firing staff, actors, and traveling companies.
He also frequently traveled to Mexico to secure top talent from that center of Spanish-language entertainment.
He later opened the Teatro Nacional, a theater that would become an integral part of San Antonio's social entertainment throughout the 1920s.
In 1923 Sam Lucchese suffered a stroke that forced him to turn over the daily management of the boot factory to his son, Cosimo, and to restrict his involvement in his theaters' operations.
In 1929 he suffered yet another stroke at his home and died.
He was survived by his wife, Frances (Battaglia), and seven children, including a daughter, Josephine Lucchese, who was a nationally known opera singer.
While the family did not continue to actively support the theaters, the bootmaking continued for two more generations until his grandson sold the Lucchese Boot Company in 1970 to Blue Bell, Incorporated, the parent company of Wrangler.
What is the history of Lucchese boots?
Sam Lucchese's boot company was established in 1883 and has continued to make boots the same way for over 100 years.
Sam Lucchese came here from Italy around 1880 and...
Sam Lucchese came here from Italy around 1880 and he made his way down to San Antonio, Texas.
At that point, Fort Sam Houston was gearing up with soldiers and militiamen.
Sam Lucchese brought his shoe trade with him and he saw an opportunity to build boots for the soldiers at the fort, and that's when he established the boot company in 1883.
At that point, he was such a well-known boot maker in that area that he started becoming more of a custom boot maker.
And he developed something called a "twisted cone last," which is one of our hallmarks to what we do.
It's such an important part of the way the Lucchese boot fits.
It actually twisted as opposed to being flat, making it as perfect as you can get to the anatomy of your foot as possible.
So when you step into a boot it literally feels like you are in a sock.
That's how great it fits.
So he started making boots for the soldiers and everything started going for him.
He started doing boots for presidents and kings and Hollywood stars.
From that point (around the 1920s), he started becoming known for his custom boots; just as far as the decorations on them, the fit, and more importantly at that time - who he made boots for.
So he made boots for John Wayne, Gregory Peck, Gary Cooper, Betty Compson, all the presidents from that point on.
Sam Lucchese had a son named Cosimo Lucchese and Cosimo Lucchese took over the company once his father Sam Lucchese Sr. couldn't work anymore and unfortunately later passed on.
Cosimo had a son name Sam Lucchese Jr., which carried the company to about 1980 when he passed away.
The company was still in San Antonio at this point and we actually moved to El Paso in January 1987.
We have been here ever since and currently we are owned by a company called Arena Brand and our sister companies are Resistol, Stetson and Charlie 1 Horse.

James Franklin Perry
James Perry marries into Austin family
On this day in 1824, James Franklin Perry married Emily Margaret Austin Bryan, the widowed sister of Stephen F. Austin, in Potosi, Missouri.
At Stephen Austin's urging, Perry came to Texas in 1830 and, pleased with what he saw of the country, moved his family to San Felipe de Austin in 1831.
Shortly thereafter the Perrys began developing Peach Point Plantation near Brazoria; Stephen F. Austin considered Peach Point to be his only home in Texas, and was buried in the family plot there, though his remains were moved to the State Cemetery in Austin in 1910.
James Perry's loyalty to Austin was complete.
Perry took care of Austin's papers and tried to collect some notes while Austin was imprisoned in Mexico.
Following his brother-in-law's advice, Perry "steered totally clear of politics" until Austin's return but thereafter became active in the movement for independence.
After the Texas Revolution Perry settled down to plantation life but was soon called into service as the administrator of Austin's estate.
He was one of the first to shift from cotton to sugar as a plantation product.
Mrs. Perry died in 1851, and Perry moved to Biloxi in 1853 for health reasons.
He died of yellow fever on September 13 of that year.

Another chapter in Texas History
JAMES FRANKLIN PERRY (1790–1853).
James Franklin Perry, son of James and Hannah Perry, was born on September 19, 1790, in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.
In 1808 he went down the Ohio River in a keelboat and settled at Potosi, Missouri, where he worked in the store of a kinsman, Samuel Perry, and became a partner in 1818.
On September 23, 1824, he married Emily Austin Bryan sister of Stephen F. Austin, whose influence was strong in bringing him to Texas.
The couple had three children.
After Perry had started on an inspection trip in 1830, Austin wrote that Perry had been granted eleven leagues of land by the Mexican government, provided he move his family to Texas before January 1, 1832.
He arrived in Texas late in April and found Austin engaged in surveying this land on Galveston Bay.
Much pleased with the country, Perry left to fetch his family and to set up a store in San Felipe.
A plantation and sawmill were first projected on Chocolate Bayou, but by the end of 1831 the family had decided that Peach Point Plantation would be their permanent home and converted the land at San Felipe into a ranch.
The store was sold in 1834, when Perry decided to put full time into his plantation.
Perry's Landing, a community named for the family and developed to support the plantation, began three miles away on the Brazos.
His loyalty to Austin was complete.
Left in charge of his business, Perry took care of the papers and tried to collect some notes while Austin was in Mexico and took part in sending Peter W. Grayson and W. H. Jack to intercede for him.
Following Austin's advice, Perry "steered totally clear of politics" until his return but thereafter became active for the revolution as a member of conventions and of the Committee of Safety.
He drew up a plan for a line of forts on Galveston Island, the mouth of the Brazos, and Matagorda Bay.
With the return of peace Perry settled down to plantation life but was soon called into service as the administrator of the Austin's estate.
In 1839 he declined to become secretary of the treasury of the Republic of Texas but remained active in town and railroad building.
He was one of the first to shift from cotton to sugar as a plantation product.
Mrs. Perry died in 1851, and Perry took his daughter Eliza to Biloxi in 1853 for health reasons; his son Henry met them there on his way home from graduation at Trinity College, Connecticut.
Both became victims of yellow fever, Henry on September 10 and James Franklin on September 13.
He was buried in Biloxi.

Emily Austin Perry
EMILY MARGARET AUSTIN PERRY (1795–1851).
Emily Austin Perry, early colonist, was born on June 22, 1795, in Austinville, Virginia, the daughter of Maria (Brown) and Moses Austin and the sister of Stephen F. and James E. Brown Austin.
Her family moved to Mine a Breton (later Potosi), Missouri, when she was almost three years old.
She attended Mrs. Beck's Boarding School in Lexington, Kentucky, from October 1804 until December 1808.
In 1811 her mother took her to Camden, New Jersey, briefly, and then to New Haven, Connecticut, to visit relatives, and then enrolled her in the Hermitage Academy near New York City.
On August 13, 1813, Emily married James Bryan in Potosi, and they lived with her parents at Durham Hall in 1813–14, then moved to Hazel Run in 1815 and lived for a time at Herculaneum, all in Missouri.
After James died on July 16, 1822, Emily took in boarders and taught school at Hazel Run to support her family until her marriage on September 23, 1824, to James Franklin Perry.
She had eleven children, six of whom lived to adulthood.
These included William Joel, Moses Austin, and Guy Morrison Bryan.
One Bryan son and three Perry children all died before their second birthdays, and Mary Elizabeth Bryan died in a cholera epidemic at the age of eleven.
On June 7, 1831, the family, composed of Emily and James Perry, four Bryan children, and Stephen Perry, left Potosi, Missouri, for Texas.
They arrived on August 14, 1831, at San Felipe de Austin, where Emily and the younger children remained for several months.
The family lived for the next year on Chocolate Bayou, then began development of Peach Point Plantation near Brazoria, where Emily made her home for the next nineteen years.
She was devoted to her brother, Stephen F. Austin, and was expected by him to set an example for the other colonists.
During the Runaway Scrape, she and her children fled to the east and were aboard a ship on Galveston Bay, close enough to hear the guns fired at the battle of San Jacinto.
That panic almost caused the loss of the colony, Austin wrote later, adding that Emily, who wanted to visit the United States, should "stay at home and abide the fate of Texas."
Rutherford B. Hayes, who visited at Peach Point in 1848, wrote that Emily, "instead of having the care of one family, is the nurse, physician, and spiritual adviser of a whole settlement of careless slaves.
She feels it is her duty to see to their comfort when sick or hurt."
By May 1851 Emily's health was so poor that she went to the United States to seek treatment.
She returned home on July 1, and on August 15, 1851, she died at Peach Point.
She was buried in the family cemetery on the plantation.
Descendants still meet at Peach Point each June to celebrate her birthday and pay honor to her memory.
Emily Austin
by Dara McCoy
Emily Austin: A Frontier Woman for Modern TimesStephen F. Austin wasn’t the only pioneering spirit in the renowned Austin family.
While Stephen led groups of settlers to tame the wilds of the Texas frontier, his sister Emily Austin blazed her own path through a male-dominated era few women of her time dared.
Her story will be detailed in a new biography in 2009 by Light Cummins, Austin College professor of history.
This groundbreaking story reveals that the intertwining storylines of Texas’ birth and the Austin family run much deeper than Moses and Stephen F. Austin.
Stephen F. Austin was named the “Father of Texas” at his funeral by Texas history icon Sam Houston and was a significant leader during the Texas Revolution and its early years as a republic.
Monuments to Austin include the namesakes of the Texas state capital and two Texas higher educational institutions, as well as a 60-foot statue in Angleton, Texas.
His likeness is on Austin College’s official seal.
Yet, obscured by the enormous shadow cast by one of Texas’ most prominent historical figures and by the legal and societal restraints on women of the 1800s, stands Emily Austin.
Cummins is one of the first historians to sort through Emily Austin’s personal papers, while researching and writing the first biography of her life.
His research unveils a depth of character in Emily Austin, sole heir to her famous brother Stephen F. Austin and his Texas land holdings after his death in 1836.
The biography details the political, business, and social life of this unique frontier woman, who defied 1800s-era societal norms for women and put her own stamp on history.
After Stephen’s death, it was Emily Austin who wielded and magnified the considerable economic and political influence of the Austin family heritage and estate.
Despite Stephen’s likeness on Austin College’s official seal, it was Emily Austin who made the donation to provide a financial foundation on which Austin College was built.
It was Emily Austin, through active involvement in Texas economic and social development, who ensured that the Austin family influence on Texas history did not die with Stephen.
The Life of Emily Austin
Though born in Virginia in 1795, Emily Austin spent most of her adolescent life in Missouri, at that time part of the western U.S. frontier, where her father Moses Austin operated a lead mining business.
Emily received a quality education by frontier standards at a Lexington, Kentucky, boarding school for four years and almost two years at the Hermitage Academy, a prestigious girls’ school near New York City.
It was an education that would serve her well and may have played a part in her concern for education later in life.
Emily Austin bedAfter her schooling, Emily returned to Missouri and married a young merchant, James Bryan, who eventually joined her father in the mining business.
But a series of events starting in 1819 would thrust Emily Austin into a role that defined the independent woman who would eventually settle in Texas.
The Panic of 1819, a depression after the War of 1812, left the Austin family in financial ruin.
In 1821, Moses Austin died after obtaining a grant to bring 300 colonists to Texas.
Finishing what his father started was the beginning of Stephen F. Austin’s story in Texas.
Emily Austin’s story took a different turn.
One year after her father’s death, James Bryan died, leaving Emily a young widow solely responsible for four children and her aged mother.
With the family wealth decimated and Stephen committed to the colonization of Texas, Emily’s frontier became providing for her family, a difficult and socially unseemly prospect for a single woman in the 1800s.
“In that social construct, southern men tended to view women of their class as delicate, submissive helpmates,” writes Cummins.
“Women from Emily Austin’s social class in the South related to the world through the framework provided by the men in their lives.”
By 1822, that social construct had failed Emily and no man with the ability to provide support remained in her family.
“All of the Austins were strong-willed people,” Cummins said.
“She was no less strong-willed than Moses or Stephen F. Austin, and her years of widowhood created a circumstance where she could no longer worry about acceptability.”
Survival became Emily’s focus, and by that necessity, self-reliance was born.
She took in sewing from neighborhood men, opened a small school and charged a modest tuition, and put others in her household to work on various crafts, like bonnets, to sell.
Eventually, Emily remarried, to James Franklin Perry, and at Stephen’s beckoning, they moved to Texas in 1831 and established Peach Point Plantation, the place that Stephen also came to call home.
Cummins is convinced the “period of constant hardship and material depravation as the sole breadwinner for her mother and her children” created the Emily Austin who would later be unafraid to manage actively the Austin estate.
Real Estate, Railroads, and Politics
When Stephen F. Austin died in 1836, he left his entire estate not in James Perry’s name, nor in the names of Emily’s sons, but directly to Emily Austin.
“As the sole surviving heir of Moses and Stephen F. Austin, Emily had become one of the largest individual land holders in Texas and indisputably its richest woman,” Cummins writes.
While Texas law didn’t allow married women to enter into contracts in their own name, separate from their husbands, it did allow them to retain personal ownership of land inherited individually, noted Cummins.
Emily’s management and enhancement of this inheritance and the Austin family political and social prominence elevated her as a woman ahead of her time.
Though legal restrictions on women concerning business and contractual transactions often meant Emily had to act through the signatures of her husband or sons when they were grown, Cummins said the letters and records Emily kept revealed her to be very involved in the management of the Austin estate.
Emily was active in urban planning and in selling land — often doing so personally as a real estate agent of sorts — to raise capital and disposable income.
She was an investor in the first attempt to build a railroad in Texas.
Her son Moses Austin Bryan was the secretary of the first railroad company in Texas, but Emily was the chief stockholder, Cummins explained.
Emily even loaned money to Gail Borden to purchase his first herd of dairy cows.
“We all know what he did,” Cummins added.
Throughout Stephen’s life as a political leader, Emily entertained guests and organized parties for her unmarried brother.
Later, when her son Guy M. Bryan entered politics, Emily retained the role of hostess, seemingly unabashed about sharing her views when the opportunity presented itself, Cummins said.
At one point, Emily hosted eventual U.S. president Rutherford B. Hayes, a close friend of Guy Bryan’s, at Peach Point plantation.
Emily also utilized the Austin family wealth and fame in social development through philanthropy.
She was instrumental in founding the first Episcopal church in Texas — a denomination she had been a part of prior to marrying Perry — and recruiting its first bishop, Leonidas Polk, who became a famous Civil War general and has the military base of Fort Polk, Louisiana, named after him.
She also brought one of the earliest educators to Texas in Thomas J. Pilgrim to teach her own children.
Pilgrim founded the first school in Texas with Emily’s support, according to Cummins.
In 1840, Reverend Daniel Baker traveled to Peach Point Plantation, having just left the founding meeting of the Presbytery of Brazos.
The idea to found a Presbyterian college in Texas had formed out of that meeting, and Baker had been told to visit Emily Austin about funding.
Baker’s visit was successful, as Emily and her husband, James Perry, were devout members of the Presbyterian Church and agreed to support the college.
In 1849, Baker renewed his efforts to found the college and Emily honored her earlier pledge by deeding acreage in Brazoria County and all the Austin family’s claims to pension funds or monies due to Stephen from the State of Texas to the college.
It was this gift that made possible the founding of Austin College, one of the earliest colleges in Texas.
Concern for her family was a driving factor in Emily’s life, evidenced by the years she alone supported her family in poverty and by her activity to preserve and grow her inheritance for the future provision of her children.
“When she died in 1851, she passed on to her living children the entire Stephen F. Austin estate, which was greatly augmented in size,” said Cummins.
In fact, Emily’s Last Will and Testament valued her estate at $450,000 in 1851 U.S. dollars, which would roughly equal $12 million in purchasing power by today’s terms, according to Cummins’ calculations.
Emily Austin's Texas?
To diminish Stephen F. Austin’s role in the birth of Texas would be preposterous, but to downplay or ignore the woman who helped raise this “child” diminishes the full legacy of the Austin family.
Stephen’s place in Texas history is cemented, but Emily’s equally important role is just beginning to be revealed and understood through efforts like Cummins’ biography.
“Emily Austin was very much her own woman, with strong and well-articulated personal feelings centered on a steely personality bolstered by a rock-solid resolve for action that would enable her to survive through almost six decades of frontier hardship,” writes Cummins.
“She was in many ways a very modern woman.
As the daughter of Moses Austin and sole heir of her brother Stephen F. Austin, she had political, economic, and social status in Texas, which made her absolutely unique and unprecedented.”
In the 1800s, the fortitude required for a single woman to care for five dependents with no male assistance and later be a guiding hand in the maturation of Texas was no less impressive than the fortitude Stephen displayed in settling the Texas frontier.
By shedding light on these lesser known chapters, the story of Texas, the Austin family, and women’s history gains new breadth and depth.
PERRY AND HUNTER STORE.
The Perry and Hunter Store was established as a result of Stephen F. Austin's writing his brother-in-law, James F. Perry, that he thought there was a good opening for a store in San Felipe and urging him to come by November 1, 1830.
Before that date goods could be introduced duty-free.
During Perry's stay in New Orleans he bought merchandise for the store, and William W. Hunter, who had evidently been taken into partnership, bought more in Philadelphia while he was there in October.
Hunter had charge of the store and received two-thirds of the profits, but he was forced to dissolve the partnership in the summer of 1832 because of his poor health.
He continued, however, with collections until he left in the summer of 1833, when Moses Austin Bryan took charge of the store.
Alexander Somervell came in the summer of 1833 to take Hunter's place in the partnership at the request of Perry.
In 1834 Perry sold out to Dr. J. B. Miller because he wanted to devote full time to Peach Point Plantation.
The store represented an investment of more than $20,000, from which a good return had been made.
Peach Point Plantation
PEACH POINT PLANTATION.
Peach Point Plantation, settled in December 1832, was the home of James Franklin Perry and his wife, Emily Austin Bryan Perry, and was considered by Emily's brother, Stephen F. Austin, to be his only home in Texas.
It is situated between Jones Creek and the Brazos River, ten miles south of Brazoria on State Highway 36, and was named by Austin for the wild peach trees growing there.
Of all the property in his colony, Peach Point was Austin's first choice as a homesite.
Soon after his sister's family arrived in Texas on August 14, 1831, Austin drew up suggested plans for the Perrys' home.
James began clearing land and built a cabin near Chocolate Bayou, where they lived several months before moving to Peach Point.
In the construction at Peach Point Perry followed a number of Austin's suggestions about materials and design of the residence.
In accordance with his later instructions, two rooms built at the east end of the house were set aside for his use as a bedroom and office.
Austin also provided numerous seeds, slips, cuttings, and plants for the grounds.
Both the family and servants at the plantation were hard hit by cholera and other illnesses between June and October of 1833.
During part of that time, no physicians or neighbors were available to check on them, and at the plantation itself almost no family members or servants were well enough to care for the sick.
During the Runaway Scrape in the spring of 1836, after taking the family to San Jacinto Bay, Perry and several of his male slaves went on to Galveston Bay to help build fortifications.
At least in part because of the absence of both family and slaves during this critical period, the entire cotton crop at Peach Point that year was only twenty-two bales.
After Austin's death in West Columbia on December 27, 1836, his body was brought down the Brazos River aboard the steamboat Yellow Stone for burial in the family cemetery at Peach Point.
In 1910 Austin's remains were moved to the State Cemetery in Austin.
In the earliest years cotton was the primary cash crop at Peach Point, and corn and vegetables were grown for use on the plantation.
Hogs, poultry, and cattle were raised there to provide meat, dairy products, and eggs for the family and servants.
Excess quantities of farm products ranging from kegs of eggs to hard soap were sold to Robert Mills and other merchants in the area for credit toward the purchase of items that could not be readily produced on the plantation.
Perry began to experiment with raising sugarcane and processing sugar by 1845.
Under his direction and later that of his son, Stephen, sugar became the plantation's primary crop in the 1850s, when a sugar mill was built.
A brick wall, cistern, and some of the metal piping for that mill remained on the property in the late 1980s.
A communal kitchen prepared food for both family and slaves, but the slaves were also allowed to cook over fireplaces in their cabins.
They had access to a variety of foods, including sugar and molasses made on the plantation, produce from their own kitchen gardens, and eggs from chickens they raised themselves.
They were allowed to farm small plots for gardens, and some had an acre on which they raised cotton that was sold and credited to their accounts with merchants.
They were paid a dollar a day when they were required to work on Sundays in peak periods, such as sugar-making time.
Most work clothes for the slaves were made on the plantation, of heavy-duty fabrics purchased in large quantities.
Rutherford B. Hayes, a classmate of Emily Perry's son, Guy M. Bryan, visited Peach Point in January 1848.
He described the home as being "delightfully situated in the edge of the timber, looking out upon a plain on the south extending five or eight miles to the Gulf" and mentioned the "large beautiful flower garden in front."
During the Civil War and Reconstruction,qqv Peach Point, like other Texas plantations, declined sharply in productivity and profitability, and much of the land was sold to satisfy debts.
Discovery of oil on the property in the 1930s brought better times, and some of the original Peach Point land was bought back by S. S. Perry, Sr., and S. S. Perry, Jr.
With the exception of the two rooms set aside for Stephen F. Austin's use, the plantation house was destroyed by a hurricane in 1909.
By 1948 those two rooms had deteriorated badly.
S. S. Perry, Sr., and his daughter, May Perry Hamill, undertook the painstaking restoration of these rooms, which are now furnished primarily with original Austin and Perry family heirlooms and are shown by the present owners to visitors on special occasions.
A new residence, built at Peach Point by Perry, Sr., in 1949, allows family members once again to live within a few feet of the original homesite.

Hans P. N. Gemmel
Future legal historian born in Denmark
On this day in 1854, Hans P. N. Gammel was born in Denmark.
As a young man he immigrated to America, arriving in Galveston in 1877 and walking the rest of the way to Austin.
There he built a shelf between two chinaberry trees, at Eighth Street and Congress Avenue, where he bought books for five cents and sold them for ten cents, reading and learning from them in the meantime.
Though he had little knowledge of English when he sailed to America, Gammel's ten-cent business became the basis for one of the first bookstores west of the Mississippi to carry a large assortment of miscellaneous literature, law books, and Texana.
Gammel became a publisher of important works by John C. Duval, C. W. Raines, and Noah Smithwick, among others.
His most important accomplishment, however, resulted from the 1881 fire that destroyed the old Capitol in Austin.
From the debris scattered on the Capitol grounds, young Gammel gathered wet papers and charred documents, loaded them in a wagon, and took them to his home.
He and his wife gradually dried the pages on clotheslines and stored them with their belongings.
Years later he sorted and edited the crinkled papers, then published them beginning in 1898 as the famous first ten volumes of Gammel's Laws of Texas, 1822-1897.
This work won immediate acclaim, and with the addition of other volumes in later years the set came to be a basic item in law libraries across the state.

Another chapter in Texas History
KARL HANS PETER MARIUS NEILSEN GAMMEL (1854–1931).
H. P. N. Gammel, early Texas bookseller, collector of Texana, and compiler and publisher of Gammel's Laws of Texas, was born to Neils (Niels) Hansen and Mittie Marie (Brugger) Gammel at Grenå, Denmark, on September 24, 1854.
As a young man he immigrated to America, first to Chicago in 1874, then to "gold fields in the West," before arriving in Galveston, Texas, in 1877 and walking the rest of the way to Austin.
There for a time he and his brother Neils sold trinkets; when Neils left town, Hans built a shelf between two chinaberry trees, at Eighth Street and Congress Avenue, where he bought books for five cents and sold them for ten cents, reading and learning from them in the meantime.
Though he had little knowledge of English when he sailed to America, Gammel's ten-cent business became the basis for one of the first bookstores west of the Mississippi to carry a large assortment of miscellaneous literature, law books, and Texana.
At its peak, its collection was one of the largest of this type in the state.
When Gammel became a publisher, his first title was John C. Duval's Early Times in Texas (1892).
Other notable titles were C. W. Raines's Bibliography of Texas (1896), Noah Smithwick's Evolution of a State (1900), and a reprint in 1906 of Journal of the Continental Convention of the State of Texas (1875).
Gammel's most important accomplishment and the chief basis for his widespread recognition was the result of an early experience.
He was still a newcomer to Texas when, in 1881, the old Capitol in Austin burned.
From the debris scattered on the Capitol grounds, young Gammel gathered wet papers and charred documents, loaded them in a wagon, and took them to his home.
He and his wife gradually dried the pages on clotheslines and stored them with their belongings.
Years later he sorted and edited the crinkled papers, then published them beginning in 1898 as the famous first ten volumes of Gammel's Laws of Texas, 1822–1897.
This work won immediate acclaim, and with the addition of other volumes in later years the set came to be a basic item in law libraries across the state.
Gammel was a Mason, a Knight of Pythias, and a Woodman of the World; he was a Lutheran when he arrived in America, but he and his second wife attended the Presbyterian church.
As a young man in Denmark Gammel was married to Anna Marie Andersen, and one daughter was born to them there.
After Anna's death from typhoid in late 1888, Hans married Swedish-born Josephine Matilda Ledel, who bore him eight children.
His youngest, Dorothea, remained with him at their home until his death, and in his late years she assisted him in cataloging the extensive private library of Texana for which he had been widely recognized.
Gammel died on February 11, 1931, in Austin.
John Crittenden Duval
JOHN CRITTENDEN DUVAL (1816–1897).
John Crittenden (John C., Texas John) Duval, writer, son of Nancy (Hynes) and William Pope Duval, was born at Bardstown, Kentucky, on March 14, 1816, and grew up in Tallahassee after his father was appointed to a federal judgeship in what was then Florida Territory.
Duval returned to Bardstown in 1831 with his mother to continue his education at St. Joseph College.
Late in 1835 he left the college to join a small company organized by his brother Capt. Burr H. Duval to fight with the Texans against Mexico.
The brothers were with James W. Fannin's army when it surrendered to the Mexican forces under José de Urrea.
In the Goliad Massacre on Palm Sunday, 1836, Burr Duval was killed, but John escaped.
Not long afterwards he entered the University of Virginia to study engineering.
He returned to Texas by 1840 and became a land surveyor.
In 1845 he was, alongside William A. A. (Bigfoot) Wallace, a member of John C. (Jack) Hays's company of Texas Rangersqv.
Duval did not favor secession, but he joined the Confederate Army as a private, declining a commission.
He was a captain by the war's end.
He liked to be out in wilderness places, to loiter and to read, write, and recollect.
His writings justify his being called the first Texas man of letters.
Early Times in Texas was published serially in Burke's Weekly at Macon, Georgia, in 1867, although it did not appear in book form (and then only as a pamphlet printed on rotten paper) until 1892.
The story of Duval's remarkable escape from the Goliad Massacre and of his more remarkable adventures before he rejoined human society became a Texas classic.
Of all personal adventures of old-time Texans it is perhaps the best written and the most interesting.
The Young Explorers (189?)
, a narrative with a fictional thread, a book for boys, was published as a sequel to Early Times in Texas.
Duval's most artistic and most important book is The Adventures of Bigfoot Wallace, the Texas Ranger and Hunter (1870).
Always free and at home with himself, Bigfoot opened up to his old friend Duval with gusto, and Duval helped him stretch the blanket.
He died in Fort Worth on January 15, 1897.
Extract from J. C. Duval's Early Times in Texas
From Kathyrn O'Connor's The Presidio La Bahia
John Crittenden Duval was one of the survivors of the Goliad Massacre.
In his book, Early Times in Texas, he left a lurid account of his life which cannot be accepted as wholly reliable.
Duval's following account of a raid on Carlos Ranch and encounter with and arrest of Father José Valdez is highly entertaining if not exactly truthful:
Not long after our arrival at Goliad the sobriquet of Mustangs or Wild Horses was acquired by our company from the following incident; M-, our second lieutenant, was a man of great physical powers, but withal one of the most peaceful and most genial men when not under the influence of liquor.
But occasionally he would get on a "spree," and then he was as wild as a "March hare" and perfectly uncontrollable.
The Mexicans seemed to know him and to fear him, also, and when he was on one of his "benders" they would retreat into their houses as soon as they saw him and shut their doors.
This proceeding, of course, was calculated to irritate M-, and he would forthwith kick the door from its hinges.
On a certain occasion he battered down the doors of half a dozen houses in one street; and from that time the Mexicans called him the Mustang, and finally the name was applied to the company.
But few events occurred to vary the daily routine of our life at Goliad.
The following, however, I will mention: Our company was detailed on one occasion to go to San Patricio, an Irish settlement about fifty miles southwest from Goliad, for the purpose of securing a couple of field pieces left there by the Mexicans.
We accomplished without difficulty, and without any opposition, although our scouts had informed Colonel Fannin that a considerable force of Mexican guerillas was in the vicinity of the place.
On another occasion our company was detailed to march to Carlos Ranch, a Mexican village about twenty miles below Goliad, with instructions to arrest certain of the inhabitants, who, it was ascertained, were constantly transmitting intelligence of our movements to Santa Anna, and among the number was the old padre or priest of the village.
In order that the Mexicans might not suspect our object and frustrate our plans by giving the padre and his friends timely warning of our intentions, we left the town quietly after dark in the opposite direction to the one we designed taking.
When safe beyond observation, we turned our course down the river, and making a forced march, we reached the village a little before daylight and surrounded it without alarming any of the inhabitants.
A detachment then entered the padre's house, and caught the bird in his nest, together with five or six other suspicious characters (supposed to be his couriers, as in fact they were), and the whole of them were "bagged" without alarming any of the people in the village.
Having thus accomplished our object, we marched to a point on the river about a quarter of a mile above, where we halted in a grove to rest and prepare something for breakfast.
Placing a guard over the padre and his couriers, we stacked our guns and soon everyone was busily engaged in cooking such "grub" as we had in our knapsacks.
By this time the sun had risen, and we were just seating ourselves on the grass around the scanty fare we had prepared for our breakfast (consisting of hardtack, jerked beef and the inevitable coffee), when our attention was drawn to shrieks and doleful cries in the direction of the village, and seeing a crowd of people coming from it towards us, we hastily sprang to our guns, thinking the Mexicans were about to make at attempt to rescue the prisoners, but as the crowd drew nearer, we saw that it was composed mostly of women and children.
It seems that they had just found out we had captured their reverend padre, and they were coming to bid him farewell and obtain his parting blessing.
I had heard that the Mexicans were completely under the control of their priests, but I had but a faint conception of the fact until I witnessed the scene that ensued.
As they came up the women knelt at his feet, weeping, and mourning, and kissed his hand and even the hem of his priestly robes.
Presently another crowd of women came from the village, bringing with them plates filled with hot "tortillas," pots of coffee, "dulces," etc., intended for the padre's breakfast, and that of the other prisoners, and when they deposited them on the grass before them we took possession of them as the "legitimate spoils of war" and found they were much better than our course of hardtack and dried beef.
Such conduct on our part, I admit, bordered closely on the "sacrilegious," but then you must remember we had been marching all night and of course were very hungry-and, as the Mexicans said themselves, "what better could you expect from Gringos and heretics!"
Seeing that the reverend padre would have but little chance to get his breakfast until we had ours, the women continued to bring in fresh supplies of eatables as fast as we disposed of them.
Finally, however, when our hunger was appeased, the reverend padre and his couriers had a show at what was left.
In the vicinity of the place where we had halted, we noticed a large "corral" in which several hundred head of mustangs were penned.
We were all tired of "trudging" on foot, and concluded we would "press" into the service (a military term for appropriating property belonging to others) a sufficient n umber of these mustangs to mount the whole company.
Accordingly we compelled the Mexicans to rope and equip with saddles and bridles about fifty of them.
We were all I suppose pretty good horsemen, as the term is understood in the "old States," but we knew that these mustangs were only partially broken to the saddle, and we anticipated having some "fun" when we mounted them-though nothing like as much as we really got, for at the time we were totally ignorant of that peculiar trick of mustangs called "pitching," by which they manage almost invariably to get rid of a "green" rider.
When the mustangs with considerable difficulty, after roping them closely to trees, had all been saddled and bridled, at the word of command, we mounted (except five or six who failed to do so) and the next instant a scene of horses kicking, rearing and plunging ensued, of which only a confused recollection remained upon my mind, and in less time than it takes me to tell of it, we were all put "hors de combat" (no pun intended).
sdct
As for the part I took individually in this equestrian performance, I have only to say that I had hardly seated myself in the saddle, when my unruly steed humped his back like a mad cat, reared up, and then came down on his stiffened forelegs with such force that if "next week" had been lying on the ground ten or fifteen feet ahead of me, I would certainly have knocked out the middle.
I was partially stunned by the fall, but soon rose to my feet, and was much relieved and consoled on looking around, to find that all the rest had been served in the same way, except one rider who managed to stick upon his horse in spite of all the animal's efforts to get rid of him.
The Mexicans no doubt had purposely selected the wildest horses in the corral, and it is probable the most of them had never been backed half a dozen times even by the rancheros themselves, who are unsurpassed by any people in horsemanship.
I am confident that the padre and his flock enjoyed this equestrian performance much more than the actors, but as heretofore the laugh had been all on our side, we did not blame them for the pleasure they took in our discomfiture.
However, we concluded to dispense with our unmanageable steeds, "impressed" them by restoring them to their lawful owners, and resumed our march on foot for Goliad.
The Mexican padre was sent to San Felipe on the Brazos, where he was securely caged until Santa Anna and his army were defeated and driven from Texas.
He had the reputation of being a great scoundrel and an inveterate gambler, and his sinister countenance did not belie "the soft impeachment."
I will do him the justice however, to say that we were indebted to him for the best breakfast we had eaten since landing in Texas.
Peace to his ashes.

West Texas's first professional woman artist dies
On this day in 1874, Louise Heuser Wueste, the first professional woman artist in western Texas, died in Eagle Pass.
Wueste, born in Germany in 1805, studied portraiture at the Düsseldorf Academy before marrying in 1824 and had three children before her husband's death.
Thereafter, she resumed her art career as a teacher of portraiture.
In 1859 she followed her son and two daughters to Texas and opened a studio in San Antonio in 1860.
During the Civil War she moved to Piedras Negras, Mexico, to live with her son.
She received few commissions for work during her first years in North America.
After 1865, however, she found many opportunities for painting and teaching.
Louise Wueste periodically left San Antonio after the mid-1860s to live elsewhere in Texas with her children, including her son, Daniel, an Eagle Pass merchant.
Her later work reflected an interest in the people and landscapes along the Rio Grande.
Her work, possibly numbering in the hundreds, has never been cataloged.
Most of it is held by descendants and private collectors.
The largest public collection of her output is owned by the Witte Museum in San Antonio.

LOUISE HEUSER Wueste (1805–1874).
Louise Heuser Wueste (Wüste), the first professional woman artist and portrait painter in San Antonio and western Texas during the 1860s and 1870s, was born in Gummersbach, Germany, on June 6, 1805, the daughter of Heinrich Daniel Theodor and Louise (Jügel) Heuser.
Her father had a successful business in manufacturing and importing paints, and her sisters married Karl Friedrich Lessing and Adolph Schroedter.
Wueste later studied portraiture with Friedrich Boser and Karl Ferdinand Sohn, both eminent artists of the Düsseldorf Academy, a recognized center for realistic, historical narrative painting.
Louise married Peter Wilhelm Leopold Wueste, a physician, in 1824 and had three children before his death at the age of thirty-seven.
Thereafter, she resumed her art career as a teacher of portraiture.
In 1859 she followed her son and two daughters to Texas and opened her studio in San Antonio in 1860.
During the Civil War she moved to Piedras Negras, Mexico, to live with her son.
She received few commissions for work her first years in North America.
After 1865, however, she found many opportunities—painting and teaching art classes in one of her studios.
She also taught in the local German-English school.
Most of her paintings are formal portraits, including those of her family and friends, although she also rendered landscapes in pencil.
Particularly interesting were her sympathetic pencil and oil portraits of children, including her own grandchildren, pictured in mid-nineteenth century costume, in the Biedermeier manner.
Louise Wueste periodically left San Antonio after the mid-1860s to live elsewhere in Texas with her children, including her son, Daniel, an Eagle Pass merchant.
Her later work reflected an interest in the people and landscapes along the Rio Grande.
Wueste died on September 25, 1874, in Eagle Pass and was buried in a local military cemetery.
Her paintings were sometimes signed with her monogram, "LW," and none was dated.
Her work, possibly numbering in the hundreds, has never been cataloged.
Most of it is held by descendants and private collectors.
The largest public collection of her output is owned by the Witte Museum.
WITTE MUSEUM.
The Witte Museum opened in 1926 under the charter of the San Antonio Museum Association, a nonprofit corporation established in 1925.
Ellen Schulz, a local school teacher, had raised $5,000 to purchase an extensive private collection of natural history specimens for the city of San Antonio.
The collection was first housed in the local high school, and when it outgrew this space, Miss Schulz and her supporters petitioned city commissioners to build a new museum.
The building was constructed with public funds and a $65,000 bequest to the city from local businessman Alfred G. Witte, who stipulated that a museum be built in Brackenridge Park in memory of his parents.
The facility was known as the Witte Memorial Museum until 1984, when the name was simplified to the Witte Museum.
The museum survived financial struggles during the Great Depression and World War II through activities that included operation of a reptile garden, a popular natural history attraction adjacent to the museum.
In the 1930s the Witte conducted a series of archeological excavations in the lower Pecos region of Texas, forming the basis for one of its most important collections.
The museum also served as a teaching institution, offering art and natural history classes for all ages.
Continued growth of the museum's permanent collection and exhibits necessitated building additions in 1936, 1949, 1958, and 1962.
Three historic houses, the Twohig House, the Ruiz House, and the Navarro House, were relocated to the Witte's grounds in the 1940s, and two reproduction log buildings were constructed.
From 1969 until 1987 the museum association operated the Witte Confluence Museum (later called the San Antonio Museum of Transportation), to exhibit its horse-drawn carriage and antique car collection.
The museum was located in HemisFair Plaza and closed when the oil and gas recession adversely impacted the association's funding.
The Witte Museum's main emphasis shifted to art in 1970 when an art historian was hired as director.
Subsequently, the museum association purchased and renovated an abandoned nineteenth-century brewery to house its third museum, the San Antonio Museum of Art.
When the Museum of Art opened in 1981, the Witte refocused on its original purpose, to exhibit natural history, anthropology, and Texas and regional history.
As the audience, programs, and exhibits of the Witte Museum and San Antonio Museum of Art increased and diversified in the 1980s, more specialized staff was required to meet the programming needs of these two institutions.
In 1992 the San Antonio Museum Association's board of trustees initiated reorganization to establish two independent museums, and this process was completed in May 1994.
Major improvements and expansions of the Witte campus continued during the 1990s, and in 1997 the museum opened the H-E-B Science Treehouse, designed to provide hands-on science activities for children and adults.
By 2003 a major upgrade of the Witte gallery's climate control system was completed.
The Witte Museum is the legal successor to the San Antonio Museum Association.
The Witte Museum's collections, programs, and exhibits focus on the areas of history, science, and the humanities.
The permanent collection represents ethnography, decorative arts and textiles, science, natural sciences with a particular emphasis on South Texas, and the history of Texas and the Southwest.
Educational programs include workshops, demonstrations and live gallery theater performances for young people and families, in-depth Humanities Center presentations for adult audiences, and Elderhostel programs for older adults.
Ellen D. Schulz Quillinqv was the Witte Museum's director from 1926 until 1960.
She was succeeded by William A. Burns in the 1960s, Jack R. McGregor in the 1970s, Mark Lane (1982–1995), and Linda K. Johnson (1995–1998).
James C. McNutt became director in 1999 and continued in that position as of 2003.
The Witte Museum was accredited by the American Association of Museums in 1974 and reaccredited in 1991.

Andy Adams
Famed cowboy memoirist dies
On this day in 1935, the famed cowboy memoirist Andy Adams died.
Adams, born in Indiana in 1859, was one of the few writers of the West who had a knowledge based on experience that enabled him to record cowboy life authentically.
Adams traveled to Texas in the early 1880s and remained there for ten years, eight of which he spent in traildriving.
In 1892 he drifted to gold-mining camps in Colorado and Nevada and in 1894 moved to Colorado Springs, where he lived until his death, with the exception of one year in Nevada (1908-09) and two years in Kentucky (1920-22).
Adams was forty-three when he began writing, and Texas was his literary domain.
His available published works comprise seven books and one article.
Because he knew the real West, he was able to write with a remarkable verisimilitude--a quality he maintained without compromise, though it led to many rejected manuscripts, since publishers seemed to demand "Wild West" stories.
The Log of a Cowboy (1903),Adams's best work, tells of a five-month drive of over 3,000 cattle from Brownsville to Montana in 1882 and has been called the best chronicle written of the great days in the cattle country.

ANDY ADAMS (1859–1935).
Andy Adams, author, was born on May 3, 1859, in Whitley County, Indiana, to Andrew and Elizabeth (Elliott) Adams, who belonged to a cultured pioneer Scots-Irish family.
He became one of the few writers of the West who had a knowledge based on experience that enabled him to record cowboy life authentically.
From early youth he helped his two brothers with cattle and horses on their father's farm.
After attending a rural elementary school for a few years, he left home and worked for a year at a lumbermill in Arkansas.
Adams traveled to Texas in the early 1880s and remained there for ten years, eight of which he spent in traildriving.
He had become a foreman before he left the trail in 1890.
After that he remained in Texas two more years, during which he was a partner in an unsuccessful mercantile venture in Rockport.
In 1892 he drifted to gold-mining camps in Colorado and Nevada and in 1894 moved to Colorado Springs, where he lived until his death, with the exception of one year in Nevada (1908–09) and two years in Kentucky (1920–22).
Adams was forty-three when he began writing.
After his first book was published in 1903, he ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of El Paso County, Colorado.
He ran two more times but was never elected.
Texas was Adams's literary domain.
He waited a score of years for the belated recognition that finally came when he was an old man, but he never relinquished a vital interest in the state as a literary source.
His available published works comprise seven books and one article.
Also, the copyright for a play, "Corporal Segundo, A Pastoral in Three Parts," was issued in 1898, but no copy has been found.
While he lived in Colorado, Adams wrote dozens of manuscripts-novels, dramas, short stories, and lectures-that were never published.
Because he knew the real West, he was able to write with a remarkable verisimilitude-a quality he maintained without compromise, though it led to many rejected manuscripts, since publishers seemed to demand "Wild West" stories.
In spite of his admitted limitations of style, he was an honest interpreter of western culture.
In later years he took great interest in sponsoring authentic western fiction among younger writers.
The Log of a Cowboy, Adams's best work, was published in 1903.
It tells of a five-month drive of over 3,000 cattle from Brownsville to Montana in 1882 and has been called the best chronicle written of the great days in the cattle country.
Other books followed: A Texas Matchmaker (1904), The Outlet (1905), Cattle Brands (1906), Reed Anthony, Cowman (1907), Wells Brothers (1911), and The Ranch on the Beaver (1927).
Five of the books were sold in England by London publishers.
The books and an article, "Western Interpreters," in the Southwest Review (October 1924), make up the available works published over Andy Adams's name.
Adams, a large man of strong physique, enjoyed good health until his last year.
He was bachelor by choice who lived quietly and simply and was reticent about himself.
He died on September 26, 1935, and was buried in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Andy Adams
May 3, 1859–September 26, 1935
Born in Indiana in 1859, writer Andy Adams lived the cowboy life on the Texas plains.
He later rendered those experiences in fiction to set Americans straight about life in the West.
Adams arrived in South Texas in 1881 and began rounding up livestock to send to Kansas.
Through his work, he became fascinated with cowboys—their speech, culture, and work habits.
In the 1890s, Adams moved on to Colorado to pursue mining opportunities.
While there, he attended a production of the play A Texas Steer and was offended by its wild-and-woolly portrayal of Texas cowboys.
Cowboys were not yahoos in Adams's mind, but practical workingmen who relied more on their wit than their guns.
He began writing stories to make his point.
In 1903, Adams published his first novel, The Log of a Cowboy, which recounts a trail drive from Brownsville to Montana.
Adams's focus was not the wildness of the West, but its peaceful, pastoral nature—and the effect the land had on the men who worked it.
J. Frank Dobie called it "the best book that can ever be written about cowboy life."
More recently, Larry McMurtry drew upon Adams's novel when writing Lonesome Dove.
Adams published six more books on ranching life and helped shape the genre of western fiction.
He died in 1935.
For More about Andy Adams
The Wittliff Collections at Texas State University hold the papers of Andy Adams's biographer, the literary scholar Wilson Hudson.
The collection contains the research material and notes that Hudson used to write his Adams biography, including J. Frank Dobie's research materials on Adams, maps, genealogical material, clippings, microfilm, copies of letters, articles by Adams, photographs (prints and negatives), correspondence with relatives and friends of Adams, and manuscript copies of several of Adams's works.
Andy Adams wrote at a pivotal moment in the history of western fiction.
The frontier theme in American letters dates back at least to James Fenimore Cooper, if not Cabeza de Vaca or Mary Rowlandson.
In his novels, Adams more clearly built on the tradition of the cowboy memoirist initiated by his friend Charlie Siringo.
Adams touched on themes present in works as diverse as Owen Wister's The Virginian and Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian.
The Western Writers of America is an organization founded in 1953 to promote and sustain this rich literary tradition.
Wister's 1902 novel The Virginian exemplifies the romantic view of cowboys and the West that Adams sought to correct.
The University of Virginia has made a digital copy of The Virginian available online.

James Wiley Magoffin
Mexico arrests pioneer merchant as a spy
On this day in 1846, a Mexican justice of the peace in New Mexico arrested James Wiley Magoffin and four others as spies.
Magoffin, born in Kentucky in 1799, had moved to Chihuahua, where he became a prominent Santa Fe trader, by 1836.
In 1844 Magoffin moved to Missouri.
In 1846, during the Mexican War, President James K. Polk instructed him to join Gen. Stephen W. Kearny's expedition to conquer New Mexico.
Magoffin caught up with Kearny in late July and helped negotiate the peaceful surrender of Santa Fe.
He was en route to Chihuahua to prepare the way for the advance of Col. Alexander W. Doniphan at the time of his arrest.
Magoffin spent several months imprisoned in Chihuahua and then Durango.
After his release in June 1847, he returned to Missouri and organized another wagontrain, but on his arrival at El Paso del Norte he found that the high Mexican customs duties destroyed any hope of turning a profit.
At this time he apparently decided simply to stay where he was, and by June 1849 he had settled on the eastern bank of the Rio Grande, just across from El Paso del Norte.
There he quickly became the leading Anglo-American in the area, building a large hacienda that became known as Magoffinsville.
Magoffin died in San Antonio in 1868.

Another chapter in Texas History
JAMES WILEY MAGOFFIN (1799–1868).
James Wiley Magoffin, pioneering El Paso settler and merchant, was born in 1799 in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, the son of Beriah and Jane (McAfee) Magoffin, Sr., and the brother of Beriah Magoffin, Jr., who later became governor of Kentucky.
In 1824 or 1825 he sailed from New Orleans on a ship bound for Tampico, Tamaulipas, but a storm wrecked the vessel in Matagorda Bay.
He and the other passengers were eventually rescued by a coasting schooner and taken to Matamoros.
Magoffin was the American consul in Saltillo, Coahuila, from 1825 to 1831.
He married the widow María Gertrudis Valdez de Veramendi, a San Antonio native, in Saltillo in 1834.
With headquarters in Matamoros he established important commercial relations between Texas and New Orleans, trading Texas products, particularly cotton, for finished goods such as machinery, hardware, furniture, and clothing.
By 1836 he had moved to Chihuahua, where he became a prominent Santa Fe trader and became involved in copper mining.
"Don Santiago," as he was called, developed a reputation as a shrewd businessman and a genial host given to entertaining lavishly.
In late 1841 he led a caravan to St. Louis and returned by way of Santa Fe with forty wagons of merchandise.
South of Santa Fe he encountered the bedraggled prisoners of the fruitless Texan Santa Fe expedition.
He provided them with coffee and tobacco, and gave them food and champagne in Chihuahua.
Mexican officials suspected him of giving guns to the Comanches to keep them from attacking his wagontrains.
In 1844, because of such suspicions or because of the Mexican government's increasing restrictions on international trade, the Magoffins moved to Independence, Missouri.
There, Magoffin maintained two wagontrains on the Santa Fe Trail and established a mule-breeding farm.
After María died in January 1845, Magoffin sent his two sons to Lexington, Kentucky, where they were educated by a private tutor (the elder of the two, Joseph Magoffin, later became mayor of El Paso), and placed two of his daughters in a convent in St. Louis.
In June 1846 he went to Washington, where his friend Senator Thomas Hart Benton introduced him to President James K. Polk.
Seeking to take advantage of Magoffin's experiences in the Santa Fe trade, Polk instructed him to join Gen. Stephen W. Kearny's expedition to conquer New Mexico.
Magoffin caught up with Kearny at Bent's Fort in late July and helped negotiate the peaceful surrender of Santa Fe.
He was sent on to Chihuahua to prepare the way for the advance of Col. Alexander W. Doniphan, but on September 27, 1846, he and four others were arrested as spies by the Mexican justice of the peace in Doña Ana, New Mexico, and sent to El Paso del Norte (present Juárez, Chihuahua).
To add to his misfortunes, the Mexican authorities reported that all of Magoffin's wagons, equipment, and papers had been stolen by Apaches at Brazito, although they were later recovered.
Magoffin spent several months imprisoned in Chihuahua and then Durango; he was apparently treated well by his captors, thanks in part to his insistence on entertaining them lavishly.
After his release in late June 1847, he returned to Washington and asked the federal government for $37,780.96 in compensation for his services and losses during the war, but Secretary of War George W. Crawford awarded him only $30,000.
With this money Magoffin returned to Independence and organized another wagontrain, but on his arrival at El Paso del Norte he found that the high customs duties imposed by the Mexican government destroyed any hope of his turning a profit.
At this time he apparently decided simply to stay where he was, and by June 1849 he had settled on the eastern bank of the Rio Grande, just across from El Paso del Norte.
There he quickly became the leading Anglo-American in the area.
He built a large hacienda that became known as Magoffinsville; sold mules and operated wagontrains, just as he had in Independence; raised what may have been the first alfalfa crop in the El Paso area; cultivated the first acreage in the vicinity of present-day Anthony, on the Texas-New Mexico border; and, especially after his marriage on August 17, 1850, to Dolores Valdez, the sister of his first wife, reestablished his reputation as a gracious and generous host.
John Russell Bartlett was among his guests at Magoffinsville.
In 1852 Magoffin lent money and supplies to William H. Emory, with whom he had served in the Mexican War, while Emory organized the United States-Mexico Boundary Survey.
In 1849 Magoffin led the local merchants in protesting Maj. Jefferson Van Horne's decision to locate a permanent military post at the old San Elizario Presidio.
At least partially as a result of this petition, the troops remained at Coon's Ranchoqv until they were removed to Fort Fillmore, New Mexico, in September 1851.
In January 1854, Fort Bliss was established at Magoffinsville in buildings leased from Magoffin, who was also the post sutler.
In August 1852 Magoffin acquired an interest in the salt deposits on the eastern slope of the San Andreas Mountains in New Mexico.
In January 1854, having heard that citizens of Mesilla, New Mexico, planned to take salt without paying him for it, he convinced the El Paso sheriff to organize a posse and set out after the salineros.
The twenty-eight-man posse, which included William A. (Bigfoot) Wallace, encountered the 125 or so New Mexicans near the Chinos Road, and a battle ensued.
The Texans triumphed, thanks largely to a small howitzer that had perhaps been lent by the commander of Fort Bliss, and returned with the New Mexicans' captured oxen.
Magoffin and his allies were indicted at Mesilla for assault, but they were beyond the jurisdiction of the New Mexico territorial court and never came to trial.
Eventually, however, Magoffin did agree to pay for the oxen, and two years later the charges against him were formally dropped.
He was a staunch and vocal supporter of the Confederacy.
In March 1861 he and Simeon Hart were appointed commissioners to receive the surrender of federal properties at Fort Bliss.
Magoffin also supplied John W. Baylor and Henry H. Sibley on their marches to New Mexico, and in 1862 went with the Confederate forces to San Antonio.
His properties in the El Paso area were seized by the occupying Union forces.
In the fall of 1865 Magoffin went to Washington to seek amnesty from President Andrew Johnson for his activities on behalf of the Confederacy.
He was unsuccessful, but on November 13, 1865, Governor Andrew J. Hamilton commissioned him to go to El Paso and organize a militia company and a county government.
Magoffin arrived at Fort Bliss on May 6, 1866, but Capt. David H. Brotherton refused to allow him to proceed.
He returned to Washington, and this time, with the intercession of army paymaster Benjamin W. Brice, he was granted amnesty and restored to citizenship.
Magoffin returned to San Antonio, where he died on September 27, 1868, following a long siege of dropsy.
The Story of James Wiley Magoffin
Written by Luther Allen Davenport
The story of Beriah Magoffin has been told many times.
This man for which Magoffin County, Kentucky was named, served as Kentucky's 21st Governor.
His term in office occurred during the most turbulent times in our state and nation's history, The American Civil War.
He dedicated his life to public service, and was considered among one of the wealthiest men in Kentucky.
Anything this writer might contribute on his life would serve no other purpose than to validate the volumes already written about this man.
What most Kentuckians fail to realize however, is that Governor Magoffin had an older brother.
A brother that perhaps contributed as much or maybe more to our nation's posterity than his more famous sibling, but whose story as a trail blazer, a war hero, and the founder of a great city has largely been forgotten to time.
James Wiley Magoffin, was the oldest child of Beriah sr. and his wife Jane McAfee Magoffin.
He was born in Harrodsburg, Mercer County, KY. in the year 1799.
The children of a successful Harrodsburg merchant, the Magoffin clan enjoyed a life of privilege, and unlimited opportunity.
James attended the finest primary schools available and later attended Centre College in Danville.
Upon his graduation from Centre, he set into the world to find his own fortunes.
His aspirations for success took him far away from Mercer County, and the year 1824 found him in the city of New Orleans.
In that year, for reasons unknown, perhaps a business venture of some kind, he boarded a ship bound for Tampico, Mexico, but while in route across the Gulf of Mexico, a horrible storm set upon them and caused a shipwreck.
James and the other survivors were plucked from the sea and taken to the port city of Matamores.
He soon recovered from his ordeal, and found unlimited prospects for a young ambitious American in Matamores.
He quickly won the admiration of some influential officials, and from 1825-1831 he served as the American Consul for the province of Coahuila.
All the while establishing connections that would prove beneficial in later enterprises.
In 1834 he married into a well connected family, and had became the head of a successful trade company.
He made a sizable fortune in the cotton trade, and other commodities, and by 1836 he had expanded his ente rprises to include copper mining.
He later moved to the Chihuahua Province of Northern Mexico, and soon became a prominent businessman there.
In 1841 he set upon an adventurous enterprise.
Leaving his home near Santa Fe, he traveled across the great southwest desert leading a caravan to St Louis, Missouri.
He returned later that year with forty wagons loaded with trade goods and supplies.
The Santa Fe Trail as his route would become known, became a vital overland trade route between Northern Mexico and the productive factories and mills of the Eastern United States.
Over the next few years, the Santa Fe Trail made some very rich men, including James Wiley Magoffin.
The great wealth that the Santa Fe Trail provided was not without risk.
The cost of organizing a wagon train was high as were the dangers in crossing the desert.
Not only was the desert itself a danger, but Indians often attacked these caravans, killing many men and destroying goods and stealing horses.
It is doubtful that Magoffin was immune to these perils, but his wagon trains seemed to suffer far less than any of the other merchants, and Mexican officials accused him of trading guns and other supplies to the Indians in exchange for safe passage.
Most likely his larger caravans, with more well armed men made such an attack impractical, the Indians simply waited for easier prey.
Nonetheless these suspicions along with increased trade restrictions due to high tensions between the United States and Mexico, encouraged James to move his family away from Santa Fe and back to the United States, settling in Independence, Missouri.
From here he continued to organize trains over the tr ail, but concentrated more on raising livestock to sell to other merchants.
In 1845, not long after moving to Missouri, Mrs. Magoffin passed away.
He sent his sons to Lexington, Kentucky for continued education, and enrolled his daughters in school at a St Louis convent.
He continued his business activities which required extensive travel, and June of 1846 found him in Washington D.C. where his good friend Missouri Senator, Thomas Hart Benton, introduced him President James K. Polk.
President Polk was intrigued by MagoffinÅ’s life in Mexico, and summoned him for extended conversations.
A lingering border dispute between the United States and Mexico had developed into an all out war.
These meetings between Magoffin and Polk resulted in a Presidential Commission.
He was asked to leave at once for Bent's Fort on the frontier to join General Kearney's expedition into the Chihuahua Province of Northern Mexico.
Despite the past suspicions of trading with the Indians, James Magoffin was still held in high regards among the residents of Santa Fe.
With a handful of men, he moved in advance of the American army into that city, and made contact with local government officials with whom he proceeded to negotiate the peaceful surrender of that place without one shot being fired.
With Santa Fe now in American hands, Magoffin and four men moved on towards the town of Chihuahua to prepare the way for Col. Doniphan's advance, but news of his approach had reached Mexican officials who moved to intercept him.
On the 27th day of Sept.
James Wiley Magoffin and his men were taken into custody, and he was charged as a spy.
He spent the remainder of the war in a Mexican prison, but the loss of his freedom was not his only misfortune, the Mexican Government quickly seized all of his property and business assets within itÅ’s reach.
Following his release from Prison in June 1847.
James returned to Washington and filed a petition for compensation for his services and loss of private property.
The Federal Government awarded him only $30,000, a substantial amount for the day, but well below his total losses.
Nonetheless he accepted the offer, and returned to Missouri.
He invested everything to organize another trade expedition in hopes of recovering his lost fortunes by trading with post war Mexico.
However, upon arrival at the border, he discovered high customs duties imposed by the Mexican Government would make any hopes of realizing a profit impossible.
With his every penny invested and no hope of a good return, he calculated his options.
To go back to Missouri would be disastrous, and he knew his goods would be in high demand south of the border.
He decided his only option was to remain exactly where he was on the American side of the Rio Grande River.
Once again fate smiled on James Wiley Magoffin.
The Mexicans flocked to his new depot as did American settlers who moved rapidly into the southwest territory.
Capitalizing on his good fortune, he laid claim to a vast amount of land surrounding his outpost.
He established a large hacienda nearby, and soon a town grew up around it, which later became known as Magoffinsville.
He continued his trade business, but also expanded his operations to mining and farming, he raised livestock, and is credited with cultivating the first crop of Alfalfa in the area.
After gold was discovered in California in 1849, The Old Santa Fe Trail became a travel route to the west coast and as a result , by the mid 1850's increased Indian activity in the southwest required an expanded military presence.
Once again the American Government called on him for help.
In January 1854 he leased a huge portion of his land holdings to the U.S. Army for a base of operations.
Fort Bliss was established near Magoffinsville, and naturally he was awarded supply contracts to the army.
This relationship however would be short lived as Magoffin was a staunch supporter of the Confederate cause.
Although never an actual soldier, he was one of the commissioners that in March of 1861, requested and received the surrender of Fort Bliss, and all of the Federal property inside for the Confederacy.
He supplied Cols.
Baylor and Sibley on their 1861expeditions into New Mexico, but when the Union forces returned to the area in 1862, he was inclined to accompany the confederates on their retreat to San Antonio, and once again his personal property was seized.
He remained in San Antonio until the war's end, and in 1865 he traveled to Washington seeking amnesty for his actions while an agent of the Confederacy.
His appeal fell on deaf ears, and he was turned away, but upon his return to Texas in November 1865 he was commissioned by Governor Hamilton to return to Magoffinsville, and use his influence to help establish a county government there.
He arrived at Fort Bliss in May 1866 to begin this task, but the Federal commander refused to recognize his authority and sent him away.
Dejected, he made another trip to Washington, and at length, after intercession by high ranking friends, James Magoffin was granted a pardon for his actions and restored to citizenship.
He returned to San Antonio, but with failing health, and after a long bout with illness he passed away at the home of his daughter on 27th Sept. 1868.
He never returned to his home at Magoffinsville, and never realized that the little trading post he established there would in 1873 become incorporated as the city of El Paso, Texas.
The Magoffin Family home in El Paso is now the site of Magoffin State Park.
TEXAN SANTA FE EXPEDITION.
The Texan Santa Fe Expedition, a politico-military-commercial expedition of 1841, was occasioned by President Mirabeau B. Lamar's desire to divert to Texas at least a part of the trade then carried over the Santa Fe Trail and, if possible, to establish Texas jurisdiction over the Santa Fe area, which the Republic of Texas claimed on the basis of an act of December 19, 1836.
Texas needed trade, and the Santa Fe market apparently offered the best opportunities, but no steps had been taken to exercise control over the New Mexican settlements until 1840, when William G. Dryden, a citizen of Santa Fe, visited Austin and, on being approached by Lamar, agreed to act as commissioner for Texas in an effort to influence the people of New Mexico to approve the change in government.
John Rowland and William Workman, two other citizens of Santa Fe, were also appointed commissioners.
On his return to Santa Fe, Dryden took with him, in addition to the instructions for the commissioners, a letter written by Lamar to the people of Santa Fe.
In this letter, dated April 14, 1840, Lamar outlined the benefits which would accrue to the New Mexicans on their joining the Republic of Texas and promised that commissioners would be sent out as soon as possible to answer any questions and to perfect the establishment of union.
Failing to get Congressional approval, Lamar on his own initiative proposed an expedition to Santa Fe to establish a trade route as well as to offer the New Mexicans the opportunity of participating in the Texas government.
A call for volunteers was issued, and merchants were promised transportation and protection for their goods to Santa Fe.
William G. Cooke, Richard F. Brenham, José Antonio Navarro, and George Van Nessqqv were appointed as civil commissioners.
The military force, to protect the merchants, was headed by Hugh McLeod with George Thomas Howard as second in command.
The recruits were organized into five companies of infantry and one of artillery.
George Wilkins Kendall and Thomas Falconerqqv accompanied the expedition as guests; these with the merchants, teamsters, and others brought the total number to 321.
Twenty-one ox-drawn wagons carried the supplies as well as the merchandise of the traders, which was valued at $200,000.
On June 19, 1841, the party, officially designated the Santa Fe Pioneers, set out from Kenney's Fort on Brushy Creek, twenty miles north of Austin, and traveled north, crossing the Brazos River just below Bee Mountain on July 8 and striking the Western Cross Timbers in the area of present Parker County on July 21.
The command pursued a northwestern course through the Cross Timbers and continued in that direction to the present site of Wichita Falls, where the Wichita River was mistaken for Red River.
The pioneers followed the valley of the Wichita from August 5 until August 17, when they were deserted by their Mexican guide.
They finally realized their error and sent a company out to the north to search for Red River.
On August 20 a guide returned to lead the command to the northwest.
Harassed by Indians and suffering because of insufficient provisions and scarcity of water, the expedition slowly made its way to the northwest.
On Quitaque Creek in the area of present northwestern Motley County, McLeod, unable to find a route by which the wagons could ascend the Caprock, divided his command, sending a party of horsemen out to seek the New Mexican settlements while he waited with the wagons and the remaining force at the foot of the Llano Estacado.
The advance party, after suffering many hardships and encountering difficult traveling in crossing Quitaque and Tule canyons, finally met some Mexican traders on September 12 and sent a guide back to lead the waiting force on into the settlements.
The Texans had expected to be welcomed by the citizens of New Mexico and certainly had not anticipated armed resistance, but Governor Manuel Armijo of New Mexico had learned of the expedition and had detachments out awaiting the arrival of the Texans.
Capt. William G. Lewis, one of the first of the advance party to reach the settlements, turned traitor and persuaded his comrades to lay down their arms on September 17.
He was again used by the New Mexicans in securing the surrender of the main force, which had crossed the Llano Estacado and was encamped at Laguna Colorada near present Tucumcari, New Mexico, on October 5.
Thus without the firing of a single shot, the entire expedition passed into Mexican hands.
The Texans, reduced in number and broken in health and spirit, had been conquered by the arid plains rather than by the force of Mexican arms.
The Texas prisoners were marched to Mexico City.
They were subjected to many indignities both en route and after their imprisonment in Mexico.
The affair became the subject of a heated diplomatic controversy between the United States and Mexico before most of the prisoners were finally released in April 1842.
Although generally considered a failure, the expedition stimulated a renewal of interest in Texas within both the United States and Mexico and formed a basis for Texas's claim to western territory.
MAGOFFINSVILLE, TEXAS.
Magoffinsville was established by James Wiley Magoffin in 1849 about a half mile north of the Rio Grande on a site within what is now El Paso, Texas, in El Paso County.
Magoffinsville was known as the American El Paso-in contrast to the Mexican city across the Rio Grande, El Paso del Norte, now Ciudad Juárez, Mexico.
Magoffinsville consisted of a group of adobe buildings around an open square and was watered by an acequiaqv that ran from the river to the square.
Magoffin resided in a large, elegant house, in which he lavishly entertained army officers and government officials.
John R. Bartlett was among Magoffin's guests, and predicted that Magoffinsville would remain the center of Anglo-American settlement in the El Paso area.
A post office operated at Magoffinsville in 1852 and 1853.
In January 1854 an army post was established there, with four companies of the Eighth Infantry under Maj. Edmund B. Alexander quartered in buildings rented from Magoffin.
In March 1854 the post was officially designated Fort Bliss.
Most of the buildings at Magoffinsville, including the fort, were destroyed or severely damaged by a Rio Grande flood in 1868, the year Magoffin died.
In 1870 the El Paso postmaster described the site as "only an old dilapidated ranch."
The site was incorporated into El Paso in 1873.
In 1875 Joseph Magoffin, James's son, built a home a short distance west of the site of Magoffinsville, on property that had belonged to his father.

Rebel wife and diarist dies
On this day in 1917, diarist Elizabeth Scott Neblett died in Anderson, Texas.
“Lizzie,” born in Mississippi in 1833, grew up a southern belle in Grimes County and married William H. Neblett, a planter and aspiring attorney, in 1852.
From 1852 until 1863 she kept a diary that revealed an intimate portrait of southern culture and her own bitterness about a woman’s place in society.
“Fame can never be mine,” she wrote.
“I am a woman!
A woman!”
Her letters to her husband during the Civil War discussed varied topics that ranged from the economics of their plantation to the use of artificial birth control.
They had six children, and often Lizzie’s writings addressed the hardships of childbirth and childrearing.
Her journal and letters were finally published in 2001.

Another chapter in Texas History
ELIZABETH SCOTT NEBLETT (1833–1917).
Elizabeth (Lizzie) Scott Neblett, diarist, was born in Raymond, Mississippi, to James and Sarah (Lane) Scott on January 17, 1833.
In 1839, when she was six years old, the family moved to Houston, Texas.
The following year they moved to Fanthorp Springs, three miles east of the site of present Anderson in Grimes County.
The area was sparsely populated, and the first school Lizzie attended was held in a small log cabin.
On May 25, 1852, she married William H. Neblett, a Texas farmer, planter, and aspiring attorney.
The couple spent their first three years of married life in Anderson and moved to Corsicana in 1855.
There William Neblett practiced law, edited the Navarro Express, and farmed property three miles outside of town.
The family returned to Grimes County in December 1861.
Mrs. Neblett kept a diary from March 1852, two months before her marriage, until May 1863, shortly after her husband left to serve the Confederacy.
She wrote, "I can never gain worldly honors.
Fame can never be mine.
I am a woman!
A woman!
I can hardly teach my heart to be content with my lot."
She found one of her greatest hardships to be childbirth; she had six children and asked her husband to let her use artificial birth control.
She was an avid reader of literature and poetry and saved copies of favorite poems and stories in bulging scrapbooks.
Her diary, combined with her letters, scrapbooks, and a memoir she wrote about her deceased husband, provide a picture of a mid-nineteenth-century Texas woman.
Following her husband's death in 1871, she lived most of her remaining years in Anderson, where she died on September 28, 1917.
Her diary and letters were published in 2001.
WOMEN AND HEALTH.
Women-who make up 52 percent of the Texas population-are the major consumers of health services, the majority of health caregivers, and the traditional caretakers of family health.
Women's health care and particularly the conditions under which women give birth have ramifications far beyond the health and well-being of the individual mother and child; they frequently serve as a gauge for society's conscience and faith in the future.
Texas women have always had a nurturing role in matters of health: as women, wives, or mothers, they were responsible for maintaining a healthy environment, preventing illness, maintaining wellness, and treating the sick and injured.
Among the nomadic populations and in agricultural villages, women cared for children, prepared food and clothing, and maintained the home.
In the late seventeenth century the wives of Spanish soldiers were the first European women to settle in Texas in the presidios that supported the Spanish missions.
Women in Spanish Texas continued to fulfill the chief roles of homemaker and mother amid the rigors of frontier life.
Midwifery was important during this period, when women gave birth at home aided by friends and relatives.
In 1809 Governor Manuel María de Salcedo ordered that all midwives register with the city council, pass an examination, and receive a license.
This was an attempt to decrease infant mortality caused by the ignorance of women posing as midwives.
Isolation from other women frequently removed the women of the Texas frontier from their sources of support, advice, and care when faced with illness.
The major treatment in outbreaks of smallpox and cholera was Indian or Mexican folk medicine with prayer.
Jane Long was probably the first Anglo-American woman to give birth in Texas.
She, her daughter, and a slave named Kian spent the winter of 1820–21 on Bolivar Peninsula while James Long was on a military mission against Spanish forces.
Kian successfully nursed Mrs. Long through both childbirth and illness during that winter.
In 1850 men outnumbered women by 15,704.
The housekeeping that was expected of Texas wives and mothers included care of the sick.
During the turbulent decade of the Texas Revolution and Republic of Texas, women ran the farms, ranches, and plantations during their husbands' absence and organized the evacuation of their families as the Mexican armies approached.
Susanna Dickinson accompanied her husband to the Alamo, where she and Andrea Castañón Villanueva served as nurses.
Women in antebellum Texas, faced with the inconvenience and expense of getting a physician, turned to domestic medicine or alternatives to mainstream medicine.
Women within families, particularly plantation owners' wives, assumed primary responsibility for family and slave health, nursing, dosing, and deciding when to call for professional help.
Many black women, both slaves and free, also provided nursing care and midwifery services, and concocted drugs.
Texas women had access to a wide variety of domestic-medicine manuals.
Popular journals and local newspapers were filled with domestic advice, remedies, and advertisements for cures.
The Southern Lady's Companion ran articles on health and healing of special interest to women.
Stores were filled with patent medicines claiming to cure ailments from cancer to coughs.
From Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound to Leidy's Female Pills, patent-medicine advertising was often directed to women, both as consumers and caretakers of family health.
Bolstered by the therapeutic confusion and reform spirit of the nineteenth century, and mirroring the notion of frailty and invalidism among middle and upper class women, patent medicines claimed cures for a multitude of female disorders.
Patent medicines also provided women an alternative to orthodox treatments they considered harmful and a sense of bodily selfcontrol.
Some nineteenth-century physicians were active in the effort to educate consumers against dangerous or fraudulent remedies.
The Texas Health Journal, founded in Dallas in 1888 and the official organ of the Texas State Sanitary Association, characterized itself as "a monthly magazine devoted to preventative and state medicine and the exposure of medical fraud, secret remedies and quacks."
The strict regulation of patent medicines that developed was accompanied by increased reliance on doctors and therefore a loss of females' ability to manage their own and their families' health.
As the nineteenth century evolved, it became fashionable for male physicians in the Northeast to attend middle and upper class women during childbirth.
Women in Texas also invited male physicians into their birthing rooms to take advantage of the shortened labors and painless childbirth they promised.
Physicians were also called by friends or midwives when complications developed.
Once there, the physician validated his presence through his practices.
Such "meddlesome midwifery" was not without opponents, and Texas physicians themselves debated the pros and cons of anesthetics, forceps, and other obstetrical interventions.
The rural character of the state and scarcity of regular physicians, however, made the midwife a necessity.
Some Texas physicians probably enlisted the aid of midwives to assist them in covering their rural practices, and some midwives received instruction and advice from local physicians.
Midwives were protected in the first medical practice act of Texas passed in 1873.
But later, at the 1881 meeting of the Texas State Medical Association, the assembly opposed the part of the act permitting "ignorant and irresponsible females, without any evidence of qualification, to practice midwifery."
Galveston had a training program for midwives in 1890.
"Midwife" was listed as an occupation in the Galveston City Directory from 1870 through 1919.
The female midwife remained the major birth attendant for Texas women at least through the turn of the twentieth century, when 75 percent of births in Texas were attended by midwives.
Nurse-training schools in Texas developed in the nineteenth century, when trained nurses established a public role for women that was fashioned from the domestic sphere and brought cleanliness, order, and respectability to the hospital.
Catholic congregations of women supplied the first trained nurses in Texas; they staffed numerous hospitals, where nursing was eventually formally taught (see CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE).
The first nursing school in Texas was John Sealy Hospital Training School, which formally opened in March 1890 with two students and was followed by six more nursing schools in the next fourteen years.
Domestic virtues such as duty and self-sacrifice were a recurring theme in training schools as student nurses faced demanding physical labor, long hours, little leisure time, and exposure to serious illnesses.
Nursing education became the bridge by which women extended their traditional domestic role of caring for the sick into the public world of work.
Before 1891 physicians trained in Texas received their education in proprietary medical schools and their training through an apprenticeship system.
Formally trained female physicians were quite new when they were first discussed in Texas publications in the mid-nineteenth century.
Those who attempted to follow Elizabeth Blackwell, who had received her medical degree from Geneva College in 1849, were often frustrated.
They frequently met opposition similar to that expressed by Fanny Fern in the March 26, 1853, issue of the Standard: "FOR MYSELF, I prefer prescriptions written by a masculine hand; shan't submit my pulse to anything that wears a bonnet."
Others, such as Mrs. Sarah J. Hale, thought that women were "better qualified by nature to take charge of the sick and suffering...that mothers should know the best means of preserving the health of their children," and "that female physicians are the proper attendant for their own sex in the hour of sorrow."
Thus the debate over women in medicine evolved: either women had no place in medicine because they were female, belonged in medicine precisely because they were female and had important qualities to impart, or belonged in medicine in spite of the fact they were female.
Early Texas female physicians trained outside Texas include Dr. Sofie D. Herzog, who practiced in Brazoria from the late 1880s until her death in 1925; Dr. Margaret Holland, the first woman to practice medicine in Harris County, whose career lasted from the 1870s to 1921; Dr. Juliet Marchant, who practiced in La Porte from 1893 to 1929; and Dr. Minnie Archer, who practiced in Houston from 1894 to 1912.
Other Texas doctors trained outside the state included Ellen Lawson Dabbs, Grace Danforth, and Frances (Fanny) Leakqv.
In 1897 Marie DeLalondre Dietzel became the first female graduate of the oldest medical school in Texas, the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, which opened in 1891.
Female physicians continued to graduate from that institution, an average of one every other year, until 1920.
Dr. Marie Charlotte Schaefer graduated in 1900 and after postgraduate work at the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins, became the first female member of the faculty in 1901.
She headed a department chair from 1912 until her death in 1927.
The university also offered women a degree in pharmacology.
Political activist Minnie Fisher Cunningham (1901) was one of the first women to earn that degree.
In late nineteenth-century Texas, women began to influence health concerns and social reform through political action and women's organizations .
The suffrage movement of the late nineteenth century strongly advocated equal access to medical education for women.
The movement was also intertwined with the popular health movement, which emphasized hygiene and dress reform.
Texas women's clubs were a force in the debate over prohibition, anti-tobacco legislation, child labor legislation, pure-food-and-drug legislation, improvement of public health, sanitation, licensing standards for nurses, improved health-care facilities, and other health measures.
In 1912 the Texas Medical Journal instituted a "women's department" conducted by the wife of the editor, Mrs. F. E. Daniel, and other physicians' wives, female physicians, and consumers.
Mrs. Daniel's purpose was to devote a "few pages" of each issue to "articles of especial value to my sex."
The department continued through 1914 and provided information on social issues, public health problems, and women's health.
Although far from radical, the articles encouraged women to ask interesting questions of their physicians, such as "why so many joyous healthy girls become invalids after marriage?"
and "why so many children are born blind?"
The women medical students of Texas were as forward-looking in the arena of women's rights as the suffragettes or the women who broke into medical education several decades earlier.
The fifteen female students at UTMB in 1912 lobbied to have the position for the secretary-treasurer of the student association to be a permanent female office.
Their efforts were defeated by a vote of 103 to 26.
However, Violet H. Keiller, Class of 1914, was elected secretary-treasurer by acclamation.
She was the daughter of a member of the original faculty and later joined the staff of the medical school.
In 1914 the graduating class consisted of four females and forty males, and the top two graduates were women.
In 1916 the women medical students at UTMB invited all the women physicians of Texas to a meeting.
The Texas State Journal of Medicine listed the names of forty-nine women eligible to attend.
The April 1916 issue of the Journal was devoted to Texas women of medicine.
Contributors included Mary C. Harper (San Antonio), Ethel Heard and Violet Keiller (Galveston), Minnie Lee Maffett (Dallas), and Martha Wood (Houston).
In 1920, Dr. Ethel Lyon Heard, a member of the faculty at UTMB, was appointed as the physician for women at the University of Texas.
Almost thirty years after the first female graduated from UTMB, women were still encountering obstacles to their role in medicine.
In 1926 the hospital board of John Sealy Hospital in Galveston, after vigorous debate, decided that Misses Edith Bonnett and Frances Van Zandt would be allowed to serve internships, though with certain restrictions.
Some of the hospital staff considered work in the male genitourinary division particularly objectionable to women, and expected that the men in this division and the marine ward would not allow women interns to treat them.
The women agreed to have other work substituted during those two six-week terms.
Since the hospital would need to hire two senior students to fill in for them, the women stated they would not expect the hospital to pay them room and board during those two months.
The late nineteenth and early twentieth century brought a massive attack waged by physicians on the character, cleanliness, integrity, training, abilities, and safety of the midwife.
Texas physicians echoed this attack in their journals, although some admitted that midwives were still necessary.
The early twentieth century was a period of struggle for professional cohesion, high standards, and the exclusion of alternative practitioners among medical professionals in general.
Obstetricians were attempting to expand their influence and raise their status.
To eliminate the economic competition of the midwife and general practitioner and to establish their superior expertise, obstetricians defined pregnancy and childbirth as pathologic and themselves as the only safe, successful and qualified attendants.
The substitution of scientifically trained specialists and the hospital for the lay midwife and the home removed childbirth from the female domestic sphere and placed it in the hands of "experts" in the male-controlled professional sphere.
In Galveston, with an abundance of physicians and hospitals, the percentage of midwife-attended deliveries decreased from 35 percent in 1910 to 2 percent in 1923.
The campaign to eliminate the midwife was less successful in rural Texas, however.
In 1924, the Bureau of Child Hygiene of the State Department of Health estimated that 4,000 midwives were practicing in Texas and, at least in certain eastern and southern counties, midwives were attending over 50 percent of the births.
The bureau concluded that many of these midwives "have no training, not even in the simplest rudiments of surgical cleanliness" and recommended licensing and training to remedy the problem.
The twentieth-century public-health movement was effective in analyzing, publicizing, and helping to remedy many of the deficiencies of health care in America.
In the effort to improve maternal and infant morbidity and mortality the focus was placed on the expertise of the obstetrician.
Midwives were generally recognized only as a stopgap measure by health reformers, and efforts to improve their practice were meager.
Training for midwives was provided by public-health nurses in Texas through money allocated by the 1921 Sheppard-Towner law, the first federal legislation to provide federal dollars to states to improve the health of mothers and children.
Opposition to Sheppard-Towner was vigorous.
Physicians opposed it as socialized medicine or as government intrusion into the business of states and the domestic life of American families.
Consequently, its provisions were allowed to lapse in June 1929 and none of the fourteen bills introduced to reinstate it were approved.
If the passage of Sheppard-Towner was the culmination of the Progressive Era women's-health movement, its defeat reveals the movement's declining effectiveness.
The conservative political climate, continued opposition of organized medicine, recognition that women did not vote as a bloc, and inability to maintain a sustained women's-health movement were factors contributing to the bill's demise.
The first half of the twentieth century found the majority of women in Texas still the keepers of the home, whether that home was on a cotton farm or in an oilfield.
About a third of Texas women had entered the workforce by 1930, including a growing number of married women, but most were confined to occupations seen as "women's work" (clerical jobs, retail sales, teaching, nursing).
The world wars brought women into traditionally male-occupied jobs.
Female nurses from Texas contributed to the war effort in both wars.
During World War II an estimated 51 percent of Texas nurses were serving in the armed forces or private war industries.
An extreme shortage of nurses resulted.
Other female-dominated jobs in allied health sciences developed as further evidence of the specialization and professionalization of women's nurturing qualities.
Physical therapists and occupational therapists have been active in Texas since the 1920s.
But the legacy of midwives in Texas did not end in the mid-twentieth century.
In Texas in 1970, midwives attended slightly more than 3 percent of live births.
In 1983 the Sixty-eighth Legislature enacted the Lay Midwifery Act, which mandated the annual identification of persons practicing lay midwifery, delineated the scope of practice, and provided for voluntary educational preparation for those attending births.
With the addition of certified nurse midwives in Texas, almost 5 percent of Texas births in 1989 were attended by midwives.
This small but important resurgence in midwifery is illustrative of the different perspective of the feminist health movement of the 1960s and 1970s when compared with the earlier woman's health movement.
No longer was motherhood seen as woman's primary destiny or the role that guaranteed her a public voice.
Instead, motherhood is seen as one role among many available to women.
The recent feminist health movement has also encouraged women to be an expert on their own bodies, to gain understanding of their biology without submitting to medical control.
Women have been encouraged to alter the terms under which care is provided and to demand demedicalization of such functions as uncomplicated childbirth.
Women's health issues remain complex and challenging.
By the 1980s the majority of mothers worked outside the home, yet they still had major responsibilities for family health, whether caring for ill children or elders or decreasing fat and cholesterol in the family diet.
Women were expressing skepticism about the male-dominated biomedical model and asking why women, particularly pregnant women, are so underrepresented in clinical-research trials and why research into women's health is underfunded.
Women consumers of health care were attempting to understand and shape that care in a way that recognized the larger context of their lives.
Whether as female AIDS activists, in foundations such as the Houston-based Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, or Right-to-Life or Pro-Choice groups, women were becoming more active in influencing the direction of their health care.

Milton Holland
Texas native and former slave earns Medal of Honor in Union Army
On this day in 1864, Milton Holland, of the Fifth United States Colored Troops, earned the Medal of Honor for action at Chaffin's Farm and New Market Heights, Virginia.
He was born a slave in either Carthage or Austin, Texas, in 1844.
After enlisting in the United States Army in 1863, he rose to the rank of regimental sergeant major and led his regiment after all its white officers were either wounded or killed.
He received the Medal of Honor on April 6, 1865, and was mustered out of the service on September 20 of that year.

Another chapter in Texas History
Milton Holland
MILTON M. HOLLAND (1844–1910).
Milton M. Holland, one of sixteen black soldiers to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor during the Civil War, and the first African-American recipient from Texas, was born probably in Austin, on August 1, 1844.
He was the slave and perhaps son of Bird Holland, who later became Texas secretary of state.
Bird Holland freed Milton and his two brothers, James and William H. Holland, and sent them to school in Ohio during the late 1850s.
Holland attended the Albany Enterprise Academy, a school operated by free African Americans.
Holland, too young to enlist into the United States Army at the start of the Civil War, worked as a shoemaker for the quartermaster department of the army until he was allowed to enlist.
In June 1863 in Athens, Ohio, he joined the Fifth United States Colored Troops, commanded by Gen. Benjamin F. Butler.
He fought in the battle of the Crater in the Petersburg campaign in Virginia during 1864 and at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in January 1865.
He rose to the rank of regimental sergeant major.
All of the white commanding officers either were killed or wounded during the engagements at Chaffin’s Farm and New Market Heights, Virginia, between September 28 and 30, 1864.
Holland assumed command and led the black troops in battle.
He routed the enemy and led them to victory.
For leading the charge, during which he was wounded, he received the Congressional Medal of Honor on April 6, 1865, for his bravery in Virginia.
Holland was promoted to captain, but the War Department refused the commission on grounds of his race.
In January 1865 Holland patrolled the lowlands of North Carolina and captured Confederate guerilla fighters and freed slaves in accordance with the Emancipation Proclamation.
Holland was mustered out of the army at Carolina City, North Carolina, on September 20, 1865.
His father and former owner, Bird Holland, had been killed at the battle of Mansfield (see RED RIVER CAMPAIGN) in April 1864 while serving as a major in the Confederate Army.
After the war Milton Holland lived in Washington, D.C., where he worked in the Auditor Office of the United States government; he later became chief of collections for the Sixth District.
He also established the Alpha Insurance Company, one of the first African-American-owned insurance companies, in Washington, D.C. Holland married Virginia W. Dickey.
He died at the age of sixty-five of a heart attack on May 15, 1910, at his farm near Silver Springs, Maryland, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
Born at Austin, Texas, in 1844, he earned the Medal of Honor while serving with the 5th U.S. Colored Troops at Chapins Farm, Virginia, on September 29, 1864 during the Civil War.
The Medal was actually issued to him on April 6, 1865.
He died on May 15, 1910 and was buried in Section 23 of Arlington National Cemetery.
Milton Holland
Milton M. Holland
Milton M. Holland was born on August 1, 1844, to Jack and Emily Holland.
Jack was Toby’s first recorded son.
Milton is the third generation of African Americans born as slaves to the Holland Family Plantation.
Milton M. Holland enlisted as a private in Company C, 5th U.S. Colored Troops.
The 5th Ohio was raised in Ohio and accredited to that State.
He was the first African American Texan to earn the Medal of Honor.
He was mustered into the Union forces on June 22, 1863, at Delaware, Ohio.
Assigned to the 5th United States Colored Troops commanded by General Benjamin F. Butler, Holland saw considerable action in the swamps of North Carolina "capturing forage and emancipating slaves" under the recent Emancipation Proclamation.
As first sergeant of Company "C", Holland was with the James River fleet in its advance on Richmond when his company was ordered to make the attack.
They struck the first blow at Petersburg by capturing the Confederate flag, the signal station, and the officers at the station.
On September 29, 1864, his regiment was in front of Richmond at Deep Bottom where he, as Sergeant Major, led his unit in the most brilliant and daring fight of its career.
With the officers (white) having been killed, and he himself wounded, they fought a fierce battle at Chaffin’s Farm.
It was here that Holland’s daring and courage earned him the Medal of Honor.
Milton was mustered out of the service on September 20, 1865.
He died of a heart attack on May 15, 1910, on a farm near Silver Springs, Maryland.
He is buried in the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

Profile In Courage: Milton M. Holland, Part I
One of the things that I’m sure nags many Civil War authors is the regret that they feel over not being able to include every detail and account that they unearth during their research for their books.
For me, one of the great heroes of New Market Heights who I wish I could've spent more time on was 1st Sergeant Milton M. Holland of the 5th USCI.
Holland was one of the 14 black Medal of Honor recipients from that historic clash of arms, and his life story is one that I found to be particularly fascinating.
Milton Holland was born in Texas, fathered by Bird Holland, a white slave owner who would later fight for the Confederacy.
Milton's mother was a slave on the plantation owned by Bird's brother.
Milton was one of three brothers that were born from this relationship.
When he and his brothers were young, his father purchased their freedom from his brother, their uncle and slave master, and sent the three boys to a school in Ohio.
Holland was still residing in Ohio when Civil War broke out in 1861.
In what will be the first installment of two posts on Holland’s remarkable life, I will now let the good sergeant give you his story in his own words.
The following comes from a letter that Holland wrote to Lt. Col. Joseph P. Mitchell, who was then compiling information on Civil War Medal of Honor recipients.
It is interesting to note that Holland chose to write the letter in the third person.
Milton M. Holland was born in the state of Texas in 1844.
He was attending school in Athens County, Ohio, in 1861 when the first call was made for volunteer soldiers, and responded to the call of his country.
He enlisted in the Union Army in April, 1861, but was rejected on account of his youth.
But so determined was he to serve his country that he immediately sought employment in the Quartermaster Department and served under Colonel Nelson H. Van Hores of the 3rd, 18th, and 92nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry.
He served in this capacity until he was regularly mustered into the Union Army in June 1863 and assigned to the 5th United States Colored Troops, a regiment raised in Ohio and accredited to that state.
Within his regiment he engaged in the campaigns in Virginia and North Carolina under the command of General B.F. Butler.
In the winter of 1863 he was with his regiment in the raid through the Dismal Swamp into North Carolina, capturing forage and emancipating slaves under the then recent Emancipation Proclamation.
In the early winter and spring of 1864, he was with his regiment in the two raids from Yorktown, Virginia to Bottom’s Bridge just outside Richmond: the first raid being made for the purpose of liberating the Union prisoners confined at Libby Prison; and the second for the purpose of assisting General Kilpatrick who, in his attempt to relieve the Libby Prison men, had been surrounded by the Confederate forces.
He was with the James River fleet in its advance on Richmond and, as the fleet approached City Point, Company C, of which Holland was then the 1st Sergeant, was ordered to make the attack.
The order was promptly obeyed and, without landing the vessel, the men jumped from the guard rail of the boat, wading water waist deep to reach the point of attack.
They captured the Rebel flag, the signal; station and signal officers of the confederacy, thus stricking [sic] the first signal blow at the Rebel stronghold at Petersburg.
This regiment was part of the famous Black Brigade which General Smith at first refused to use in his charge on Petersburg on June 15, 1864.
General Butler, commanding the corps, promptly ordered General Smith to march on Petersburg and storm her breastworks.
General Smith led the black phalanx in the charge, and for the courage, the heroism, the daring and skill displayed by the colored troops in that bloody fight, General Smith remarked that he would lead men like those into any fight and rely upon their pluck.
His regiment was at the ‘Mine Explosion’ [The Battle of the Crater] on July 30, and was prepared to make the charge.
They received instructions at a given signal to discharge their guns onto the enemy’s line, jump the parapet and the ditch, and make a charge to cover the ‘Crater’.
But just before the signal was substituted in their place.
This circumstance, young Holland has ever maintained, lost a key to the Union forces that otherwise would have been gained.
It was at this battle that Holland had planned and decided to cover himself in glory.
He was sorely disappointed but never relinquished the desire and intention to avail him of the first opportunity.
That opportunity would come at a place called New Market Heights…

Guadalupe Mountains National Park established
On this day in 1972, Guadalupe Mountains National Park was established.
The 76,293-acre park in Hudspeth and Culberson counties includes Guadalupe Peak, the highest point in Texas at over 8,700 feet.
Indian rock art sites indicate Native American occupation as far back as 12,000 years, and the Apaches lived in the Guadalupe Mountains as late as the 1880s.
In the 1920s J. C. Hunter purchased the Guadalupe Mountain Ranch and raised Angora goats there.
Efforts to preserve the land as a park date to the 1930s when Hunter’s son offered to donate 300 acres of scenic McKittrick Canyon to the state of Texas.
By the 1960s land donations and sales to the National Park Service paved the way for the establishment of a national park.
Guadalupe Mountains National Park contains eighty miles of trails, and the maple and hardwood trees of McKittrick Canyon offer brilliant fiery hues for hikers in the autumn.

Another chapter in Texas History
El Capitan
GUADALUPE MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK.
Guadalupe Mountains National Park, in Hudspeth and Culberson counties on the New Mexico border, preserves some of the exposed remnants of the Capitan Reef, one of the world's finest examples of ancient barrier reefs.
The Guadalupe Range slopes upward from New Mexico to its highest peak within the national park.
The park comprises 76,293 acres and includes the four highest peaks in Texas.
Beginning some 250 million years ago, seawater and decaying marine organisms deposited lime along the shallow shelf of the Delaware Basin of the Permian Sea, forming a reef many hundreds of feet thick.
Sediments buried the reef as the ocean drained away.
Compression within the earth pushed up the area within the past ten to twelve million years.
Erosion began to wear away the softer sedimentary rock, exposing parts of the hard limestone of the Capitan Reef.
In a process that continues today, runoff from the old reef began to deposit salt on the flats now west of the park boundaries.
Plants and animals combine in the park in a mixture of species native to Mexico, the Rocky Mountains, and the eastern United States.
The park includes a small segment of the Chihuahuan Desert and protects such desert species as prickly pear cacti, walking-stick chollas, kangaroo rats, and coyotes.
The cliffs of McKittrick Canyon harbor an oasis of spring-fed streams, porcupines, mule deer, and lush stands of grey oak, velvet ash, bigtooth maple, and alligator juniper.
Wild turkeys, elk, mountain lions, and black bears roam forests of conifers and aspens at higher elevations.
Many species of birds, ranging from hummingbirds to golden eagles, may be found in the park.
Aoudad sheep that were introduced into the Guadalupes from North Africa by hunting-lease operators have taken over the ecological niche once occupied by desert bighorn sheep, which had been killed off in the Guadalupes by 1910 .
Federal law now protects all animals, plants, fossils, and natural or historical objects in the park.
Hunter-gatherer groups left pictographs and cooking pits in the Guadalupes as early as 12,000 years ago; some Indian rock art sites are now accessible by park trails.
Mescalero Apaches claimed the Guadalupes as one of their last strongholds after Comanche horsemen and subsequently the United States Army pushed them from the plains below.
As early as 1680 the Apaches raided the small community of El Paso del Norte (Ciudad Juárez), 100 miles to the west, and for nearly two centuries harassed Comanches and whites alike from the Guadalupe highlands.
A troop of United States Cavalry, led by Lt. Howard B. Cushing, devastated a Mescalero encampment at Manzanillo Springs on December 30, 1869.
A company of Texas Rangers ambushed the remaining, fugitive Guadalupe Apaches on January 29, 1881, at Hueco Tanks.
The first Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoaches to leave either end of the St. Louis-San Francisco mail route met just west of Guadalupe Pass in 1858.
The Pinery stagecoach station near Pine Springs was once a regular stop, and its stone foundations remain near the park entrance.
Most of the land within the park was once the Guadalupe Mountain Ranch, sold to the federal government by J. C. Hunter, Jr., whose father had purchased the ranch in 1924 and produced mohair from Angora goats there.
The 500-odd elk or wapiti (Cervus canadensis) now inhabiting the park and the prairies below are descendants of forty-seven animals that the Wind Cave Refuge of South Dakota shipped to Hunter in 1928 to replace the native Merriam's elk that had been hunted out of the Guadalupes by the 1880s.
Hunter offered in 1933 to donate 300 acres of land in McKittrick Canyon to the state, to be made into a state park in exchange for a highway to the canyon entrance.
Despite the canyon's scenery and recreational potential, however, the state park board concluded in a 1938 study of the area that developers would likely mar the surrounding private lands unless the state could acquire the adjacent property.
Wallace E. Pratt, a petroleum geologist, donated 4,988 acres of his ranch in North McKittrick Canyon to the National Park Service on October 14, 1959.
Pratt later donated another 684 acres after discussing with J. C. Hunter, Jr., and Hunter's representative, Edward Glenn Biggs, their plans to sell the 71,790 acres of the Guadalupe Mountain Ranch to the federal government and to have the area set aside as a national park.
Biggs organized a lobbying effort at the Department of the Interior in Washington and a publicity campaign in the area to promote the park.
He invited members of local chambers of commerce, writers in local and national publications, senators, governors, and congressmen to spend weekends at the ranch.
The National Park Service conducted an initial survey of the area in 1962 and reported that it appeared to meet the criteria for national parks.
Texas senators and congressmen introduced bills in Congress in 1963 and 1965 to establish Guadalupe Mountains National Park, but opposition surfaced to the purchase of more Texas land while approval was pending for Padre Island National Seashore and Big Thicket National Preserve.
There was also opposition, which continues, from area ranchers who had leased approximately 12,000 acres adjoining the park, now used as a buffer zone to protect the fragile flora and fauna of the Guadalupe ecosystem.
On October 15, 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the act establishing the park.
The legislation stipulated that all mineral, oil, and gas rights be donated to the federal government before funds would be allocated to purchase the ranch.
The Texas legislature rescinded the state's mineral rights to the land, and in 1967 Texaco and Standard Oil did likewise after drilling a further, unsuccessful research hole at the mouth of McKittrick Canyon.
The park was established on September 30, 1972.
An eighty-mile network of trails offers the best means to see the park, either on foot or horseback.
High-country trails, some the remnants of trails that ranchhands once followed to reach their herds, ascend as much as 3,000 feet over steep terrain.
Trails in the canyons and lowlands are shorter and less difficult.
The maple and hardwood trees of McKittrick Canyon turn to brilliant colors in late October and early November, making fall one of the most popular times to visit the park.
High winds usually blow in the spring, and severe storms may produce flash floods in the summer months.
The National Park Service maintains the Frijole Visitor Center at the park entrance on U.S. highways 62 and 180, a visitor center at the entrance to McKittrick Canyon, and a ranger station in Dog Canyon accessible by New Mexico Highway 137.
Guadalupe Mountains National Park
Established: September 30, 1972
Size: 86,416 acres
In West Texas, only about 40 miles southwest of Carlsbad Caverns, lies a gem of a park that few people outside the state have ever heard of, let alone visited.
Guadalupe Mountains National Park contains the southernmost, highest part of the 40-mile-long Guadalupe range.
From the highway, the mountains resemble a nearly monolithic wall through the desert.
But drive into one of the park entrances, take even a short stroll, and surprises crop up: dramatically contoured canyons, shady glades surrounded by desert scrub, a profusion of wildlife and birds.
Some 80 miles of trails can lead the more energetic hiker to Guadalupe Peak, the highest point in Texas (8,749 feet), and to mountaintops with scattered but thick conifer forests typical of the Rockies hundreds of miles to the north.
The range's origins may be surprising too: The Guadalupe Mountains were once a reef growing beneath the waters of an ancient inland sea.
That same vanished sea spawned the honeycomb of the Carlsbad Caverns.
Pottery, baskets, and spear tips found in the mountains suggest that people first visited the Guadalupes about 12,000 years ago, hunting the camels, mammoths, and other animals that flourished in the wetter climate of the waning Ice Age.
When the Spaniards arrived in the Southwest in the mid-16th century, Mescalero Apache periodically camped near the springs at the base of the mountains and climbed to the highlands to hunt and forage.
Both the Apache and Europeans spun legends of fabulous caches of gold in these mountains.
As American prospectors, settlers, and cavalry pushed west, the Apache made the mountainous areas their bases and fought to ward off encroachers.
By the late 1880s, however, virtually all the Indians had been killed or forced onto a reservation.
Donations of ranchlands eventually gave impetus to the park.
In 1998 the park acquired 10,000 acres adjacent to its then western boundary, including some 2,000 acres of white gypsum sand dunes and dunes of brick red quartzose, both deposits left by the ancient sea.
How to Get There
The main visitor center and most visitor activities are located in the Pine Springs-Frijole area, off US 62/180, 55 miles southwest of Carlsbad and 110 miles east of El Paso.
For McKittrick Canyon, turn off US 62/180 about seven miles northeast of the main visitor center, then continue four miles to the parking lot.
For Dog Canyon, either hike 12 miles from Pine Springs Campground or drive north on US 62/180, then west on Cty.
Rd. 408, and south on N. Mex.
137, about 105 miles total from Pine Springs.
Airports: Carlsbad, New Mexico; and El Paso, Texas.
When to Go
Year-round, but spring and fall are best.
In spring, the foliage is fresh and, with enough rain, the blossoms abundant.
In late October to mid-November, changing leaves provide splashes of red, yellow, and burgundy.
How to Visit
On a day trip, head to the visitor center and Pine Springs; take at least a short hike.
On a second day, visit McKittrick Canyon for a stroll through a hidden oasis.
To visit a wilder, more isolated area, where trails take you quickly into the high country, drive about 2.5 hours to reenter the park at Dog Canyon in the north.
Guadalupe Mountains National Park
Establishment
Guadalupe Mountains National Park was established on 30 Sep 1972.
The park celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1997.
It preserves the rugged spirit and remote wilderness of the American West.
Here, in the ancient Guadalupe Mountains that tower so majestically into the Texas sky, a visitor can delight in grand views, diverse landscape, and small pleasures.
Wallace Pratt, a petroleum geologist who was charmed by the beauty and geology of the Guadalupe, purchased land in McKittrick Canyon in the 1930′s.
In 1959, Pratt donated his land to the National Park Service.
Additional land was purchased from J.C. Hunter, and in 1972, Guadalupe Mountains National Park was created by an act of congress.
Wallace E. Pratt – a Geologist in Love with the Country
In 1921, Wallace E. Pratt accompanied two West Texas oil-lease brokers to Pecos, Texas to purchase leases for his employer, Humble Oil and Refining Company.
He was the first geologist hired by Humble.
While awaiting a meeting with landowners, Pratt was offered a chance to visit what Pecos attorney Judge Drane assured him was “the most beautiful spot in Texas.”
Pratt agreed to go, but during the trip through the barren desert scrub of West Texas, Pratt became skeptical about Drane’s enthusiastic description.
Pratt had nearly concluded that Judge Drane’s beautiful spot referred merely to the high desert mountains; then he entered the canyon, and the beauty of the hidden woodland deep within McKittrick Canyon’s walls was revealed.
In 1921, the canyon was even more spectacular than it is today.
It sheltered a free flowing stream running the length of the canyon with a succession of miniature waterfalls formed when travertine deposits created dams along the watercourse.
These dams were destroyed and most of the stream went underground during flooding in 1943 and 1968.
Maple, walnut, oak, and madrone grew alongside desert plants like cactus and agave, all enclosed by steep walls formed when the creek cut through the limestone of the Capitan Reef.
So unique is this spectacular canyon.
While its towering walls protect the riches of diversity, its precious secrets are hidden in riparian oasis.
It is no wonder that it has been described as the “most beautiful spot in Texas.”
But for all its magical power that delights thousands of people each year, its fragility reminds us that our enjoyment cannot compromise its necessity for survival.
It must survive – not for us, but for all that lives within.
According to archeological evidence unearthed in and near the canyon, the earliest inhabitants occupied the area over 12,000 years ago.
Only stone-chipped tools, bone fragments and bits of charcoal remain to reconstruct the ways of their lives.
More recent discoveries, such as mescal pits and pictographs, help weave a more complete story of prehistoric life in the Guadalupes.
Much later in history, around the early 1500s, the Mescalero Apaches inhabited the canyon.
The Guadalupes provided the riches of game, water, and shelter, and remained their unchallenged sanctuary until the arrival of settlers, cattle drovers, and stage lines.
As the land was taken from the Indians, conflicts arose.
Skirmishes turned to bloody battles.
Settlers demanded protection.
The Mescalero were forced from the area as cavalry troops penetrated the Guadalupes, raiding and destroying Apache rancherias, rations and supplies.
By the late 1800s, nearly all of the surviving Mescalero Apaches in the U.S. were on reservations.
Eventually the rugged land was tamed for ranching and farming.
Grazing and hunting activities took their toll as fences went up.
Wildlife disappeared – Meriam elk, Desert bighorn sheep and Blacktail prairie dogs disappeared from the Guadalupes.
Though settlement occurred slowly in the Guadalupes, people were here to stay.
McKittrick Canyon was named for Captain Felix McKittrick, a rancher who moved to the mouth of that canyon in 1869.
On the return trip to Pecos, Judge Drane told Pratt that the McComb’s Ranch containing part of McKittrick Canyon was for sale.
Pratt acquired a quarter interest for a summer vacation getaway.
His partners were interested in a place to entertain clients on deer hunts, but Pratt recognized the uniqueness of the canyon.
When the stock market crashed in 1929, Pratt bought out his partners and by 1930 he owned a major portion of the canyon.
During the winter of 1931-32 he began construction of the home Houston Architect Joseph Staub had designed.
With the depression on, good help could be hired inexpensively.
From Staub’s office, Pratt hired Vance Phenix, a young architect displaced by the lack of projects.
Phenix brought along his brother, Dean, a carpenter, and Adolph May, stonemason.
Local ranchers Green, McCombs and Alfred Lehman helped haul rock to the site and position materials.
The cabin is made of only stone and wood.
Heart-of-pine rafters, collar beams, and sheathing to support the stone roof were shipped in from East Texas.
The stone used in building the house was quarried outside the canyon at the base of the Guadalupe Mountains.
Always the geologist, Pratt selected “silty limestone”, thin-bedded and closely jointed by clean vertical fractures.”
Workers scraped off the thin layer of earth to reveal the proper stones, then using crowbars, levered the blocks apart.
The joints made the blocks fit well, and Pratt noted that few required the stonemason’s hammer or chisel.
Once complete, the Pratts furnished the cabin with rough plank reclining chairs, four beds, and assorted hammocks, and a special table to seat twelve.
Outdoors was a picnic table made of stone.
Although the cabin is often called the “Pratt Lodge” Wallace Pratt told an interviewer that he had grown up in Kansas and never quite learned what a “lodge” was used for.
He always referred to the house as the Stone Cabin.
During summers when Houston, Texas is hot and humid, the Pratts and their three children spent time in the Guadalupes, sharing the cabin with friends.
This was the principal use of the cabin for over a decade.
When they retired in 1945, the cabin was their home for a brief time.
Years earlier a flood had trapped them in McKittrick Canyon; the experience convinced them that any permanent residence would have to be outside the canyon, and they selected a site on the mountain front.
During construction of the new house, called Ship On The Desert, the New York architects lived in the Stone Cabin for a year.
In the late 1950s the Pratts planned a move to Tucson, Arizona for health reasons.
By 1960 they had bought property there and began to donate the family holdings in McKittrick Canyon to the National Park Service.
Ultimately the donations totaled over 5,000 acres, and included the Stone Cabin and Ship On The Desert.
Although Pratt recognized the geologic and biologic value of his West Texas property, the canyons natural beauty exerted a stronger influence on him than its science.
Pratt said that his early career had been spent in the open.
“Instead of dealing with men, I had communed with rocks-they never let you down.”
In 1957, Wallace Pratt donated 5,632 acres of his beloved property to the U.S. Government for the beginnings of a national park.
His gift along with a 70,000 acre purchase from J.C. Hunter Jr.’s Guadalupe Mountain Ranch ensured that Guadalupe Mountains National Park was authorized by congress in 1966, and officially opened to the public in 1972.
Wallace Pratt died on Christmas Day, 1981; he was 96 years old.
Until his death in 1981, Wallace Pratt remained interested in the “most beautiful spot in Texas”.
As per his request, his ashes were spread over the canyon he loved.
The Stone Cabin remains as a monument to this pioneer conservationist.
Williams Ranch – Living at the Foot of the Mountains
The fragmented history of the Guadalupe Mountains region tantalizes the imagination.
There are few records left behind for the scholar, and the Williams Ranch story is no exception to this scarcity of information.
Historians believe the ranch house may have been built by John Smith of El Paso in 1908 for Henry Belcher and his wife Rena.
Another story maintains that Henry Belcher’s brother constructed the house for his new bride, who stayed only 24 hours before heading for home!
Regardless of the builder’s identity, it is fairly certain that Henry, Rena, and their baby daughter Bernice, were the first people to live in the house for any length of time.
The family moved in with a wood stove, bunk beds, and other furniture, and a luxury for the time, wallpaper.
Standing among the rugged foothills 5,000 feet below Guadalupe Peak, the house, with its attractive architecture and steeply gabled roof, looks out of place.
The builder may have been thinking of the popular styles of the eastern states when he had the lumber hauled by mule train from Van Horn, Texas, sixty-five miles to the south.
The Belchers remained for about a decade and maintained a substantial ranching operation, at times supporting up to 3,000 head of longhorn cattle on the mountain slopes and in the Patterson Hills across the valley.
Water for this venture was piped from Bone Spring down the canyon to holding tanks in the lowlands.
At the turn of the century, grass was abundant here and rainfall was probably greater.
Wildlife was far more diverse and plentiful; bear, wolf, lion, bighorn sheep, prairie dog, and elk were common.
Pronghorn, javelina, bison, porcupine, fox, coyote, bobcat, and badger were numerous in and around the mountains.
Even the jaguar and mighty grizzly may have occasionally found refuge within the sheltered canyons of this remote rocky island.
Thousands of ducks, geese, cranes, and hawks migrated over the highlands in the spring and fall.
The hills and canyons rang with the calls of songbirds.
Spectacular spring wildflower displays were a regular occurrence.
By the time Henry Belcher departed, overgrazing combined with increasing aridity and drought had depleted much of the ranch’s grass cover.
The grasses were replaced by mesquite, acacia, and creosote.
Animal populations were already dwindling due to hunting, trapping, poisoning, disease, the change of vegetation from grasses to shrubs, and competition with stock for diminishing forage and cover.
Today many of these trends continue outside of the park.
The bighorn sheep, bison, wolf, and native elk are gone forever; the bear and lion all but eliminated.
Sometime around 1917, James Adolphus Williams (known to friends as “Uncle Dolph”), a lone cowman from Louisiana, acquired the house and ranch property.
With his partner and friend, an Indian named Geronimo (not the legendary Apache leader), he ran several hundred longhorn.
A few years later he switched to sheep and goats, animals better adapted to the changing environment.
Relatives and hired hands helped manage the 500 to 3,000 animals.
A limited amount of land was also farmed.
Williams and his men frequently visited neighbors, collected firewood, picked up produce at Frijole Ranch, and herded stock to water and grass over precarious trails beneath majestic limestone ramparts.
Dolph Williams owned the ranch until 1941 when he moved to Black River Village, New Mexico, fifty miles to the northeast.
He died there in 1942.
The ranch was purchased by Judge J.C. Hunter, adding to his extensive holdings in the Guadalupe Mountains.
Judge Hunter’s son sold the ranch to the National Park Service in 1966.
The panoramic west facing view from the Williams Ranch porch has changed dramatically over the last ninety years.
Although the story of the human endeavor here is only vaguely reconstructed, this singular place contributes far more than a mere physical or textbook record.
Its silent eloquence may stir time-worn feelings and engender a profound appreciation for all that once was.
Above all, it evokes a bittersweet yearning for a time of simplicity and beauty that will never be again.
The Frijole Ranch – Pioneer Legacy of the Guadalupes
Artifacts reveal that the Frijole area has been a popular place of settlement for many centuries.
This is not surprising when one considers that Pine, Juniper, Smith, Manzanita, and Frijole springs are all within a 2 mile radius of the Frijole Ranch History Museum.
Mescal pits, petroglyphs, and artifacts discovered in nearby caves reflect early Native American occupation and dependency on the essential water, vegetation, cover, and game found in the vicinity.
Although not well substantiated, some believe that the four-room dugout constructed by the Walcott family in the early 1860s was perhaps the earliest Anglo dwelling in the region.
It is certain that the first substantial, permanent structure at the site was built by the Rader brothers in 1876.
These two bachelor brothers operated a small cattle ranch out of their sturdy rock home, which consisted only of the present front or south-facing living and dining rooms of the structure.
The house was constructed 40 feet from Frijole Spring.
It had double walls of native stone with a filler of mud between; interior walls were also plastered with mud.
While the brothers were the first permanent settlers on this side of the mountain range, it appears they never filed a deed on the cattle ranch.
Apparently, they had moved on by the late 1800s after which the Herring family, about which little is known, lived there.
In 1906, John Thomas Smith filed on the Frijole site as vacant land, referring to the house and property as the “Spring Hill Ranch” until 1912.
Mr. Smith had moved from Wisconsin to Texas, where he married Nella May Carr in 1889, in Sherman, Texas.
They were married for 63 years and had ten children.
The Smiths made a living by truck farming and had a 15-acre orchard and garden east and north of the house.
Over the years, apples, peaches, apricots, plums, pears, figs, pecans, blackberries, strawberries, currants, and some corn were grown; the springs providing more than adequate water for at least two plots.
Periodically, the Smiths would load up their wagons in the evening, covering the fresh produce with wet paper and linen.
They would then travel for two days to Van Horn (65 miles south) where they would sell the fruits of their labor.
They also raised cattle, horses, pigs, and chickens.
The Smith family greatly expanded the Frijole Ranch House in the 1920s.
A rear kitchen and two bedrooms were added, as well as a second story and dormers .
A gable roof with wood shakes eventually covered the house.
The building in the northeast corner of the lot was first erected as a bunkhouse for hired help, but was later used as a guest house.
Like the original home, that structure and the double toilet (a luxury) were constructed of stone masonry with shed roofs.
A spring-house of wood and stone was also built for water protection and storage.
The areas first hydraulic “Ram Jet Pump” was installed to pump water up the tower located in the front yard to a storage tank for domestic use.
Because of its location and cool interior, the small stone building south of the spring-house was first used to store fruits, vegetables, milk, meat, and other perishables.
Later, with the availability of electricity, a more sophisticated pump system was installed there.
A barn and hay loft was also a necessity.
The red schoolhouse was built with vertical wood siding and a low pitched roof covered with corrugated tin.
Up to eight children from the Smith family and local ranches once attended school there.
The Smiths provided room, board, and a horse, in addition to a $30.00 per month salary for the teacher.
Later, the schoolhouse served as a storage shed and bunkhouse.
Frijole Ranch House has seen many changes in lighting since its construction in 1876.
Originally lit with tallow candles and kerosene lanterns, the Smiths installed a carbide lamp system, which produced acetylene gas that was piped through the house.
This advance was followed by battery-powered lights charged with a wind generator.
Today, of course, the house is lit with electricity, perhaps waiting for yet another technological advance.
As the only major building complex in the region for several decades, Frijole Ranch served as a community center for dances and other social gatherings, as well as the regions official post office, from 1916 to 1942.
Although not built until 1950, the present barn complements the other buildings and is of wood frame construction.
Today park livestock use the barn.
A stone masonry wall encloses most of the Frijole complex.
In 1942, after 36 years, John Smith sold the Frijole Ranch house and associated property to Judge J.C. Hunter for the price of $55,000.
He then moved with his family to Hawley, Texas, near Abilene.
Jesse Coleman (J.C.) Hunter first moved to Van Horn, Texas in 1911, to serve as Superintendent of Schools.
J.C. Hunter also served as Director and Vice President of the Van Horn State Bank, was a Culberson County Judge and Treasurer, was successful in the oil and gas business, and he was a rancher.
J.C. Hunter began buying land in the Guadalupe Mountains in 1923 and by the 1940s he owned 43,000 acres, including John Smiths Frijole Ranch.
His “Guadalupe Mountains Ranch” concentrated on raising Angora goats, sheep, cattle, and horses.
At one time, 22 tons of mohair wool were produced annually by 4000 Angora goats.
The mountain high country was used as summer range for livestock; water pumped from lowland springs by pipeline to metal storage tanks on top was crucial to its survival.
The Frijole Ranch house served as ranch headquarters for J.C. Hunters foreman, Noel Kincaid and his family from 1942 to 1969.
Hunter was an early conservationist and initiated the first attempts to make the region a park in 1925.
The idea failed to gain momentum and was dropped.
Because Hunter continued to hope for a park in the future, he permitted only limited hunting on the ranch and allowed no grazing in McKittrick Canyon.
Under his stewardship, elk, turkey, and rainbow trout were returned, or introduced, to the Guadalupe Mountains ecosystem.
In 1945, J.C. Hunters son, J.C. Hunter, Junior, inherited the ranch.
Although mayor of Abilene and a successful oil man, Mr. Hunter took an active interest in his lands in the Guadalupe Mountains.
By 1965 he had purchased additional lands and the Guadalupe Mountain Ranch totaled 67,312 acres.
In 1966, he fulfilled his fathers dream and sold the ranch to the National Park Service, at the bargain price of $1.5 million, or about $22 per acre.
From 1969 to 1980, the ranch house served as a ranger residence.
During the next three years, rehabilitation and renovation of the Frijole Ranch buildings was completed by the National Park Service.
Park staff used the ranch house as an operations office from 1983 until 1991.
In 1992, the Frijole Ranch House was again renovated and finally opened to the public as a history museum.
Today’s Frijole Ranch Cultural Museum is on the National Register of Historic Sites.
The National Park Service will continue to preserve Frijole Ranch so that future generations may come to appreciate our diverse heritage.
Guadalupe Peoples
Nde (Mescalero Apaches), westward-bound pioneers, explorers, stagecoach drivers, US Army troops, ranchers, and conservationists are all part of the colorful history of the Guadalupe Mountains.
Until the mid-1800′s those remote highlands were the exclusive domain of Nde, who hunted and camped here.
Later came explorers and pioneers, who welcomed the imposing sight of the Guadalupe peaks rising boldly out of the Texas desert, not only as an important landmark, but also for the water and shelter the mountains provided.
Mescalero Apaches in the Guadalupes
Though numerous archaeological sites and fragments of artifacts are scattered throughout the Guadalupe Mountains, it is difficult to link these findings directly to Mescalero Apache occupation in this area prior to the 1500s.
These people were dependent on hunting and gathering for their subsistence and their survival; their mobile and dispersed populations left little behind.
Without radiocarbon dating, distinctive rock art or tools, and metal artifacts, Apache sites are not easily distinguished from earlier archaeological evidence.
There is physical evidence to place the Mescalero Apache people in the Guadalupe Mountains around 1541, though the details of their lives from that time until the 1700s remains sketchy.
Lack of archaeological evidence aside, the Mescalero Apache oral history tradition reveals the Guadalupe Mountains as a central focus in creation stories, curing practices and as homelands.
The Mescalero are as tied to these mountains presently as they were in the past; the resources managed by the National Park Service in Guadalupe Mountains National Park play a central role for the elders as they pass on tradition, belief, practices, and history to the younger generations.
While many historical documents are vague and nonspecific, and refer to occupation in the Guadalupes only with reference to “Apaches”, there are a significant amount of references to the Guadalupe Mountains as Mescalero homelands in the 1700s and 1800s.
The United States Army engaged in many skirmishes; there are documented confrontations between Mescalero Apaches and units of the Tenth Cavalry-the Buffalo Soldiers-within the present day boundaries of the park.
Prior to their arrival in the Guadalupes, Apaches were competing on the plains with Comanches, who held an advantage by virtue of their travel on horseback.
As a result, Apaches were forced to retreat to mountainous areas.
This fact may hold the key to why these seemingly inhospitable areas became their preference.
Early records kept by Spanish noted that Apache settlements were found in the mountains, with the rancherias always occupying the steepest canyons and were surrounded by difficult passes.
The sites were adjacent to steep but reachable heights, a necessary strategic advantage.
Their cultural lifestyle and the resources within the area held the Mescaleros close to the Guadalupe Mountains.
They survived in this land by applying their knowledge of the terrain and their superior ability to utilize the native plants.
As hunters, they were dependent on mule deer, elk, and bighorn sheep.
As gatherers, they harvested agave, sotol, and bear grass, which they used for both food and fibers.
Nearly all parts of the agave could be eaten, including the leaves, flower stalks, blossoms and seeds.
Agave leaves were collected by prying the entire plant from the ground.
Then the leaves and stalks were roasted in large cooking pits and eaten or pounded into cakes and dried in the sun for later consumption.
Agave fibers were used to make bowstrings, brushes, and sandals and rope.
The leaves were soaked and pounded to release the fibers, which were dried and then separated by combing.
Though they had learned to survive in the conditions of the rugged Guadalupe Mountains, their way of life would not survive the coming civilization of this part of the west.
Settlers, stage lines, and cattle drovers brought in a constant siege of the land that once was the unchallenged sanctuary of the Mescalero Apaches.
The Army was intent on removing the Mescalero from the Guadalupes in order to protect travelers and protect the mail route to and from El Paso.
Constant military patrols and raids on Apache rancherias stressed their resources, and all to soon they were forced to give up and give in to treaties that meant the end of their stay.
By the late 1800s nearly all of the surviving Mescalero were on reservations.
This however, was not before several final heroic attempts by various Apache chiefs to keep their people free.
The Buffalo Soldiers
Following the Civil War, African American soldiers who remained in the United States Army were organized into segregated units, including the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry Regiments.
Their service in controlling hostile Indians on the Great Plains over the next twenty years proved to be as invaluable as it was unrecognized.
These all black regiments, commanded by white officers endured unreasonable hardships and never-ending prejudice, yet became remarkable fighting units whose mark in frontier history is one of courage and devotion to duty.
Called all sorts of names, most insulting, by most they encountered, these units became known as the “Buffalo Soldiers”, so named by the Cheyenne Indians because of their dark skin, curly hair and fierce fighting spirit.
These soldiers adopted this title with pride, the Tenth Cavalry incorporating the symbol of the buffalo into the regimental crest.
Buffalo Soldiers in the Guadalupe Mountains
The casual history novice passing quickly through Guadalupe Mountains National Park learns about the role ranching played in these mountains, that the original route of the Butterfield Overland Mail Stage ran through Guadalupe Pass for a brief time, and that this was the last Apache stronghold in Texas.
But skirmishes between Mescalero Apache and Black troopers is less common knowledge.
Yet hikers along the Foothills Trail walk through an area which was once the sight of a large cavalry encampment.
To the untrained eye, there is no obvious evidence of the camp, but the close proximity to lower Pine Springs made it a valuable site to the military.
An old rifle pit was discovered near this site.
Another camp location at Manzanita Spring was briefly referred to as “Camp Safford” for Lt. Safford who died there of acute dysentery.
Despite some pleasant asides, military patrols in and around the Guadalupe Mountains were long and arduous, food was limited in variety, sometimes quantity, and almost always palatability, and water was scarce!
In fact, many of the patrols made by the Buffalo Soldiers were essentially mapping expeditions for viable water sources and to record significant geographic features.
This information would later prove to be useful in the fight against the elusive Warm Springs Apache Chief, Victorio.
Victorio’s last skirmish with Colonel Grierson and the 10th Cavalry occurred in August 1880, only 40 miles south of the Guadalupes in the Sierra Diablo Mountains, at a place called Rattlesnake Springs.
Desperate for water, the Apache Chief made two attacks on the cavalry before being repelled.
Grierson had cleverly cut the Apaches off from this critical resource; outguessing and beating Victorio’s band to the springs in a marathon 65 mile ride through the harshest of country within 21 hours on horseback and wagons.
Victorio was forced to retreat into Mexico, where he and his band were later killed by Mexican troops.
Their demise was in and of itself a sad passage in the history of people indigenous to this country.
Little has been specifically written about the skirmishes between the Apache and the Buffalo Soldiers in the Guadalupe Mountains, but their spirits ride on the wind, patiently awaiting the long overdue recognition that they deserve in the annals of American history.
A Park Tribute
In February each year, Guadalupe Mountains National Park honors the brave men of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments by displaying artwork depicting the Buffalo Soldiers in the auditorium of the Headquarters Visitor Center.
In July, 1997, Texas Parks & Wildlife employees put on a living history demonstration of the Buffalo Soldiers at Frijole Ranch, near the old military camp site.
Check with the Visitor Center for future living history demonstrations.

This book, a narrative of the Negro Cavalry in the West, remains one of the best sources on the subject.
The Butterfield Overland Mail
On the afternoon of September 28,1858, the conductor of the first westbound Butterfield Overland Mail Coach sounded his bugle to announce the coach’s arrival at the Pinery.
The station was named for nearby stands of pine.
With abundant water from Pine Spring and good grazing, it was one of the most favorably situated stations on the original 2,800 mile Butterfield route.
Located at 5,534 foot Guadalupe Pass, the Pinery was also the highest.
After a meal of venison and baked beans and a change of horses, the weary travelers jolted slowly down the pass on their rough riding stage.
Shortly after sunset, near the base of Guadalupe Pass, the westbound coach from St. Louis pulled alongside the eastbound from San Francisco.
The excited passengers and drivers exchanged comments about their history making encounter.
For the brief space of a conversation, the ends of the continent were connected.
But there was mail to deliver; the stages rolled on as contracted, traveling an average of five miles an hour around the clock, and averaging 120 miles a day.
The Butterfield contract called for semi weekly runs, covering 2,800 miles in a maximum of 25 days.
In its two and a half years of operation the Butterfield never broke its contract.
When the conductor, his driver, and their sole passenger made their first call at the Pinery, there was little to see: a stout corral built of pine that had been cut and hauled from the mountains above, and the tents that housed the station keeper and his men.
But two months later the station consisted of a high walled rock enclosure protecting a wagon repair shop, a black smith shop, and the essential replacement teams of fresh horses.
Three mud roofed rooms with limestone walls offered a double fireplace, a warm meal, and a welcome retreat from the dusty trail of the plains below.
Imagine the feeling of isolation experienced by the station masters and their crews, and the sense of excitement and companionship brought by the stages.
Between Fort Chadborne and El Paso, a distance of 458 miles, there was no sign of habitation other than outpost stage stations.
The stage route between Fort Smith, Arkansas, and San Francisco, California, passed through only two real towns: Tucson and El Paso.
One stretch of route had no settlements for 900 miles; another had no water for 75.
Pinery Station was built of local limestone, in a fortress like pattern.
High rock walls formed a rectangular enclosure with a single entrance.
The three mud roofed rooms were attached, lean to fashion, to the inside walls, which afforded safety and protection from Indian raids.
These walls, built of limestone slabs and adobe, were 30 inches thick and 11 feet high.
The station’s water supply came from Pine Spring through an open ditch to a tank inside the station.
A stockade of heavy pine posts protected the main entrance on the south.
In the southeast corner of the enclosure, a thatched shelter covered the wagon repair shop and smithy.
Livestock were kept in the stone walled corral on the north end.
There was more activity about this station than one might suspect.
The station keeper was Henry Ramstein, a surveyor from El Paso.
He supervised six to eight men who worked as cooks, blacksmiths, and herders.
Four times a week the distant sound of the conductor’s horn announced the arrival of the mail coach with up to nine passengers.
Express riders dashed through at all hours, road crews stopped off, and tank wagons filled up at Pine Spring, rolling on to fill water tanks along the dry stretches.
Freighters and mule pack trains added to the passing traffic.
There were fearful moments, as when an army scout brought word that Indians were sighted in a nearby canyon.
All stock was quickly herded inside the station, bars were secured across the entrance gate, and every man stood ready with his Sharp’s rifle.
At times, soldiers were garrisoned at the Pinery to guard against Indian attacks, which led to stories that this ruin was once a government fort.
There was also news of tragic happenings.
On one occasion a rider reported that the three men who had built this station were murdered with axes at a mail station in Arizona by three of their helpers.
Their construction foreman, St. John, was still living, but had suffered an axe blow that severed his arm.
On another occasion an express rider brought news of an Apache attack in Arizona which stopped the mail and left the station keeper and a passing emigrant family massacred.
The Butterfield Mail Coach continued to come through the Pinery for 11 months until August 1859, when this route was abandoned for a new road that passed by way of Forts Stockton and Davis.
The new route better served the chain of forts along the southern military road to El Paso, and was better protected against Indian attacks.
A total of ten stations were abandoned along the Guadalupe route and 16 were added along the “Fort Trail.”
But long after its abandonment, the old Pinery Station continued to be a retreat for emigrants, freighters, soldiers, outlaws, renegades, and drovers.
It is now a fragile remnant of an early endeavor to span the continent with the first reliable transportation and communication system ever attempted.
Pinery Station has the distinction of being the only remaining station ruin standing close to a major thoroughfare, only 200 yards off Highway 62 / 180, which generally follows the original Butterfield route through Guadalupe Pass.
As such, it is accessible to millions who travel a similar route, only at 50 to 60 miles an hour instead of five!
The ruin is fragile; climbing on the walls can destroy this piece of history.
It is preserved by the National Park Service as a window to the past, in the relatively unchanged, rugged setting that stage riders and Mescalero Apaches saw a hundred and more years ago.
With the help of careful visitors to protect it, this historic location will continue to reflect the spirit of courage and adventure which commanded the senses of long-ago travelers, and still stirs in those who ride this route today.
Geology
The rock exposures in Guadalupe Mountains National Park are part of one of the finest examples of an ancient fossil reef.
It is largely because of the area’s geologic importance that it became a National Park in 1972.
Geologists from around the world come to study this magnificent Permian-aged reef, which formed about 250 million years ago.
The fossil reef was first described by geologist Dr. G.G. Shumard in 1855 while accompanying an expedition looking for artesian water.
However, there was little interest in studying the area more intensely until petroleum was discovered in the Permian Basin in the 1920s.
Geologic History
The Permian Period of geologic time occurred from 280 to 225 million years ago.
The earth had already seen life diversify from simple, primitive forms such as algae and fungi to amphibians, fishes, and insects.
The earth’s surface had also been evolving and shifting.
Thin plates of crust were constantly moving over the softer material below, steadily changing the pattern of the earth’s surface.
The supercontinent of Pangaea had not broken apart at this time and New Mexico and Texas occupied the western edge of this landmass nearer the equator.
A vast Permian Ocean surrounded Pangaea.
A narrow inlet, the Hovey Channel, connected the Permian Ocean with the Permian Basin.
This inland sea covered parts of what is today northern Mexico and the southern United States.
The Permian Basin had three shallow arms: the Marfa, Delaware, and Midland basins.
The middle arm (the Delaware Basin) contained the Delaware Sea which was 150 miles long and 75 miles wide and was situated in what is now Western Texas and Southeastern New Mexico.
During the late Permian Period, a reef developed near the border of the Delaware Sea.
This was the Capitan Reef, recognized as one of the premier fossil reefs of the world and best exposed in the Guadalupe Mountains.
Growth of this massive reef ended near the close of the Permian Period.
For several million years, the reef had expanded and thrived along the rim of the Delaware Basin, until events altered the environment critical to its growth.
The outlet to the ocean was restricted and the Delaware Sea began to evaporate faster that it could be replenished.
Minerals began to precipitate out of the vanishing waters and drift to the seafloor forming thin bands of sediments.
Gradually, over thousands of years these thin bands entirely filled the basin and covered the reef.
About 26 million years ago, faulting occurred in this area uplifting this long-buried portion of the Capitan Reef nearly two miles from its original position.
This uplifted block was then exposed to wind and rain causing the softer overlying sediments to be eroded until the resistant reef was uncovered.
Today the reef towers above the desert floor as it once dominated the floor of the Delaware Sea 250 million years ago.
Capitan Reef Exposures
Rock exposures in Guadalupe Mountains National Park are composed of reef, back-reef, fore-reef, and basin sediments.
Reef – The reef, a submerged resistant mound or ridge formed by accumulation of plant and animal skeletons, is composed of the Capitan limestone.
The Capitan is a massive, fine-grained fossiliferous limestone that formed by growth and accumulation of invertebrate skeletons of algae, sponges, and tiny colonial animals called bryozoans.
These skeletons were stabilized by encrusting organisms that grew over and cemented the solid reef rock, unlike modern reefs built by mainly a rigid framework of corals.
The Capitan limestone forms the thousand-foot high cliff of El Capitan, the most striking feature of Guadalupe Mountains National Park.
Geo ReefBack-reef – There was relatively low wave or current activity in the back-reef, an area between the reef and ancient shoreline.
Only fine sediment was carried back into this area and the water was often stagnant, muddy, and had a high salinity.
Sediment deposited in stagnant back-reef or lagoon waters often contained high amounts of magnesium, which combined with limestone to form the rock dolomite.
Despite the high salinity, lifeforms were able to live in the back-reef.
Brachiopods, crinoids and fusulinids are common fossils found in the back-reef sediments.
Fore-reef – Ocean currents and wave action battered the Capitan Reef, causing chunks to break off and slide down the reef front forming the fore-reef.
The fore-reef is a debris slope that extended downward into the basin.
In addition to debris, the fore-reef was also composed of fossils, such as trilobites, brachiopods, sea urchins, algae and bryozoans, lime muds, and calcium carbonate sediment, but the fore-reef did not become as highly cemented as the reef.
Basin – The basin in front of the reef sloped downward to depths of nearly half a mile.
The sediments that washed into the basin during the building of the Capitan Reef later became thin black limestones separated by thicker beds of fine sandstones and occasional siltstones.
The black limestone contains the organic-rich remains of the dead plants and animals that settled to the dark depths of the basin.
Partial decomposition of the organic material in the stagnant depths used up all available oxygen, so most of the organic matter was slowly buried and preserved.
Over millions of years, heat and pressure have changed the organic matter to oil and gas.
Ancient Life in the Delaware Sea
The Delaware Sea was host to a rich diversity of Permian life.
The reef supported an abundance of organisms, including algae and sponges.
Inhabitants of the rocky sea bottom were sea urchins, bivalve clams, and flower-like crinoids on long, slender stems.
Horn corals were present, but relatively rare.
There were also trilobites, a now extinct class of arthropods with segmented, three-lobed shells.
Ammonoids and nautiloids, ancient cephalopods related to squid and octopi, propelled their chambered bodies through the sea in search of prey.
Deeper on the reef, large clam-like brachiopods clustered together, each clinging to the seafloor by a pedicle, a single fleshy muscle.
Tiny bryozoans clustered in colonies that resembled delicate, lacy fans.
Most life forms could not survive in waters as salty as those of the back-reef, but fossils from those exposures tell us that some adapted well.
Those lifeforms were blue-green algae, masses of small cigar-shaped fusulinids, and clam-like osracods.
The end of the Permian brought one of the greatest mass extinctions of all time.
This event greatly affected life of the Delaware Sea.
Horn corals and trilobites became extinct, along with certain groups of brachiopods, crinoids, bryozoans, ammonoids, and nautiloids.
Sponges came near extinction, and many groups of algae died out, including most of the reef builders.
The Western Escarpment has played an important role in revealing the story of the Permian Period in North America.
These exposures present one of the finest cross sections in the world of several transitions from shallow-water deposits to deep-water deposits.
Abrupt changes in rock types are caused by the change in depth from the shallow submerged areas to the deep waters of the Permian Sea.
Some two miles of Permian strata are exposed in and adjacent to the Guadalupe Mountains due to faulting which uplifted this section of the ancient fossil reef.
Faulting in this area began about twenty-six million years ago.
Along a series of branching faults that run close to the base of the Western Escarpment, the western edge of the Guadalupe fault block has been lifted more than two miles from its original position below sea level.
Fault zones that form the eastern border of the Salt Basin and the western edge of the Guadalupe Block are complex.
They were formed by a series of branching faults that bend to the north-northwest from the southern end of the Delaware Mountains to the northern end of the Guadalupe Mountains.
Most of the faults are nearly vertical and uplift ranges from 2,000 feet to a mile or more on individual faults.
The Western Escarpment extends from Bartlett Peak to El Capitan, with Shumard Peak and Guadalupe Peak, the highest peak in Texas at 8749 feet, in between.
The massive rock face is composed of the Capitan limestone, or the reef complex.
The slopes below the cliffs of Bartlett Peak and Shumard Peak consist of the “bank-ramp complex.”
The bank-ramp complex is made up of the Victorio Peak limestone, the Cuttoff Formation, and the Bone Spring limestone, which formed from unbound carbonate sediments deposited as broad banks.
These banks stretched ten to twenty miles creating a gentle ramp dipping only one or two degrees toward the basin.
These shallow carbonate ramps lack the binding organisms that are prominent components of the reef complex.
Below the cliffs of Guadalupe Peak and El Capitan are the Cherry Canyon siltstones and sandstones and the Brushy Canyon sandstones.
These sandstones and siltstones were deposited as sediment filled in sub marine channels in the basin.

October 1 in Texas History….
.
General Land Office opens
On this day in 1837, John P. Borden opened the General Land Office in Houston.
John, with his brother Gail Borden Jr., had surveyed and laid out the town of Houston in 1836.
As first commissioner of the new land office, John Borden faced the monumental job of compiling and preserving the many Spanish and Mexican land titles issued before the republic.
He began with no funds or employees to assist him, yet by the end of 1837 he had successfully acquired documents from all over Texas.
He also registered and surveyed new grants.
In 1839 he moved the General Land Office to Austin and transported almost 5,000 pounds of documents by wagon.
The military bounties, veteran donations, headrights, and homestead preemptions issued by Borden and successive commissioners amounted to more than 75 million acres granted to individuals.

Another chapter in Texas History
GENERAL LAND OFFICE.
The General Land Office was established on December 22, 1836, by the First Congress of the Republic of Texas.
John P. Borden, the first commissioner, opened the office in Houston on October 1, 1837.
He was enjoined by law to "superintend, execute, and perform all acts touching or respecting the public lands of Texas."
The Constitution of the Republic of Texas honored all grants made by Spain and Mexico that were deemed valid by the republic; later, the state followed suit.
The commissioner assembled from the archives of the former governments a record of valid land grants and translated them.
The Spanish archives section of the Land Office is the depository of records of 4,200 Spanish and Mexican land grants.
Valid Spanish and Mexican grants cover 26,280,000 acres within the present boundaries of Texas.
Some of these grants have received special confirmation by the state legislature, but most of them stand on the original titles from the governments of Spain and Mexico.
Borden moved the land archives from Houston to Austin in 1839.
Borden also began to survey and register the new grants that the republic was issuing.
Those from the public domain were made to colonists who had failed to receive their titles from Mexico, to new settlers, and to all soldiers who had rendered service in the Texas army.
Headrights, military bounties, homestead preemptions, and veteran donations, issued by Borden and successive commissioners, brought the total number of acres granted to 75,647,668.
Sales for the purpose of paying the public debt added 2,990,136 acres.
For internal improvements to the Capitol, irrigation,qqv drainage, iron works, and transportation facilities, including grants to railroads, grants totaled 32,153,878 acres.
For education (the University of Texas, Texas A&M, county schools, eleemosynary institutions, and the public school fund) grants totaled 49,530,334 acres.
The individual grants, patents, and surveys by which the public domain has been disposed of are on file in the General Land Office, and a representation of each, surveyed by metes and bounds, appears on the original grantee map of the county in which the land is located.
Although the financial potential of Texas public land was generally limited to surface properties, over the years mineral resources became financially important.
In December 1960 the state resumed mineral development of the Gulf area, after Texas ownership was confirmed by the United States Supreme Court on December 12, 1960.
The mineral revenues were consigned to the Permanent School Fund.
New departments and equipment became necessary to manage the increased volume of business resulting from these modern trends.
Texas is the only public-land state with complete control over its public lands and over the proceeds resulting from the administration and sale of lands.
As of 1992 the General Land Office was the management agency for 20.5 million acres of state lands and mineral-right properties, including submerged lands out to 10.3 miles in the Gulf of Mexico.
Most of the money from agency leases, trades, and sales goes to the Permanent School Fund, which has received $6.1 billion since 1854.
More than $700 million a year is earned from public lands to help finance public school education.
The General Land Office is headed by the land commissioner, who is elected.
In 1893 the Texas House of Representatives impeached commissioner W. L. McGaughey; however, the Texas Senate acquitted him in the trial.
Commissioner James Bascom Giles, first elected in 1938, resigned in 1955 and was later convicted in the Veterans' Land Board Scandal and sentenced to six years imprisonment.
William Sydney Porter, better known as O. Henry, was employed as a draftsman at the land office from 1887 to 1891 and used it as a setting for two of his stories.
The Old Land Office Building, first used in 1857, has been restored to house historic exhibits.
John Pettit Borden
JOHN PETTIT BORDEN (1812–1891).
John P. Borden, participant in the Texas Revolution and the first commissioner of the General Land Office of Texas, was born in Norwich, New York, on December 30, 1812, the son of Gail and Philadelphia (Wheeler) Borden, Sr.
He came to Texas with other family members in December 1829, and he received 1,102 acres on November 20, 1832, in Stephen F. Austin's second colony, located on the Colorado River in the area that later became Wharton County.
Borden enrolled in Capt. George Collinsworth's company on October 7, 1835, and participated in the taking of Goliad two days later (see GOLIAD CAMPAIGN OF 1835).
He helped write a resolution to Austin informing him that the Goliad men reserved the privilege of naming their own company commander.
He then enrolled in Capt. Philip Dimmitt's company and took part in the siege of Bexar in December 1835.
Borden was discharged on January 11, 1836, but reenlisted a few weeks later and served as first lieutenant in Moseley Baker's company at the battle of San Jacinto.
n late 1836 he and his brother Gail Borden, Jr., surveyed and laid out the town of Houston.
He married sometime around 1837, but his wife, Elizabeth, died on May 10, 1838, in Richmond, Texas.
Sam Houston appointed Borden the first land commissioner of Texas, an office he held from August 23, 1837, to December 12, 1840.
Starting out in his office in Houston, Borden faced the enormous task of acquiring and protecting numerous Mexican and Spanish land titles issued before the republic.
The records provided valuable evidence to validate land ownership.
Borden began with no money, supplies, or employees to undertake his job, and at one time he had to store the records at friends' houses.
Yet in 1837 he reported the successful acquisition of land documents from all over Texas, with the exception of records from three eastern and two southern colonies.
In 1839 Borden moved the land archives from Houston to Austin.
He received $1,200 for the transportation by wagon of almost 5,000 pounds of documents.
In October of that year, with a small group of assistants, he worked on making recommendations for land patents by comparing surveyors' notes.
The office, underfunded and understaffed, faced growing pressure from the public to speed the patent process.
Borden tried to increase public and government awareness of the need for more funding, manpower, and authority for the land office that was responsible for administering 216 million acres of Texas lands.
Frustrated, he resigned in December 1840; his efforts, however, helped demonstrate the importance of the land office.
Borden was a member of the Somervell expedition in 1842 but did not go on to Mier.
He subsequently moved to Galveston, studied law, and was an agent for the Galveston City Company .
He entered a law practice at Richmond and married Mary Susan Hatch in 1843.
They had nine children.
In 1844 he was elected county judge of Fort Bend County and in 1846 was elected chief justice of the county.
The family moved to McGloin's Bluff in San Patricio County in 1855.
Borden established the Ingleside Seminary, a boys academy which he operated until 1873.
In the mid-1870s he moved to Borden, Texas, in Colorado County.
He died on November 12, 1891.
Gail Borden Jr.
GAIL BORDEN JR. (1801–1874).
Gail Borden, Jr., inventor, publisher, surveyor, and founder of the Borden Company, son of Gail and Philadelphia (Wheeler) Borden, was born in Norwich, New York, on November 9, 1801.
In 1816 the family moved to New London, Indiana, where Borden obtained his only formal schooling, totaling not more than a year and a half.
He is thought to have been captain of the local militia when barely twenty years old.
In 1822 he was a principal figure in rescuing a freedman from rustlers.
Shortly afterward he moved to Mississippi in search of a milder climate to cure a persistent cough.
In Mississippi Borden surveyed and taught school.
In 1826 he was official surveyor for Amite County as well as deputy federal surveyor.
After arriving at Galveston Island on December 24, 1829, he farmed and raised stock in upper Fort Bend County and spent some time in surveying.
By February 1830 he had succeeded his brother, Thomas H. Borden, as surveyor for Stephen F. Austin's colony.
In 1832 Borden was named one of three members of the San Felipe committee of correspondence.
In the Convention of 1833 he represented Lavaca District.
He also assumed many of the duties of colonial secretary for Austin in the absence of Samuel M. Williams.
As early as January 1835 Borden made plans to found a newspaper, but it was October 10 before the first issue of his Telegraph and Texas Register, published in partnership with his brother Thomas and Joseph Baker, appeared in San Felipe.
In the meantime he had prepared the first topographical map of Texas and had resumed his responsibilities on the committee of correspondence.
Borden published the Telegraph in San Felipe until March 1836, in Harrisburg in April 1836, in Columbia from August 1836 to April 1837, and in Houston in May and June 1837.
In October 1835 he was appointed collector for the Department of Brazos, a post he held until 1837.
In October and November 1836 he helped lay out the site of Houston.
On June 20, 1837, Borden sold his partnership in the Telegraph to Jacob W. Cruger and became the first collector of the port of Galveston under the Republic of Texas.
His first term as collector lasted from June 1837 to December 1838, when Mirabeau B. Lamar removed him for political reasons.
His second term lasted from December 1841 to April 1843; he resigned after a dispute with President Sam Houston over evaluation of exchequers.
From 1839 to 1851 Borden was secretary and agent for the Galveston City Company , which owned most of Galveston Island and for which he helped sell 2,500 lots.
He invented a "locomotive bath house" for Galveston women who wished to bathe in the Gulf of Mexico.
As an alderman he helped to rid the island temporarily of gamblers.
He and his first wife reputedly became the first Anglo-Americans to be baptized in the Gulf west of the Mississippi River.
He became Sunday school missionary to the poor and to travelers.
He was a trustee of the Texas Baptist Education Society, which founded Baylor University.
And he was an officer in the local temperance society and deacon and clerk of the local Baptist church.
In 1842 Borden directed insular defenses against an expected Mexican invasion.
In the middle 1840s he began inventing.
He is supposed to have experimented with large-scale refrigeration as a means of preventing yellow fever and with a terraqueous machine, a sort of prairie schooner that would go on land or water.
In 1849 he perfected a meat biscuit, made of dehydrated meat compounded with flour, which he tried to market on a worldwide scale in partnership with Ashbel Smith.
Although this project left him deeply in debt, for seven years Borden struggled to sell meat biscuits.
For this purpose he moved to New York in 1851 to be nearer trade centers.
In 1853 he sought a patent on a process for condensing milk in vacuum, but it was 1856 before he received American and British patents.
He then dropped the meat biscuit to devote himself to condensing milk.
He opened a factory in Connecticut in 1856 but failed, then tried and failed again in 1857.
Through Jeremiah Milbank, a New York financier, he received new backing and opened another factory in Connecticut in 1858.
When the Civil War brought intensified demand for condensed milk, sales grew so much that Borden's success was assured.
He opened another factory in Connecticut, two in New York, and one in Illinois and licensed other concerns in Pennsylvania and Maine.
He also invented processes for condensing various fruit juices, for extract of beef, and for coffee.
After the Civil War he established a meat-packing plant at Borden, Texas, twelve miles west of Columbus, and a sawmill and copperware factory at Bastrop.
After 1871 he spent his winters in Texas because of the milder climate.
In 1873 he built a freedmen's school and a white children's school, organized a day school and a Sunday school for black children, aided in constructing five churches, maintained two missionaries, and partially supported numerous poorly paid teachers, ministers, and students.
Borden married Penelope Mercer in Mississippi in 1828; they had seven children.
In 1845 he married Augusta Stearns, and in 1860 he married Emeline Eunice Church.
He died in Borden, Texas, on January 11, 1874; his body was shipped by private car to New York to be buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.
PUBLIC LANDS.
When Texas won independence, the republic made claim to approximately 251,579,800 acres of land.
Of this area only 26,280,000 acres had been previously disposed of in grants or sales by Spain or Mexico.
Thus the Republic of Texas originally claimed a public domain estimated at 225,299,800 acres.
There were, or came to be, three general categories of public lands: (1) the unappropriated public domain, which included all the virgin lands owned by the state prior to their disposition or appropriation, (2) the reserved submerged areas, and (3) the appropriated public lands.
In the early days of the republic the unappropriated public domain was considered the chief source of future public revenue.
The largest single land transaction made by Texas from the unappropriated public domain was the transfer to the United States in connection with the Compromise of 1850 of an estimated 67,000,000 acres in settlement of the boundary dispute, Texas receiving from the United States $10 million in bonds and in 1855 an additional $2,750,000 in cash.
This vast acreage became parts of New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming.
The transaction not only settled a burdensome state debt inherited from the republic, but also left Texas, unique among the states, with full control over her public domain.
Before and after this transaction attempts were made to sell lands to obtain revenue, but the results were disappointing.
Between 1835 and 1942 only slightly more than 55,000,000 acres, including then appropriated lands, was sold.
The total direct and indirect revenue received from the public domain according to the best available records during that period was $201,909,977.05.
Simultaneously, a policy of lavish land grants for social purposes was avidly pursued.
Approximately 86,570,733 acres, more than half the present area of Texas, was given away outright.
Of these land donations, the Republic of Texas gave away 41,570,733 acres and the state donated 44,457,370 acres.
By the end of the nineteenth century no unappropriated public domain remained in the state of Texas, but the lands held in the reserved area and the unsold residue of the appropriated public domain left the government still the largest landed proprietor in the state.
The reserved submerged area is composed of the beds of navigable rivers and lakes and the submerged coastal areas, which are permanently reserved to the state, with the minerals appropriated to the Permanent School Fund.
The annual receipts derived from the submerged areas alone often exceed the average yearly revenue obtained from the unappropriated public lands during the years they were on sale.
The United States Supreme Court in 1950 decreed federal ownership of the land in the Gulf of Mexico lying between the three-mile and three-league limits off the Texas coast.
This area, comprising an estimated 1,878,394 acres, was "returned" to Texas by a congressional act on May 23, 1953, and the Supreme Court finally confirmed state ownership of the area in a new court case on December 12, 1960.
The estimated off-shore portion of the reserved area, including beach areas, islands, land beneath bays and inlets, and submerged lands to the three-league limit, is 4,045,000 acres.
The total appropriation from the public domain to the public school fund, as of 1964, amounted to 42,561,400 acres.
The appropriated public domain is composed of all lands set apart for the public schools, the University of Texas System, and the eleemosynary institutions.
Texas appropriated to these institutions 51,921,519 acres, an area equal to about 30 percent of the total area of the state.
Even though these lands were dedicated to the endowment of public education, interests on them were frequently sacrificed to the social policy of encouraging home ownership.
Except for the 2,109,000 acres of unsold university lands and some scattered tracts of school lands, the appropriated public domain has disappeared.
Proceeds from the sale of this land have gone into the respective permanent funds of the institutions to which the lands were appropriated.
Mineral leases and royalties have also augmented the permanent funds.
The leasing of unsold appropriated lands has been a regular state policy since 1883; grazing rental accrues annually to the available funds of the various institutions.
Ironically, in the 1940s the all-but-vanished public lands were yielding more in rents, mineral rights, and royalties than in the heyday of public-land sales.
In 1992 the approximate book value of the Permanent University Fund stood at around $3.65 billion while the Permanent School Fund exceeded $7.9 billion.

Lost Battalion shipped to Singapore
On this day in 1942, 200 men of the Lost Battalion were shipped to Singapore as prisoners of war of the Japanese.
Most of the remaining battalion members followed nine days later.
The unit, the Second Battalion, 131st Field Artillery, originated as part of the Thirty-sixth Infantry Division, United States Army, in 1940 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt mobilized the Texas National Guard.
The division, which soon grew to almost 16,000 men from Texas and surrounding states, reported to Camp Bowie, near Brownwood.
After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Second Battalion, en route to the Philippines, was diverted to Australia and from there boarded a Dutch ship bound for Surabaya, Java, to provide ground support for the Nineteenth Heavy Bombardment Group.
The Second Battalion was left behind when the bomber group and other military forces were evacuated, earning the unit the title of the “Lost Battalion.”
When the Japanese captured the Dutch East Indies, they imprisoned the Texans, who thus began a harrowing trip to the work camps of Burma, where the men suffered brutality and death while laboring on various building projects including construction of the famous “Bridge over the River Kwai.”

Another chapter in Texas History
LOST BATTALION.
On August 27, 1940, as World War II engulfed both Europe and the Orient, a joint resolution of the United States Congress authorized President Franklin D. Roosevelt to federalize the National Guard.
Within days, Roosevelt issued orders for the mobilization of several state National Guard units.
The Texas National Guard began its tour of duty as the Thirty-sixth Infantry Division, United States Army, by reporting for federal active duty to Camp Bowie, near Brownwood, in the autumn of 1940.
Within weeks, the new division increased its manpower from 11,737 officers and men to nearly 15,800 by the addition of new officers and Selective Service inductees from Texas and the surrounding states.
The division participated in maneuvers in Louisiana during the summer of 1941.
After the Thirty-sixth returned from the war games, the army alerted the Second Battalion, 131st Field Artillery, for assignment.
On the evening of November 10, 1941, the battalion entrained at Camp Bowie en route to the West Coast; eleven days later the unit boarded the United States army transport Republic at San Francisco and joined a convoy bound for the Philippines.
The Republic was sailing west of Hawaii on December 7, 1941, when the troops learned of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
The convoy, still proceeding toward the Philippine Islands, which were under attack from another Japanese force, received orders to sail to Brisbane, Australia; the ships arrived there on December 22.
Six days later, the battalion was ordered to board a Dutch ship, the Bloemfontein, and sail to Surabaya, Java, to provide ground support for an army air force unit.
The Texans arrived on January 11, 1942, the same day the Japanese began invading the Dutch islands.
Initially, the battalion acted as ground crew for the Nineteenth Heavy Bombardment Group, which had been forced to leave its original support sections at Clark Field when fleeing the Philippines.
Shortly, when the bomb group was ordered to Australia, the flyers asked their leaders to allow the Texans to accompany them to Australia, since they were desperately needed.
But the Second Battalion was left in Java to support the morale of the people there.
The unit earned the title of "Lost Battalion" because they were not evacuated with other military forces.
The Dutch surrendered the islands on March 8, 1942.
The Japanese imprisoned the Texans, along with 5,500 British and Australian troops, at a camp called TanJong Priok, near Batavia.
Five weeks later the battalion marched to a new prison known as Bicycle Camp, where they encountered the first of many acts of Japanese brutality.
On October 2, 1942, nearly 200 battalion members were marched on board ship and transferred to Singapore.
Nine days later most of the remaining members followed, and the group was reunited at Changi Barracks POW camp, formerly a British army post, before being shipped to Moulmein, Burma, on January 11, 1943.
The Texans traveled by train to Thanbyuzayat, Burma, and immediately began work on the Japanese "Railroad of Death," which ultimately connected Burma to Bangkok, Siam.
The unit labored in various work camps on the railroad, including assisting on the famous "Bridge over the River Kwai," and suffered numerous casualties and deaths.
Seventy thousand Allied prisoners of all nationalities perished on the project.
In 1944 the Japanese transferred some of the Texans to prison camps in Cambodia and Vietnam and others to Bangkok, where the survivors of the Second Battalion remained for the rest of the war.
2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery
The Lost Battalion
The 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery was mobilized on 25 November 1940, along with the 36th Infantry Division, Texas National Guard, and was sent to Camp Bowie at Brownwood.
Originally intended to be part of a force to be sent to reinforce American troops in the Philippine Islands, the Battalion was detached from the 36th Infantry Battalion and sailed on the USS Republic on 21 November 1941.
The ship was diverted from the Philippines when Pearl Harbor was bombed on 7 December 1941, and landed on the island of Java in the Dutch East Indies on 11 January 1942, to reinforce Dutch, British and Australian troops already there.
The Japanese landed on the island and the Dutch surrendered on 8 March 1942 after token resistance.
The entire Battalion was taken prisoner.
The Battalion (less Battery E) and the survivors of the cruiser USS Houston, which had been sunk off the Java coast, were sent to Burma, Thailand or Japan to work for the Japanese as slave laborers.
They worked on the "Burma-Siam Death Railway" building a railroad through the jungle and in the coal mines, docks and ship yards in Japan and other southeast Asian countries.
They spent 42 months in captivity suffering humiliation; torture, both mental and physical; starvation and disease (without medication).
Five hundred and thirty two soldiers of the Battalion, along with 371 survivors of the USS Houston were taken prisoner.
Six hundred and sixty eight were sent to Burma and Thailand and 235 to other locations.
Altogether, 163 soldiers died in captivity and of those 133 died working on the railroad.
Many more died as a result of diseases contracted while in captivity after the war.
For almost three years, no one heard from any of the members of the battalion, hence the name, "Lost Battalion."
In late October 1944, a battalion (141st Infantry Regiment) from the 36th Texas Division was surrounded by the German army.
Battles were fought in the densely wooded Vosges mountains located in Northern France near the German border.
The Japanese American 442nd Regimental Combat Team (about 3,000 men) was ordered to rescue the Lost Battalion by General Clayton Dahlquist (commander of the 36th Division).
The German army had orders from Adolf Hitler to defend the Vosges at all costs.
The rescue mission would be one of the bloodiest battles in the history of the US Army.
1st Lt. Robert Foote led an infantry platoon in K Company 442nd.
Generally all officers attached to the 442nd were White but the NCO's were all Nisei's (second generation Japanese American).
"I always felt safe as long as I had one live Nisei soldier left in my company.
They would take care of me" said Foote.
He "was taken out of action early" in the battle when his platoon attempted to race across some railroad tracks outside the town of Bruyeres.
Foote was "blown into the air by a German mortar shell" that literally "landed in his hip pocket."
Foote was severely wounded and had to be evacuated to a hospital.
"Into the valley of death....." commented Foote.
Lt. Marty Higgins, a former "horse soldier" (cavalry), was in command of the Lost Battalion.
Higgins formed a strong defensive position on a hill and dug in.
Some 50 volunteers attempted to fight their way back to the American lines.
They were ambushed and only 5 men returned.
Higgins initially wanted to fight his way out of the trap but ruled against it because they didn't want to leave their wounded behind.
Although surrounded, morale was high.
Meanwhile food, medicine, ammunition and time was running out.
Lt. Susumu Ito was a forward observer with the 442nd's field artillery battalion (522nd FAB).
Ito's duties were to direct artillery fire from the batteries of 105 mm howitzers to support the 442nd infantry assaults up the rolling hills.
Prior to the battle, Ito received a battlefield commission to Lieutenant.
It was rare for Nisei to be promoted to officer status during WW2 for his role in the Italian Campaign.
Sgt. Wally Nunotani had volunteered for the 442nd from Hawaii.
Sgt. Nunotani was a section chief in the Cannon Company.
The small company was very close to the fighting.
Sometimes"we didn't want to shoot.
We could hit our own guys."
Nunotani saw an Me109 German fighter plane "hedge hopping over the lines".
During the cold rainy nights, the Nisei soldiers slept in foxholes.
It was "cold especially for Nisei who came from warm places."
"Water would accumulate in foxholes" so "guys would make roofs [over them]."
The roofs would also protect the soldiers from "tree bursts" where artillery shells would hit the trees showering the ground with thousands of splinters and shrapnel.
These roofs would "protect us from this type of attack."
Shig Doi from I Company was heavily involved in the fighting to rescue the Lost Battalion.
The Germans had machine gun nests in camouflaged positions so "they had to be pinpointed first.
You had to work yourself forward [toward them] then use a hand grenade [to knock them out].
If you fired your weapon, "you can expose yourself" to enemy fire.
If you fired too soon, "it's like saying 'Here I am.
"' When fighting in a dense forest, "everybody looks for [spare or extra] Tommy Guns" (Thompson sub machine gun).
A "handy, close fighting weapon" with "lots of knockout power" from its heavy 45 caliber slugs.
The fighting was from tree to tree and ridge to ridge.
The 442nd fought for yards at a time through dense woods shrouded with fog and rain.
On October 30th, 1944 the 442nd broke through the German lines rescuing the Lost Battalion after storming up Banzai Hill.
"We took a lot of losses" said Doi.
A German sniper shot a Nisei soldier right in front of him.
His friend moving near him was struck in the head and seriously wounded.
The sniper "could have picked me off at the same place."
Sometimes he wonders "How come I survived," commented Doi.
The Meaning of 'Courage Under Fire'
After the attack, Companies K, L, and I were down to less than 20 men standing each, out of 200 at full strength.
Only a handful of Nisei's that were still able to walk made contact with the Lost Battalion.
"I did not witness the first contact that was made by our riflemen but I did see several of the 36th Division fellows crawling out of their deep foxholes and with their bearded, bewildered look greet us with delight and relief," noted Ito.
"Saying we were thrilled is an understatement," commented Higgins.
At the end of the battle, General Dahlquist asked the 442nd to pass in review.
He asked where are all the men?
"Sorry sir... this is all we have left" replied a teary-eyed officer.
After days of near constant fighting the 442nd had suffered roughly 1,000 casualties.
200 soldiers were killed in action (or missing) with over 800 seriously wounded.
Nunotani was not clear on why the 442nd was sent in to rescue the Lost Battalion.
"There were other regiments that could have been used."
Sometimes war is "like being on a football team.
You go with the best and hope for the best," stated Nunotani.
For its heroic action in the Vosges, the 442nd received five Presidential Unit Citations.
When asked about the possibility of a US invasion of Iraq, some of the vets commented that they were against such an invasion since they are unclear about the Bush administration's objectives.
This is a "very foolhardy action" commented Nunotani.
He continued that if the Bush administration "goes in to get Hussein they will have to fight the whole country.
Sometimes the U.S. is like a bully in the world [trying to] impose its own way of life onto other cultures."
Doi added, "I went through it (war) being bombed and shelled.
These politicians glorify war but they are not the ones [that are] going.
War should be a last resort."
Doi also feared that "lots of civilians, innocent people" would be killed in Iraq.
World War II veterans are passing on at an alarming rate.
Many are in their early 80's.
Pretty soon there will be very few Nisei vets to tell the story of their heroic days fighting in the hills of Italy and France.
As the 442nd passes into legend their story of courage will always be remembered despite the fact their own country had discriminated against them.
"The Lost Battalion"

Rescue in the Vosges Mountains
Veterans of the 442d Regimental Combat Team take great pride in the accomplishments of their unit.
Still, many often refer to their role in World War II as being "cannon fodder" for the Germans.
Whether this perception is accurate or not, the events in the Vosges from October 15th to the 30th certainly gave the brave soldiers cause to believe it was true
In Italy the Purple Heart Battalion had become renown for suffering a record casualty rate.
In Italy, however, the Nisei had believed there were clear-cut objectives to be purchased with their blood and their sacrifice.
At Monte Cassino they had watched non-Japanese units, such as the 36th Infantry's 141st and 143d Regiments nearly decimated right next to them.
In France where the rain and fog in the Belmont forest obscured the terrain, in the Vosges Mountains many of the brave Nisei felt their orders and objectives were as vaguely defined.
From October 15th to 24th each Company had been thrown, almost in a scattered "shot-gun" pattern, at numerous hills and positions, with what they often felt was little clear-cut reason.
Frequently, as had been the case with Hill D, once they had purchased a position with their blood, they were moved on to the next assault only to watch hard-earned acreage fall back into enemy hands due to poor planning at the division level.
The outspoken Captain Kim had always stood up for the men, never defying orders, but often questioning them or offering more reasonable alternatives.
When rousted in the early morning hours of October 21st and ordered to move his weary soldiers into the ridge above Biffontaine, Kim had dutifully followed orders.
He didn't understand the reasoning behind them, indeed walked back to his jeep muttering "This is crazy.
This is crazy."
But, like all the men of the only World War II unit to be able to claim zero battlefield desertions during the war, he followed those orders.
As the weary regiment bedded down at Belmont on October 24th for what they hoped would be at least the two-day rest period they'd been promised, Kim was gone, recovering from his wounds at Biffontaine.
There must come, at some point in time, a limit to the endurance of the human spirit, mind, and body.
The Bruyeres-Biffontaine campaign had certainly pushed the young Nisei to that point.
For days they had tasted fear as they met the enemy, watched their comrades mutilated beyond recognition by enemy machinegun and artillery fire, and struggled to survive with few supplies and little support.
Those unwounded soldiers of the 442d that bedded down at Belmont carried scars deep inside their souls.
To add to their misery, the rain had been almost constant throughout the previous 8 days of combat.
Every man was soaked to the skin, the constant moisture turning flesh white and wrinkled.
The constant movement through the cold mud of the mountains had kept feet from drying for more than a week.
A new threat became as real as the armed enemy...trenchfoot...far worse than athlete's foot for it could not only immobilize a foot soldier, it could cost him the loss of a leg.
The campaign had also been costly for the enemy, 645 Germans captured and at least an equal number killed or wounded.
It had been a bitter defeat for them, right at their own door step.
At the American Army's Corps level it was determined that enemy resistance west of the Meurthe River had been effectively crushed.
Military planners at headquarters determined that the time was ripe to send the 3d Division, which had been in rest for ten days, in a push to reach the Meurthe River from St. Die.
Further south, the 36th Infantry was ordered to move east of Biffontaine to protect the 3d Division's right flank.
Even as the 442nd was pulling back to Belmont to heal, a unit consisting of Company A, Company B, and a portion of Company C (as well as one platoon from Company D) of the 1st Battalion, 141st Regiment of the 36th Infantry Division was moving eastward from Belmont to fulfill this task.
Joining the 274 T-Patchers was First Lieutenant Erwin Blonder, an artillery observer.
The 1st Battalion had moved out with dawn on October 24th, moving down a thickly wooded valley between Gerardmer and St. Die to rout the enemy from their hidden positions.
By mid-afternoon the soldiers had traveled nearly 6 miles into enemy territory, flanked by 3d Battalion on a ridge to the north.
Rising from the valley, the 1st Battalion attacked the heavily wooded hillsides, beating back the Germans.
Suddenly the enemy counter-attacked, splitting the two Battalions and cutting the 1st Battalion off from its flank support.
map_lostbn.
jpg (25819 bytes)   As night fell, 1st Battalion had taken a position on the barren crest of the densely wooded hilltop.
As they prepared for the long night, the battalion's officers held a war council.
Together with the NCOs, they asked each soldier to empty his pack, counting rations, supplies, and ammunition, then distributing them equally among the men.
So far forward was the unit that transmissions to the rear were scratchy and barely audible on Lieutenant Blonder's radio.
The officers could only hope that headquarters understood the coded message sent back that first night: "No rations, no water, no communications with headquarters...four litter cases."
As desperate as the situation sounded, the officers of the 1st Battalion did not realize yet just HOW critical their situation was.
First Sergeant Bill Hull sent a 36-man patrol to work their way back to friendly lines and obtain needed supplies for the men on the hilltop.
Almost immediately after leaving the perimeter, the patrol ran into the Germans.
The first hint of just how badly surrounded the 1st Battalion was came when only five of the thirty-six escaped to return to the hilltop.
In the darkness of that first night, the soldiers took turns standing guard duty.
But no one really slept.
They knew the enemy was near, that they were surrounded.
They suspected that they were also heavily outnumbered.
They were indeed.
Stinging from their defeat in the Belmont forest, the Germans had rushed a massive number of fresh, crack troops into the region.
During that first night it was later estimated that some 700 enemy soldiers moved in to surround the 1st Battalion.
At 10 o'clock the following morning the enemy revealed their presence.
Slowly a lone German tank moved through the forest to confront the American soldiers huddled in their small, muddy perimeter.
As the enemy began the frontal attack, the T-patchers met it with a hail of machinegun fire.
When the initial fusillade died down, the tank withdrew.
It had simply been a probe, an effort by the enemy to determine the strength of the surrounded Americans.
The charade would continue daily, almost like clock-work...a frontal assault by a lone German tank.
Each time the Americans met it with a hail of bullets, all the while knowing their supply of ammunition was getting lower.
Most felt that the only reason the Germans had not yet attacked in force was because they weren't sure how many Americans were on the hill.
Any sign of weakness, any lessening of the full resistance necessary to convince the Germans that they were up against a powerful Allied unit, would result in the battalion's immediate annihilation.
Throughout the day the soldiers continued to reinforce their position, digging foxholes into the ground and using knives to cut down trees for cover.
Every effort was made to maintain silence, for the Germans seemed to be everywhere.
Some of the soldiers resorted to wrapping blankets around small trees as they cut through the trunks, in order to quiet them as they fell.
Back at headquarters, Major General Dahlquist, Commander of the 36th Infantry Division, was concerned.
The situation faced by the 275 men he had sent from Belmont posed potential for a major military disaster.
Throughout the previous night, the 3d Battalion of the 141st had tried to fight their way in past the forces that had stopped 2nd Battalion from reaching the trapped unit.
It was all to no avail.
Quickly the Americans were learning how strong the reinforced German defenses had become.
"Hang on, a heavy force is coming to relieve you," headquarters radioed back to Lieutenant Blonder.
With his staff, General Dahlquist had committed all the resources of the 2d and 3d Battalions to the situation, while trying hard to determine what kind of manpower would be required to push through to the lonely hill where the majority of his 1st Battalion were huddled against the powerful German force.
On the hillside, the enemy was moving in more tanks, heavy guns, and dropping artillery fire on the their cornered prey.
In the forests they were blocking the advance of the American relief efforts.
The 1st Battalion wasn't really "lost", the Germans knew where they were, and so did General Dahlquist.
But knowing where the trapped unit was, and effecting their rescue, were two different problems.
Huddled in the mud protecting the radio that provided the Lost Battalions' only link to the rear, Lieutenant Blonder prayed for a miracle.
Back in Belmont, weary Nisei who had already been pushed beyond the limit of human endurance were rising up to do the impossible.
Sometimes when you go for broke, you win big.
At other times the roll of the dice can be cruel, and rob you of everything.
This time the roll of the dice would be insanely cruel, for men who
"Refused to Quit, Refused to Lose!"
October 25, 1944  (2:30 PM)
Belmont, France
Colonel Charles Pence knew something major was up the minute General Dahlquist walked into the 442d RCT's command post at Belmont.
The RCT commander wasn't surprised to see the division commander, visits from the General and his crisp aide Lieutenant Lewis, were common.
Today, however, Colonel Pence's attention was quickly drawn to the other officer with General Dahlquist.
It was hard to miss the three stars on the uniform of Lieutenant General Alexander Patch, commander of the 7th Army Corps.
Yes, something was definitely in the wind.
"I don't really want to send your soldiers to battle again, so soon," General Dahlquist told Colonel Pence, "But I have little choice."
With that, he ordered Second Battalion to move out before darkness fell, to assume a defensive position on the flank of the 141st Regiment.
From there, the General visited Lieutenant Colonel Singles at the 100th Battalion's command post.
He laid out the scenario being played out on the hilltop near La Houssiere, explaining the predicament of the Lost 1st Battalion and informed the Purple Heart Battalion's commander to have his soldiers ready to move out on a moments notice, should it be necessary to commit them to the rescue effort.
October 26, 1944
The 100th and the 3d Battalions remained for one more day at Belmont as the exhausted men of the 2d Battalion moved out in support of the 141st Regiment.
As dawn broke the skies on Thursday, October 26th, the Lost Battalion had survived its second night on the hill.
The beleaguered soldiers were under almost constant enemy artillery fire and most had not eaten in 24 hours.
Meanwhile, for two days the enemy had pushed back every effort by the rest of the 141st Regiment to reach their trapped comrades.
East of Belmont Technical Sergeant Charles Coolidge was covering 3d Battalions right flank.
His subsequent Medal of Honor citation explains much of the difficulty the "Texas Division" encountered:
Leading a section of heavy machineguns supported by 1 platoon of Company K, he took a position near Hill 623, east of Belmont sur Buttant, France, on 24 October 1944, with the mission of covering the right flank of the 3d Battalion and supporting its action.
T/Sgt.
Coolidge went forward with a sergeant of Company K to reconnoiter positions for coordinating the fires of the light and heavy machineguns.
They ran into an enemy force in the woods estimated to be an infantry company.
T/Sgt.
Coolidge, attempting to bluff the Germans by a show of assurance and boldness called upon them to surrender, whereupon the enemy opened fire.
With his carbine, T/Sgt.
Coolidge wounded 2 of them.
There being no officer present with the force, T/Sgt.
Coolidge at once assumed command.
Many of the men were replacements recently arrived; this was their first experience under fire.
T/Sgt.
Coolidge, unmindful of the enemy fire delivered at close range, walked along the position, calming and encouraging his men and directing their fire.
The attack was thrown back.
Through 25 and 26 October the enemy launched repeated attacks against the position of this combat group but each was repulsed due to T/Sgt.
Coolidge's able leadership.
On 27 October, German infantry, supported by 2 tanks, made a determined attack on the position.
The area was swept by enemy small arms, machinegun, and tank fire.
T/Sgt.
Coolidge armed himself with a bazooka and advanced to within 25 yards of the tanks.
His bazooka failed to function and he threw it aside.
Securing all the hand grenades he could carry, he crawled forward and inflicted heavy casualties on the advancing enemy.
Finally it became apparent that the enemy, in greatly superior force, supported by tanks, would overrun the position.
T/Sgt.
Coolidge, displaying great coolness and courage, directed and conducted an orderly withdrawal, being himself the last to leave the position.
As a result of T/Sgt.
Coolidge's heroic and superior leadership, the mission of this combat group was accomplished throughout 4 days of continuous fighting against numerically superior enemy troops in rain and cold and amid dense woods.
The men of the 442d's Second Battalion were ordered to move out in front of the 141st's Third Battalion.
Though the Nisei themselves were not yet aware of the plight of the Lost Battalion or the reason for the move, it was the first step in a series of actions that would place their fate in the hands of the Go For Broke regiment.
Lieutenant Blonder knew the men were getting desperate.
It was possible to survive for a period without food, but the men needed water.
When possible, rainwater was collected from shell holes on the hilltop.
Further down the hill was a larger pond that had accumulated considerable water from the incessant precipitation.
The water was green and foul tasting, but it was water.
At night the Americans would try to slip through the forest to haul back the much needed water.
They did so with their weapons gripped tightly, their senses alert.
The Germans controlled the forested sides of the hill, and drew water from the same hole.
October 27, 1944
Back at Belmont, at 2:00 A.M., the two remaining battalions of the 442d Regimental Combat Team were alerted.
Two hours later the 3d Battalion moved out and into the darkness of the forest.
An hour later the 100th Battalion followed.
Every other effort to relieve the Lost Battalion had failed.
Now it would be up to a group of soldiers who had left more than a week of combat two days earlier, to accomplish what no one else seemed able to do.
Still the Nisei were not aware of the nature of their mission, the lives that depended upon their success.
But as they moved out of Belmont it was hard to miss the line of ambulances and built up aid stations that had been assembled for the eventual rescue.
It was an eerie symbol of what lay ahead.
Moving into the forest, it was almost impossible to see.
The soldiers created a human chain, each man holding the straps of the pack ahead of him.
Sliding down muddy trails, forcing their way through dense brush, and stumbling over sharp rocks, the Nisei walked obediently into the jaws of certain death.
All three battalions moved slowly northward in the direction of St. Die, to approach the La Houssier position from the northwest.
Third Battalion, already far forward, would make the drive down the middle with the 100th and 2d Battalions guarding the flanks.
On that first day, a heavy concentration of German 88mm fire tore into the men of the 3d Battalion, causing numerous casualties.
Still, the brave men fought on.
In the forests, the Germans seemed to be fighting with increased intensity.
The German high command had become aware that their soldiers in the Vosges had trapped nearly an entire American battalion and Adolf Hitler had personally issued orders to stop any rescue effort.
October 28, 1944
The three battalions of the of the 442d spent their first full night back in the forest trying to hold their positions and stay alive.
Their orders were to attack at daylight, in what General Dahlquist expected to be an aggressive and swift push to snatch the Lost Battalion out of harms way.
During the night the enemy moved reinforcements, including heavy armor into the valley to turn back the Americans.
When the attack commenced at 6:30, it was still dark in the forest.
Suddenly the darkness came alive with the brilliant flashes of enemy artillery.
Company K took two hours to push forward some 350 yards when an enemy mortar left several brave soldiers lying in the mud, dead and dying.
By mid-morning platoon sergeant George Nishi was the only NCO left in the unit.
As he attempted to pull his men back a grenade landed in his foxhole.
Quickly he tossed it back at the enemy.
A second grenade came in his direction, killing the young soldier behind him.
Nishi was wounded in the back.
Shortly before noon, after receiving orders from General Dahlquist, Colonel Pence ordered Company L out of reserve.
The division commander was desperate, the destruction of his "Lost Battalion" would be a major catastrophe.
Not only did the General order an unrelenting frontal assault by the 442d regardless of cost, he went to the front himself...issuing orders and pushing men forward.
To many of the Nisei, none of whom still were aware that their mission was one to rescue a lost battalion of friendlies, it was senseless.
It was difficult to see themselves as anything other than cannon-fodder, expendable in the push through the Vosges.
The battle raged through the morning.
Artillery support was requested.
On the right flank the 100th battled through the forest.
First Lieutenant James Boodry, the battalion S-3, was killed by an air-burst as he huddled next to Charlie Company Commander Bill Pye mapping out the forward strategy of the battalion.
Boodry had replaced Kim when the latter was wounded at Biffontaine by bullets meant for Pye.
The same shrapnel that split open the head of Lieutenant Boodry, also wounded the Charlie Company commander.
Reeling in horror, blood streaming from his wounds, Pye moved forward.
Minutes later the fierce enemy fire reached out to him again.
He would go no further into the Vosges, one leg shattered by an enemy shell.
Everywhere, casualties were falling...to enemy fire...to artillery fire...to mines and booby traps.
Technician Fifth Grade James Okubo was a medic.
All the medics of the 442d had gained the respect of the soldiers time and again, going into the open to recover wounded, hoping that the enemy would respect their non-combatant status.
Sometimes it worked...sometimes it didn't.
As the Nisei advanced on the enemy they were faced first with minefields and roadblocks, behind which the enemy could hide and rain leaden death on the advancing Americans.
One hundred fifty yards ahead of Okubo lay wounded soldiers, within 40 yards of the enemy lines.
Despite the heavy fire he crawled forward time and again.
Two grenades landed near him but he ignored the danger they represented.
In all he rescued and treated 17 men.
As darkness fell again over the forest, even Lieutenant Colonel Singles was wounded.
The same shell that peppered his body with hot metal as it struck his jeep had killed the passenger next to him and wounded another.
After two days of horrible fighting, two lieutenants were all that remained to command the entire battalion.
During the night a patrol of twelve men was sent through the darkness to the rear to obtain badly needed ammunition and supplies.
The patrol was unable to finish their important task.
Two were killed and the remaining ten all wounded.
Lieutenant Blonder huddled next to the radio as dusk fell on the battalion's fifth night alone on the barren hilltop.
Freshly turned dirt revealed the place where earlier in the day, his men had buried three more of their own.
He had made it a practice to send out only two radio messages each day in an effort to spare the battery of the one precious link the men had with the rear.
His messages were always the same: "Send us medical supplies."
"We need rations."
" Please, we need fresh Water."
"I need radio batteries."
"My wounded need plasma."
Every morning the enemy tank had appeared.
Throughout the day and night, enemy artillery fell on their small 350 yard defensive position.
During the day a flight of P47 fighter-bombers of the XII Tactical Air Combat Wing flew over to drop supplies.
The stranded soldiers on the ground waved white underwear and popped smoke grenades to guide them in.
None-the-less, few of the supplies landed in the small perimeter, and much of the supplies that were on target quickly rolled down the hillside and into the hands of the enemy.
That evening an American 105 artillery round whistled through the air, homing in on top of the men of the Lost Battalion.
Buried in the nose of the warhead in place of explosives, was chocolate.
It was a bizarre, desperate effort to get some nourishment to embattled soldiers who had not eaten in a week.
The velocity of the shell caused the chocolate to burrow deep into the mud upon impact.
It was a novel idea, a good effort, but like all other efforts to provide relief to the Lost Battalion, it had failed.
The survivors on the hillside had no way of knowing that the men of the Go For Broke regiment were slugging their way to reach them.
They could only hope and pray that tomorrow they we see friendly faces breaking through the forest below them.
With dawn they would face their sixth day alone in enemy territory.
Though they prayed that day six would bring rescue, instead it would only bring the worst yet....both for the men on the hill and the brave Nisei coming to their rescue.
October 29, 1944
For the first time the men of the 442d Regimental Combat Team were made aware of the fate of the Lost Battalion and their mission.
With that knowledge came some understanding of the events of the previous days.
For the men of the 100th who had been cut off and surrounded at Biffontaine, there was a special sense of identity with the 36th Infantry's "Lost Battalion."
It steeled the resolve of the surviving Nisei to push forward.
It also helped to explain the division commander's frustration and drive in the field.
The men of the 442nd knew that General Dahlquist, despite all his perceived shortcomings in the way he used the Nisei unit, did not lack in courage.
Field commanders had become accustom to seeing top brass in the field on occasion.
They were not accustom to seeing the commander so close to the fighting, so often.
During the effort to rescue the Lost Battalion, the division commander was desperate to bring the mission to a successful conclusion.
The darkest day yet for the Nisei would also be the General's darkest moment.
At dawn the 100th and 3d Battalion launched their attack, running directly into heavy resistance supported by enemy armor.
It was the small Nisei infantrymen going head to head with multi-ton, steel fortresses of death.
The brave soldiers never wavered.
At eight in the morning General Dahlquist urged Colonel Singles to push his men onward.
"There's a battalion about to die up there (in the mountains) and we've got to reach them."
Before noon the General had arrived at the scene of the fighting with his young aide, Lieutenant Lewis.
As Colonel Singles and the division commander viewed the terrain, an enemy machinegun some 40 yards away opened fire.
Twenty-seven year old Wells Lewis, the eldest son of the first American to receive the Nobel prize for literature Sinclair Lewis, fell dead...his blood splattering the uniform of his commanding general.
It was a blow to the General from which he never fully recovered.
Still, he remained in the field to issue orders and command the Nisei forward.
In the valleys the Go For Broke Regiment's 232d Combat Engineers fought through the mud to shore up roadways with logs.
Along the hillsides they cleared minefields and booby traps.
Wounded were everywhere.
James Okubo, the medic who had braved enemy fire the day before to rescue 17 men continued his courageous efforts in the face of enemy fire to rescue 8 more.
His actions the previous day combined with his actions on the 29th to save a total of 25 wounded Nisei.
He would survive to wear his Silver Star medal, but before his war would end there would be more lives to save.
Lieutenant Colonel Pursall of the 3d Battalion ordered Companies I and K to assault the high ground.
His men were hesitant to move from the safety of their foxholes, knowing the assault would be deadly and useless.
Standing in the open, bareheaded without a helmet, the Battalion commander raised his .45 Army Colt pistol and said, "Okay, boys, let's go."
as he led the way forward in classic John Wayne style.
Second Lieutenant Edward Davis was the only officer left in company K.  Slowly he rose to his feet as the Nisei around him watched in amazement.
All knew the order to assault the enemy above them would be suicidal and were reluctant to move further.
The lieutenant turned to Sergeant Kohashi and asked, not ordered, the NCO to follow him.
Then something amazing happened.
Sergeant Kohashi rose to his feet with a loud yell of desperation that reverberated across the hillside.
It shook the Japanese-American soldiers to the soul, eliciting similar cries.
As a unit the Nisei leaped screaming to their feet in a "banzai" charge against the Germans.
recip_hajiro.
jpg (12046 bytes)In his own sector, Private Barney Hajiro rose to his feet to lead his own assault.
Next to him was a friend he had known since basic training, Takeyasu "Thomas" Onaga".
As they moved forward young Hajiro watched in horror as the close friend who moments earlier had loaded his browning automatic rifle, fell dead to a hail of enemy bullets.
The young private who had already twice demonstrated the highest degree of valor could contain the torment of his soul no longer.
With abandon he assaulted "suicide hill", yards ahead of the other men of his platoon, raining the rounds his dead comrade had loaded in the BAR on the enemy.
Camouflage netting could not hide the enemy gunners from the fury of his assault, nor could the continuous stream of enemy machinegun fire turn back his determination.
Private Barney Hajiro quickly knocked out two enemy gun emplacements and shot two snipers, allowing the rest of his unit to advance.
Then enemy rounds slammed into Private Hajiro's left arm, rendering it useless.
Fifty-six years later that arm still hung at his side, helplessly paralyzed, as the President presented Barney Hajiro the Medal of Honor for his actions on October 19th, 20th, and 29th.
Every Memorial Day for those 56 years Mr. Hijiro has visited Thomas Onaga's grave site at the Punchbowl in Hawaii.
Barney Hajiro believes, despite the permanent loss of the use of his left arm, that he was the fortunate soldier that fateful day.
The banzai charge on "suicide hill" consumed an hour.
The Nisei suffered many casualties, but by 3:30 they had taken the hill.
Those enemy soldiers who had been wounded or otherwise unable to escape the hill cowered in fear before the survivors of the onslaught.
Never had they seen such courage, such fierce determination, such sheer force of will-power in the face of unbelievable odds.
These kinds of banzai charges, when looked upon in retrospect, further reveal the desperation to which the men of the 442d had been pushed.
Pulled out of the line one day after concluding their 8-days of continuous combat to liberate Breyeres and Biffontaine, suffering the physical maladies forced upon them by the cold, wet weather, and driven beyond human endurance to accomplish what two previous regiments had been unable to do, their situation appeared hopeless.
Many believed that relief would come only when they had freed the Lost Battalion or when the 442d Regiment had been destroyed to the man.
They were beaten beyond emotion, yet they could not help the emotions that rose up within their breast at the horrible slaughter around them.
Mr. George Sakato, a retired postal worker from Denver, Colorado looked back on October 29, 1944 fifty-six years later and summed the events up by saying, "Nowadays, they call it road rage."
He should know, for he was there.
His eyes still fill with tears whenever he is asked to recall the events of that day, reflecting the emotion of an event not reflected in his Medal of Honor citation.
The men of Private Sakato's platoon from E Company knew their objective only as Hill 617.
Sakato's citation tells how the men moved forward to take the hill, destroying two enemy positions.
Private Sakato personally killed five enemy soldiers and captured four more.
Then the enemy counter attacked.
As the enemy launched their renewed assault, George turned to Saburo and told him to watch out for a machine gun.
It was too late.
The enemy rounds slammed into his friend, ripping flesh and spilling blood.
As Saburo Tanamachi died in Sakato's arms, tears welled up within the young private's eyes.
A rage began to boil deep within as he gently lowered his friend's lifeless body to the ground.
Tears continuing to blur his vision he leaped to his feet, heedless of the enemy fire that tore into the brush around him, to launch his one-man assault on the Germans.
Using an enemy rifle and P-38 pistol he charged headlong into the counter-attack, killing 12 enemy, wounding two more and capturing four.
Inspired by Private Sakato's brazen assault, his platoon followed, retaking the hill and capturing 34 prisoners.
In all, Companies E and F killed 100 enemy and captured 41 in the taking of Hill 617.
JUST HOW CLOSE WAS THE ENEMY.
If there was any doubt, the question was answered on the morning of October 29th.
During the darkness of the previous night one of the Americans had been huddling in his foxhole when he felt another soldier climb in next to him.
Exhausted, both men fell asleep, content to share the wet hole in the ground and to share their body heat.
When the American awakened at daylight he saw his bedmate for the first time.
It was a German soldier who, in the darkness had wandered into the small perimeter and taken shelter with the Americans, believing they were his German comrades.
Not only had the Lost Battalion survived their fifth night, they captured a prisoner.
Lieutenant Blonder was worried.
Despite nearly a week without food and sustained by only the brackish water drawn from shell holes, in spite of the hopelessness of their position, the men were holding up reasonable well.
Most sincerely believed, even after six days with no respite, that help was on the way.
What worried Lieutenant Blonder was that the Germans probably knew by now, how few and how desperate were the men of the Lost Battalion.
The attempt at an air drop the previous day certainly had sent a message to they enemy as to the dire straits of the men they had surrounded.
To his chagrin, he was correct.
The attack began with an artillery barrage.
The men on the hill had been subjected to constant shelling for six days, but this was the worst yet.
And then they came, moving through the brush to attack in force.
Fortunately, the enemy while now realizing how helpless the battalion was, did not know where they had placed their heavy machineguns.
By chance they made their assault on the most heavily defended area of the American perimeter.
The gunners restrained themselves, firing single-shot bursts as the enemy came closer.
Then, when the encroaching force was almost upon the defenders, the Lost Battalion cut loose with everything they had.
The hillside was littered with the bodies of enemy soldiers, the attack thwarted, as the men of the Lost Battalion settled in for their sixth night in hell.
October 30, 1944
It was the fifth day in the forest for the soldiers of the 442d as 3d Battalion led the way.
The rain that had fallen virtually every day since October 15th began to turn to snow altering conditions from bad to worse.
Time was running out for the Lost Battalion and, equally important, the "cavalry" was running out of men to send to their rescue.
What remained of the 3d Battalion's I and K Companies joined with B and C Companies of the 100th to sweep down the ridge that led to the position of the Lost Battalion.
To the left, the 2d Battalion was moving on the flank to dig out enemy soldiers and protect the efforts on the ridge.
Men of the 232d Engineers and the 522d Artillery were fighting as infantrymen, many replacing lost soldiers in the battered line companies.
It would have been a beautiful display of complete teamwork by the Regiment, a tribute to their personal maturity since the squabbles months earlier when the 2d and 3d Battalion arrived in Italy, were it not for the sad loss of so many team members.
Leading the way was the decimated remains of I Company, which soon ran into a roadblock manned by 50 enemy.
K Company moved over to assist their badly outnumbered comrades, killing and routing the enemy and destroying the roadblock.
Then, despite their fatigue, the Nisei moved on.
Only two platoons remained in I Company which had been fully staffed at the beginning of the rescue mission, a company of 205 men:  First Platoon consisting of six men, and Second Platoon containing two.
The highest ranking officer of the 8-man company was an NCO, Sergeant Tak Senzaki.
Shortly after 2 O'clock, it was these men who finally broke through to the Lost Battalion.
Private First Class Matt Sakumoto was the point man, the first friendly face the 211 survivors of the surrounded battalion had seen in a week.
As the Nisei enlisted man walked past the first T-patcher he noticed the man's lips begin to quiver and his eyes fill with tears.
He stared with relief and numbed shock at the miracle that had appeared out of the forest in the Vosges mountains.
It was an emotion charged moment of silence...what can one say at a time like that.
Turning to the mud blacked face, tears streaming down the cheeks from sunken eyes, Pfc Sakumoto could only say, "Want a smoke?"
Minutes later the rest of I Company broke through, and was joined shortly thereafter by K Company...or what remained of K company...17 men.
In all the Nisei had lost 800 men in five days of battle to rescue 211.
Sergeant Senzaki didn't allow his men time to reflect in their accomplishment, for the enemy was still nearby.
He ordered his 8-man company to move on to take up defensive positions on the far side of the hill to protect the men so many of his brothers had sacrificed to reach.
Within an hour the Lost Battalion was on its way down the other side, into the shelter of the waiting aid stations and the spotlight of a battery of newsmen.
For those who survived it was one of those experiences that stamps itself indelibly on the subconscious, never to be forgotten.
For the 442d Regiment Combat Team, in a series of war time accomplishments unprecedented in military history, it was
A Defining Moment.

Albert Sydney Johnston
General joins ranks with artist
On this day in 1843, Albert Sidney Johnston married Eliza Griffin.
Johnston, born in Kentucky in 1803, had moved to Texas in 1836 and served as secretary of war for the Republic of Texas under President Mirabeau B. Lamar in 1838.
In 1840 Johnston returned to Kentucky where he later married Eliza Griffin, a Virginia native eighteen years his junior.
She was an accomplished musician and artist.
The couple settled at Johnston’s China Grove plantation in Brazoria County and later lived in Austin.
They had six children.
After Albert took command of the U.S. Army’s newly formed Second Cavalry regiment, Eliza kept a diary of her travels with her husband and his regiment from Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, to Fort Mason, Texas, and described daily life, foods, flowers, and hardships of the journey, as well as various military personalities who became famous during the Civil War.
Albert resigned his commission at the beginning of the Civil War and was appointed a general in the Confederate Army.
He was killed at the battle of Shiloh in Tennessee in 1862.
Eliza died in 1896.
Texas Wildflowers, a book of her watercolor paintings of flowers, was published in 1972.

Another chapter in Texas History
ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON (1803–1862).
Albert Sidney Johnston, Confederate general, son of John and Abigail (Harris) Johnston, was born at Washington, Kentucky, on February 2, 1803.
He attended Transylvania University before he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, from which he graduated in June 1826.
He served at Sackett's Harbor, New York, in 1826, with the Sixth Infantry at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, in 1827, and as regimental adjutant in the Black Hawk War.
On January 20, 1829, he married Henrietta Preston.
Because of his wife's illness, he resigned his commission on April 22, 1834, and farmed near St. Louis in 1835.
She died on August 12, 1835.
In 1836 Johnston moved to Texas and enlisted as a private in the Texas Army.
On August 5, 1836, he was appointed adjutant general by Thomas Jefferson Rusk and on January 31, 1837, he became senior brigadier general in command of the army to replace Felix Huston.
A duel with Huston resulted; Johnston was wounded and could not immediately take the command.
On December 22, 1838, he was appointed secretary of war for the Republic of Texas by President Mirabeau B. Lamar, and in December 1839 he led an expedition against the Cherokee Indians in East Texas.
On March 1, 1840, Johnston returned to Kentucky, where, on October 3, 1843, he married Eliza Griffin, a cousin of his first wife.
They returned to Texas to settle at China Grove Plantation in Brazoria County.
During the Mexican War he was colonel of the First Texas Rifle Volunteers and served with W. O. Butler as inspector general at Monterrey, Mexico.
On December 2, 1849, Johnston became paymaster in the United States Army and was assigned to the Texas frontier.
He went with William S. Harney to the Great Plains in 1855, and on April 2, 1856, he was appointed colonel of the Second Cavalry.
In 1858 Johnston received command of a Utah expedition to escort a new territorial governor and three judges to Salt Lake City and to establish a military presence, due to Morman resistance of federal authority.
He set up Camp Scott near the ruins of Fort Bridger in the fall of 1858, and later selected a site southwest of Salt Lake City for a permanent camp—Camp Floyd which was dedicated in November of 1859.
Johnston remained in charge of Camp Floyd until 1860 when he was sent to the Pacific Department and stationed at San Francisco.
At the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, he resigned his commission in the United States Army, refused the federal government's offer of a command, and returned overland to Texas.
In Austin 1861 Jefferson Davis appointed Johnston a general in the Confederate Army and in September assigned him command of the Western Department.
Johnston issued a call for men and formed and drilled an army, but it lacked men and organization, had a huge area to defend, and could not control the rivers that were vital to military success in the region.
In February 1862, following Federal victories on the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers, he moved his line of defense to the vicinity of Nashville, Tennessee, and later to Corinth, Mississippi.
On April 6, 1862, he was killed while leading his forces at the battle of Shiloh.
He was temporarily buried at New Orleans.
By special appropriation, the Texas Legislature, in January 1867, had his remains transferred to Austin for burial in the State Cemetery.
In 1905 a stone monument executed by noted sculptor Elisabet Ney was erected at the site.
Albert Sydney Johnston
Albert Sidney Johnston
(1803-1862)
At the beginning of the Civil War it was almost universally agreed that the finest soldier, North or South, was Albert Sidney Johnston.
But his Civil War career was a definite disappointment to the Confederacy.
The Kentucky-born Johnston was appointed to West Point from Louisiana and graduated eighth in the class of 1826.
After eight years of service he resigned to care for his terminally ill wife.
A failure at farming, he went to Texas and joined the revolutionary forces as a private.
He rose to the forces' chief command as senior brigadier the next year.
He served as secretary of war in the Republic of Texas and commanded the lst Texas Rifles in the Mexican War.
Reentering the regular army in 1849 as a major and paymaster, he became colonel, 2nd (old) Cavalry, in 185 5.
For his services in the 1857 campaign against the Mormons in Utah he was brevetted brigadier general.
He resigned his commission on April 10, 1861, but did not quit his post on the West Coast until his successor arrived.
Relieved, he began the long trek to Richmond overland.
Meeting with Jefferson Davis, he entered Confederate service where his assignments included: general, CSA (August 30, 1861, to date from May 30, 1861); commanding Department No. 2 (September 15, 1861 - April 6, 1862); and in immediate command of the Central Army of Kentucky, Department No. 2 (October 28 - December 5, 1861 and February 23- March 29, 1862).
As the second ranking general in the Southern army he was given command of the western theater of operations.
Establishing a line of defense in Kentucky from the Mississippi River to the Appalachians, he held it until it was broken at Mill Springs in January and at Forts Henry and Donelson in February 1862.
Abandoning Kentucky and most of Tennessee, he fell back into northern Mississippi where he concentrated his previously scattered forces.
In early April he moved against Grant's army at Shiloh.
In what was basically a surprise attack, he drove the enemy back.
While directing frontline operations he was wounded in the leg.
Not considering his wound serious, he bled to death.
Grant, writing in his memoirs, considered Johnston as having failed to live up to earlier expectations.
(Roland, Charles P., Albert Sidney Johnston: Soldier of Tbree Republics)
Albert Sidney Johnston  CSA
GENERAL
FEBRUARY 2, 1803 – APRIL 6, 1862
In 1837, Albert Sidney Johnston survived a duel against Texas Brigadier General Felix Huston.
Unfortunately, the effects of his wound probably contributed to his death at the Battle of Shiloh in 1862.
Johnston has the unfortunate distinction of being the highest ranking general – on either side – killed during the Civil War.
Johnston already had an eventful military career by the time his home state seceded from the Union.
He fought in the Black Hawk War, the Texas Revolution, and the Mexican-American War, and in actions against the Mormons in Utah and Native Americans in northern Texas.
On December 21, 1860, Johnston took command of the Department of the Pacific.
He resigned on April 9, 1861, when his home state of Texas seceded from the Union.
Still, he stayed at his post until his successor arrived.
Accompanied by the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles, Johnston began a lengthy, dangerous journey across the desert in June.
He arrived in Richmond in September, and his long-time friend, Jefferson Davis, made him a full general and commander of the Western Department.
He held a line of defense from Kentucky’s Cumberland Gap to the town of Columbus.
In February 1862, US Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and Flag Officer A.H. Foote captured Fort Henry (on the Tennessee River).
Grant then proceeded to capture Fort Donelson (on the Cumberland River).
As such, the Union controlled both rivers and Johnston’s defensive line became impossible to hold.
His forces moved to Corinth, MS, where they joined General P.G.T. Beauregard.
Meanwhile, Grant’s army was stationed at Pittsburg Landing.
Johnston intended to attack Grant on April 5, 1862, but he was held back by heavy rains.
His Army attacked on April 6, near Shiloh Church.
He was successful, at first, in pushing Gen. William T. Sherman’s men back to an area called the Crossroads.
The Hornet’s Nest, just north of this point, saw the bloodiest fighting.
Johnston was shot in the leg when he rode too far ahead of his troops.
Because he’d suffered nerve damage from his dueling wound, he didn’t realize the severity of his injury until his boot filled with blood.
He quickly bled to death on the battlefield.
It is said that he had a tourniquet in his pocket when he died.
Johnston was buried temporarily in New Orleans.
His journey finally ended in 1867 when his remains were taken to the State Cemetery in Austin, Texas.
ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON
Albert Sidney Johnston (1803-1862) was a U.S. and Texas military officer who served as a Confederate general during the Civil War (1861-65).
A veteran of the Black Hawk War (1832), Johnston resigned from the U.S. Army in 1834.
He served in the Texas Army during the Texas Revolution (1835-36) and as a colonel of Texas volunteers during the Mexican-American War (1846-48).
He was reappointed to the U.S. Army in 1849 and led troops during the Utah War (1857-58) before joining the Confederacy at the start of the Civil War in 1861.
Johnston was appointed a full general and served in the war’s Western Theater as commander of all Confederate troops between Texas and the Appalachian Mountains.
Following a string of Confederate losses in early 1862, Johnston engaged Union forces at the Battle of Shiloh (April 6-7, 1862).
The battle ended in a Union victory and Johnston was mortally wounded.
He died at the age of 59.
ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON: EARLY LIFE
Albert Sidney Johnston was born in Washington, Kentucky, on February 2, 1803.
After attending Transylvania University in Lexington, Johnston was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1822.
He graduated in 1826, finishing eighth in his class of 41.
DID YOU KNOW?
During his long military career, Albert Sidney Johnston took part in three major wars and served as a general in three separate armies: the Texas Army, the U.S. Army and the Confederate Army.
Johnston was commissioned in the U.S. Army as a brevet second lieutenant and spent time in New York and Missouri before serving during the Black Hawk War (1832), a brief conflict between United States militia units and a band of Sauk, Meskwaki and Kickapoo Native Americans.
Johnston had married his first wife, Henrietta Preston, in 1829, and in 1834 he resigned from the military to care for her until her death from tuberculosis in 1836.
ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON: TEXAS REVOLUTION AND LATER MILITARY CAREER
Johnston moved to the new republic of Texas in 1836 and enlisted as a private in its army during the Texas Revolution (1835-36).
Johnston swiftly rose to the rank of senior brigadier general, replacing General Felix Huston in January 1837.
A quarrel over the position led to a duel between the two officers in which Johnston was wounded in the hip.
Johnston would later serve as secretary of war in the Republic of Texas from 1838 to 1840.
Johnston resigned in 1840 and returned to his home state of Kentucky.
In 1843 he married Eliza Griffin, the cousin of his first wife, and settled in Galveston, Texas.
He later served as a colonel of Texas volunteers during the Mexican-American War (1846-48) and was cited for bravery during the Battle of Monterrey.
After the admission of Texas to the United States, Johnston was reappointed as a major in the U.S. Army and served as a paymaster.
He was later promoted to colonel in the 2nd U.S. Cavalry and led operations against the Comanche on the Texas frontier.
In 1856 Johnston led a U.S. military force to confront Brigham Young and his Mormon followers, who had clashed with the United States over governance of the Utah Territory.
The resulting intervention—known as the Utah War (1857-58)—avoided bloodshed and succeeded in removing Young as governor of the territory.
Johnston was promoted to brevet brigadier general in 1857, and in December 1860 he was transferred to California, where he commanded the Department of the Pacific.

Johnston resigned from the U.S. Army in May 1861 after his adopted state of Texas seceded from the Union.
As a former U.S. Army general, the 58-year-old Johnston was considered one of the South’s senior officers.
He was highly respected by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, a former classmate at West Point, and became one of only eight Confederate officers to receive the rank of full general.
Johnston was placed in command of Confederate Department No. 2, which encompassed a vast swath of the South from the Appalachian Mountains to Texas and included jurisdiction over the Civil War’s Western Theater.
Johnston was considered by many of his contemporaries to be the finest soldier on either side of the conflict, but his early performance in the Civil War drew some criticisms.
Although he was initially successful in raising an army and positioning it against a much larger Union force, Johnston’s thin defensive line in Kentucky was soon broken in February 1862.
Following Union general Ulysses S. Grant’s capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson—two vital Confederate strongholds on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers—Johnston was forced to effectively abandon Kentucky and Tennessee and fall back into the Deep South.
ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON: DEATH AT THE BATTLE OF SHILOH
Johnston concentrated his army around the rail junction at Corinth, Mississippi, where he rendezvoused with the forces of his subordinate P.G.T. Beauregard.
Meanwhile, Ulysses S. Grant’s army moved further south via the Tennessee River with the intention of capturing the vital Memphis and Charleston Railroad.
Recognizing an opportunity to catch the Union forces by surprise, Johnston executed a massive offensive near Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, on April 6, 1862.
In the ensuing engagement at the Battle of Shiloh, Johnston’s 45,000 Confederates made early gains, collapsing Grant’s front lines and pushing his army north toward the Tennessee River with a series of bold charges.
Recognizing that his inexperienced troops would be hesitant to fight, Johnston elected to lead one of the later offensives himself.
During a charge on the afternoon of April 6 he was wounded in the back of the knee—possibly by his own men.
The bullet struck an artery, and Johnston bled to death before he could receive medical attention.
It was later speculated that nerve damage from his old dueling wound prevented Johnston from recognizing the severity of his injury until it was too late.
Beauregard would take over as commanding officer for the remainder of the Battle of Shiloh, the bloodiest engagement of the war up to that point.
His decision to delay further attacks until the next day allowed Grant’s army to gain reinforcements and turn the tide of the battle with a counterattack, securing a Union victory.
Johnston’s death at the age of 59 was seen as a major blow to the Confederacy.
By the end of the war in 1865, he remained the highest-ranking officer on either side to have been killed in action.
Eliza Griffin Johnston
ELIZA GRIFFIN JOHNSTON (1821–1896).
Eliza Griffin Johnston, artist and diarist, the second wife of Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, was born in Fincastle, Virginia, on December 26, 1821, the youngest child and only daughter of John Caswell and Mary (Hancock) Griffin.
Her parents died when she was about four years old, and she was raised by her grandmother, Margaret Strother Hancock, and later her uncle, Col. George Hancock, who moved to Kentucky in 1830.
Eliza completed her education at a prestigious school in Philadelphia.
In addition to learning social graces, she became an artist and an accomplished musician.
She also developed a familiarity with several languages and could read and speak French fluently.
She was a cousin by marriage of Albert Sidney Johnston, who began courting her when she was about eighteen.
They were married on October 3, 1843.
In November they went on the first of many journeys to Texas.
After dividing the first two years of their married life between Texas and Kentucky, the couple, with their baby son, moved to Galveston.
They later settled on Johnston's plantation, China Grove, forty miles from Galveston, where they lived in a double log cabin for about three years.
In her free time Mrs. Johnston painted watercolors of birds and flowers.
She wrote, "I think myself as much of a fixture in Texas as one of its live oaks."
Two children were born on the plantation.
Unable to meet mortgage payments, the Johnstons were forced to leave China Grove, and the plantation was sold at auction.
The family returned to Kentucky in the spring of 1850, but moved to Texas once again when Albert became army paymaster for the Department of Texas.
They settled in Austin, where Eliza spent her leisure time painting plants and flowers.
A daughter was born there.
By lobbying President Franklin Pierce and Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, Eliza and other family members helped Johnston receive the appointment to command the newly formed Second Cavalry regiment.
She kept a diary in the fall of 1855 and winter of 1856 as she traveled with her husband and his regiment from Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, to Fort Mason, on the Texas frontier, more than 700 miles away.
It is the best source of information on the regiment's journey.
She described the hardships of the march, camp life, foods, plants, flowers, illnesses, and death.
The diary also gives clues to the personalities of many military men who became famous in the Civil War.
The Johnstons spent the next several years in Texas.
In November 1860 Johnston was given command of the Department of California, and the family moved to San Francisco.
When Texas seceded from the Union he resigned his commission, and the family moved to Los Angeles, where Eliza's brother, Dr. John S. Griffin, a retired military surgeon, resided.
A sixth child was born two months after Johnston left California to join the Confederacy.
After he was killed at Shiloh in April 1862, Eliza raised their remaining five children on her own.
In 1894 she donated relics of her husband and family to the Daughters of the Republic of Texas.
The donation included a book she had compiled for her husband of watercolors of Texas wildflowers she had painted in the 1840s and 1850s.
She continued to reside in Los Angeles until her death on September 25, 1896.
Texas Wild Flowers, a book of 101 of her paintings, was published in 1972.
Eliza Johnston
Wife of Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston
painting of Eliza JohnstonEliza Griffin Johnston, the second wife of General Albert Sidney Johnston, was educated at a prestigious school in Philadelphia.
In addition to learning social graces, she became an accomplished artist and musician.
As a wife and mother Mrs. Johnston painted watercolors of birds and flowers in her free time.
Eliza Griffin was born in Fair Oaks, Virginia, on December 26, 1821, to a well-to-do family.
She was the youngest child and the only daughter of John and Mary (Hancock) Griffin.
Eliza's parents died when she was four years old, and she was raised by her grandmother, Margaret Strother Hancock.
After her grandmother's death in 1830, she moved to Kentucky to live with her uncle, Colonel George Hancock, and there she later met her future husband, Albert Sidney Johnston.
Eliza completed her education at a prestigious school in Philadelphia.
In addition to learning the social graces, she became an artist and an accomplished musician.
She was a woman of great beauty, high courage and fine talents.
She also developed a familiarity with several languages, and could read and speak French fluently.
Albert Sidney Johnston, the son of John and Abigail (Harris) Johnston, was born at Washington, Kentucky, on February 2, 1803.
Educated locally through his younger years, Johnston enrolled at Transylvania University in the 1820s.
While there he befriended the future president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis.
Davis and Johnston soon transferred to US Military Academy at West Point.
Two years Davis' junior, he graduated in 1826, ranked 8th in a class of 41.
Accepting a commission as a brevet second lieutenant, Johnston was posted to the 2nd US Infantry.
He served at Sackett's Harbor, New York in 1826, and with the Sixth Infantry at Jefferson Barracks in Missouri in 1827.
On January 20, 1829, Sidney Johnston married Henrietta Preston, and they had a son, William Preston Johnston.
Because of his wife's tuberculosis, Sidney resigned his commission in the army on April 22, 1834.
For more than a year, he cared for his wife and farmed near St. Louis.
Henrietta died on August 12, 1835.
Johnston served as General Henry Atkinson's chief of staff during the 1832 Black Hawk War, and was quickly recognized as a gifted officer.
In 1836, he moved to Texas and enlisted as a private in the Texas Army.
One month later, he was promoted to major, and aide-de-camp to General Sam Houston.
On January 31, 1837, he became senior brigadier general of the entire Texas army.
In February 1837, Johnston was challenged to a duel by General Felix Huston, the man he had replaced as senior brigadier.
Johnston refused to fire, but Huston shot him in the pelvis, and he was unable to take his new command.
Johnston's wound was quite severe, and it took months for him to recover.
The bullet injured his sciatic nerve, which resulted in some loss of feeling in his right leg and foot.
He was next appointed Secretary of War for the Republic of Texas on December 22, 1838.
In March 1840, Albert Sidney Johnston returned to Kentucky and lived there several years.
He was Eliza Griffin's cousin by marriage, and he began courting her when she was eighteen years old.
Eliza Griffin married Johnston on October 3, 1843.
In November, the Johnstons went on the first of many journeys to Texas.
After dividing the first two years of their married life between Texas and Kentucky, the couple and their infant son moved to Galveston.
They later settled on Johnston's plantation, China Grove, forty miles from Galveston, where they lived in a double log cabin for about three years.
Two children were born on the plantation.
With the outbreak of the Mexican-American War in 1846, Sidney Johnston reenlisted in the United States Army, and raised a volunteer regiment, and was commissioned as Colonel of the First Texas Rifle Volunteers and served in Monterrey as inspector general.
He saw action during the campaigns in northeastern Mexico, and on December 2, 1849, became paymaster in the United States Army and was assigned to the Texas frontier.
Unable to pay their mortgage, the Johnstons were forced to leave China Grove, and the plantation was sold at auction.
The family returned to Kentucky in the spring of 1850, but moved to Texas once again when Sidney became army paymaster for the Department of Texas.
They settled in Austin, and a daughter was born there.
Eliza traveled with her husband during many of his assignments throughout the Western frontier, and she developed skills as an accomplished artist.
In Texas, she spent her leisure time painting watercolors of birds and flowers.
She wrote, "I think myself as much of a fixture in Texas as one of its live oaks."
Eliza kept a diary in the fall of 1854 and winter of 1855 as she traveled with her husband and his regiment – from Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, to Fort Mason on the Texas frontier, more than 700 miles away.
She described the hardships of the march, camp life, foods, plants, flowers, illnesses and death.
Her diary also gives clues to the personalities of many military men who would become famous in the Civil War.
Johnston went with William S. Harney to the Great Plains in 1855, and on April 2, 1856, he was appointed colonel of the Second Cavalry.
In 1857, Johnston was appointed commander of a US military campaign to crush the Mormon rebellion.
The Mormons had established a theocracy in Utah, and would not submit to US government when the US claimed Utah as a territory.
Johnston put down the rebellion without a major conflict.
In November 1860, he was promoted to brigadier general, and was given command of the Department of the Pacific, based in San Francisco.
The three-week voyage to California was rough, Eliza was seasick most of the time, and she reached San Francisco "much reduced and feeble."
But, the harrowing passage was soon forgotten in the family's enthusiasm for their new home.
The schools were good, and the climate was mild.
Eliza was charmed by San Francisco, the surrounding countryside, and the demographics.
The Civil War
With the secession of Texas in early 1861, Sidney Johnston refused the federal government's offer of a command, and resigned his commission in the United States Army.
Eliza and the children had moved to San Francisco to be with him, and they moved to Los Angeles at the urging of her brother, Dr. John Griffin, a retired military surgeon who had large land holdings in the Los Angeles area.
A sixth child was born there, two months after Johnston left California to join the Confederacy.
Sidney Johnston displayed the erect carriage of a professional soldier.
He was tall with a deep chest, and broad shoulders.
His light brown hair was graying a little, and his handsome face, deeply bronzed by the sun, was etched with wrinkles.
But he looked much younger than his fifty-eight years, and he always gave off an air of total confidence.
He had just completed an arduous journey of more than 3,000 miles across the continent, much of it on horseback, but he did not seem the least bit haggard.
Johnston traveled to Richmond, Virginia, where Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him a general in the Confederate Army and assigned him to command the Western Department, in charge of Confederate operations in Tennessee and Kentucky.
General Albert Sidney Johnston took Bowling Green, Kentucky, as his base of operations, issued a call for volunteers, and worked on honing them into soldiers.
His subordinate generals lost Forts Henry and Donelson on February 16, 1862, to Union Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant.
Johnston has been faulted for poor judgment in selecting Brigadier Generals Tilghman and Floyd for those crucial positions and for not supervising adequate construction of the forts.
The Battle of Shiloh
CSA General P.G.T. Beauregard was sent west to join Johnston, and they organized their forces at Corinth, Mississippi, planning to ambush Grant's forces at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee.
At dawn on April 6, 1862, Johnston unleashed his attack on Grant's unsuspecting army near a small church called Shiloh.
With his corps in stacked formation, Johnston initially experienced success, pushing USA General William Tecumseh Sherman's division past Shiloh Church to an area known as the Crossroads.
The most brutal fighting thus far in the Civil War took place just north of the Crossroads, in an area now known as the Hornet's Nest.
By all accounts, Johnston was performing brilliantly on the field.
As he encouraged his men, General Johnston rode slowly down the line.
His voice was persuasive, encouraging, and compelling.
His words were few: "Men, they are stubborn; we must use the bayonet."
When he reached the center of the line, he turned.
"I will lead you!"
he cried, and moved toward the enemy.
With a mighty shout, the line moved forward at a charge.
He passed through the ordeal seemingly unhurt.
His horse was shot in four places; his clothes were pierced by missiles; and his boot-sole was cut and torn by a minie ball.
In the meantime, groups of Federal soldiers kept up a desultory fire as they retreated, and delivered volley after volley as they retreated.
While Johnston was leading an attack in the area of the Peach Orchard, around 2:00 pm, he was struck behind his right knee by a minie ball.
Believing his injury to not be serious, he did not seek medical attention.
It is possible that the injury he had received at the duel twenty-five years earlier had caused nerve damage or numbness to that leg, and that he did not feel the wound.
Within a few minutes, Johnston suddenly became very pale.
One of his staff asked him, "General, are you wounded?"
He answered, in a very deliberate and emphatic tone: "Yes, and I fear seriously."
These were his last words.
His aides helped him dismount from his horse, and carried him to a small ravine nearby.
The bullet had severed his popliteal artery, and his boot was quickly filling up with blood.
Tennessee Governor Isham Harris was an officer on General Johnston's staff.
This is his account of the incident:
I galloped back to the general, where a moment before I had left him, rode up to his right side, and said, "General, your order is delivered, and Colonel Statham is in motion;" but, as I was uttering this sentence, the general reeled from me in a manner that indicated he was falling from his horse.
I put my left arm around his neck, grasping the collar of his coat, and righted him up in the saddle, bending forward as I did so, and, looking him in the face, said, "General, are you wounded?"
In a very deliberate and emphatic tone he answered, "Yes, and I fear seriously."
At that moment, I requested Captain Wickham to go with all possible speed for a surgeon.
The general's hold upon his rein relaxed, and it dropped from his hand.
Supporting him with my left hand, I gathered his rein with my right, in which I held my own, and guided both horses to a valley about 150 yards in rear of our line, where I halted, dropped myself between the two horses, pulling the general over upon me, and eased him to the ground as gently as I could.
When laid upon the ground, with eager anxiety I asked many questions about his wounds, to which he gave no answer, not even a look of intelligence.
Supporting his head with one hand, I untied his cravat, unbuttoned his collar and vest, and tore his shirts open with the other, for the purpose of finding the wound, feeling confident from his condition that he had a more serious wound than the one which I knew was bleeding profusely in the right leg; but I found no other, and, as I afterward ascertained, he had no other.
Raising his head, I poured a little brandy into his mouth, which he swallowed, and in a few moments I repeated the brandy, but he made no effort to swallow; it gurgled in his throat in his effort to breathe, and I turned his head so as to relieve him.
In a few moments he ceased to breathe.
I did not consult my watch, but my impression is that he did not live more than thirty or forty minutes from the time he received the wound.
He died calmly, and, to all appearances, free from pain - indeed, so calmly, that the only evidence I had that he had passed from life was the fact that he ceased to breathe, and the heart ceased to throb.
There was not the slightest struggle, nor the contortion of a muscle; his features were as calm and as natural as at any time in life and health.
General Johnston's wound need not have been fatal.
His own knowledge of military surgery was adequate enough to have saved his life by applying a tourniquet, if he had been aware of its seriousness.
His personal physician, Dr. D. W. Yandell, had been with him in the morning; but when the general saw a large number of wounded men, including many Union soldiers, he had ordered Yandell to stop and establish a field hospital.
He said to Yandell: "These men were our enemies a moment ago; they are prisoners now.
Take care of them."
Yandell argued against leaving him, but the general insisted.
Had Yandell remained with him, he would have had little difficulty controlling the bleeding.
General Albert Sidney Johnston died within minutes on the Shiloh battlefield on April 6, 1862, of massive blood loss.
He was the highest ranking Confederate officer killed during the Civil War.
Although he had not lived long enough for his leadership potential to be tested, his death was nonetheless a major loss to the Confederacy, and left a void in the leadership of the western armies that was never effectively filled.
The man whom Jefferson Davis had called the Confederacy's finest general was laid to rest in New Orleans.
In 1867, by special appropriation of the Texas Legislature, Johnston's remains were re-interred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin with full honors, in recognition of his service to Texas.
At the Battle of Shiloh that day, after General Johnston fell mortally wounded, command was passed to General P.G.T. Beauregard, who lost the Battle of Shiloh on April 7, when a reinforced Federal army overran his position, pushing him clear to Corinth.
Thereafter, the war in the West would be dominated by the Federal armies.
General Randall Gibson wrote:
General Johnston's death was a tremendous catastrophe.
There are no words adequate to express my own conception of the immensity of the loss to our country.
Sometimes the hopes of millions of people depend upon one head and one arm.
The West perished with Albert Sidney Johnston, and the Southern country followed.
Eliza Johnston decided to stay in California.
She bought a piece of property from her brother for $1,000, near what is today Pasadena, and brought up her family there.
She named it the Fair Oaks Ranch, after her native city in Virginia and also for the stands of coast live oaks in the area.
In 1864, tragedy struck again, when Eliza's beloved son was killed in the explosion of a boiler on the steamship Ada Hancock at Wilmington Harbor, California.
Heartbroken, she sold the Fair Oaks Ranch and went home to Virginia.
In 1894, Eliza donated relics of her husband and family to the Daughters of the Republic of Texas.
The donation included a book she had compiled for her husband of the watercolor paintings of Texas wildflowers she had painted in the 1840s and 1850s.
Eliza Griffin Johnston preserved her striking personality to the last, and continued to reside in Los Angeles until her death on September 25, 1896.
Her children inherited much of her artistic talent.

October 4 in Texas History….
.
Colonel William Peleg Rogers
Texas hero falls at Battery Robinett
On this day in 1862, on the second day of the battle of Corinth, Mississippi, Confederate general Earl Van Dorn called for a series of headlong frontal attacks against a heavily fortified federal position.
Col. William Peleg Rogers of the Second Texas Infantry was ordered to lead the vanguard of the assault on Battery Robinett, a small fort anchoring the center of the Union line.
After one bloody repulse, Rogers led a second desperate charge.
Remaining on horseback in the face of a barrage of cannon and musket fire, and finally carrying the regimental colors himself, Rogers reached the deep trench fronting Battery Robinett, dismounted, and led several hundred Texans and Alabamans down into the trench, up the steep embankment, and into the fort.
Suddenly federal reinforcements closed in from both flanks.
Rogers shouted, "Men, save yourselves or sell your lives as dearly as possible."
A few seconds later he was struck by multiple rifle shots and died instantly.
Scores of others fell with him, and the battle soon ended.
The Second Texas Infantry had lost more than half its numbers in casualties.
The failure of Rogers's attack sealed Van Dorn's defeat at Corinth.
In a remarkable tribute to Rogers's personal bravery, Union general William S. Rosecrans ordered his burial attended with full military honors, a ceremony normally reserved only for Confederate general officers.

Another chapter in Texas History
WILLIAM PELEG ROGERS (1819–1862).
William Peleg Rogers, lawyer, political activist, and Confederate officer, son of Timothy Lincoln and Mary (Miles) Rogers, was born on December 27, 1819, in Georgia, during a visit there by his parents, who were living in Alabama at the time.
Soon afterward, the Rogers family settled on a plantation near Aberdeen, Monroe County, Mississippi.
According to his father's wishes, William P. Rogers attended and graduated from a medical college in Kentucky and began practicing medicine in Pontotoc County, Mississippi.
Soon afterward he began studying law on his own while also editing a pro-Whig Party newspaper in Aberdeen.
On January 15, 1840, Rogers married Martha Halbert from Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
He was admitted to the Mississippi state bar in 1842 and began practicing law.
Anxious to participate in the Mexican War, in the summer of 1846 Rogers became captain in command of Company K of the First Mississippi Volunteer Infantry Regiment, popularly known as the "Mississippi Rifles," commanded by Col. Jefferson Davis.
The regiment joined Gen. Zachary Taylor's small army in northern Mexico and soon saw action against the Mexicans.
Rogers was one of the first to scale the walls of the fort at Monterrey on September 21 and again performed well during the climactic victory at Buena Vista on February 1847.
Throughout the campaign, however, Rogers not only defied Jefferson Davis over the manner in which Davis used Rogers's company in battle, but he also felt personally slighted in Davis's and Taylor's official reports describing the fighting.
At the same time, Rogers developed a haughty revulsion toward the hardships of army camp routine.
"I am more than tired of a soldier's life," he wrote in his diary, "I am disgusted with it."
Soon after the war Rogers became a candidate for the clerkship of the Mississippi Chancery Court but lost the election.
He also failed to gain an appointment as a federal marshal.
In 1849 he had decided to run for state auditor, when President Zachary Taylor, his former commander, surprised Rogers by generously appointing him United States Consul at the port of Veracruz in Mexico.
His wife, however, refused to go beyond Texas with their six children, so Rogers went to Veracruz alone.
In September 1851 he abruptly resigned as consul in anger over false allegations that one of his agents had embezzled federal funds.
Returning to Texas, he joined his family at Washington-on-the-Brazos, where he quickly rose to prominence as a practicing defense attorney.
At nearby Independence in 1857 he donated part of his time over three years as one of three professors in the new law department of Baylor University.
A Baptist upbringing influenced all of Rogers's children in their eventually becoming Baylor graduates.
Rogers moved his family to Houston in 1859, where he became a Democrat fearful of the North's growing anti-slavery movement.
Rogers supported his close friend and legal client Sam Houston in his governor's race in 1859 and his presidential ambitions in 1860, but Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency in November 1860 prompted Rogers join the radical pro-slavery secessionists.
He was elected a delegate from Harris County to the Texas secession convention and signed the ordinance of secession on February 1, 1861.
He then served on the committee that demanded compliance from Governor Houston, who soon resigned rather than affirm secession.
After offering his services to the Confederate War Department, Rogers was tendered a colonelcy in command of the First Texas Infantry, a unit destined for Virginia.
At his wife's insistence, however, he accepted a commission as lieutenant colonel of the Second Texas Infantry, commanded by Col. John Creed Moore.
The regiment joined Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston's Army of the Mississippi barely in time for the battle of Shiloh in Tennessee, April 6 and 7, 1862, where the Second Texas lost more than one third of its men in casualties.
"The gallantry of our regiment is spoken of by all," Rogers wrote to wife.
Upon Moore's promotion to brigadier general, Rogers was promoted to colonel and given command of the regiment.
In August 1862 the principal officers from at least twenty regiments in the army addressed a letter to the War Department urging Rogers's promotion to major general and command of a division.
Although he knew that President Jefferson Davis, his nemesis from the Mexican War, would probably ignore the petition, Rogers valued the officers' recommendation as "a very high compliment."
During the fall of 1862 the Confederate attempt to retake northern Mississippi and western Tennessee hinged upon Gen. Earl Van Dorn's ability to use his army of 22,000 southerners, including the Second Texas Infantry, in dislodging Gen. William S. Rosecrans's firmly entrenched force of 23,000 men at Corinth, Mississippi, the region's most strategically vital railroad hub.
On the morning of October 4 an impatient Van Dorn called for a series of headlong frontal attacks against the enemy's heavily fortified position.
Colonel Rogers's divisional commander, Gen. Dabney H. Maury, who later described the Second Texas Infantry as "one of the finest regiments I have ever seen," ordered Rogers to lead the vanguard of the assault on Battery Robinett, a small fort anchoring the center of the Union line.
After one bloody repulse, Rogers led a second desperate charge.
Remaining on horseback in the face of a barrage of cannon and musket fire, and finally carrying the regimental colors himself, Rogers reached the deep trench fronting Battery Robinett, dismounted, and led several hundred Texans and Alabamians down into the trench, up the steep embankment, and into the fort.
Suddenly federal reinforcements closed in from both flanks.
Rogers shouted, "Men, save yourselves or sell your lives as dearly as possible."
A few seconds later he was struck by multiple rifle shots, killing him instantly.
Scores of others fell with him, and the battle soon ended.
The Second Texas Infantry had lost more than half its numbers in casualties.
The failure of Rogers's attack sealed Van Dorn's defeat at Corinth and insured a powerful federal thrust toward Vicksburg the following year.
In a remarkable tribute to Rogers's personal bravery, General Rosecrans ordered his burial attended with full military honors, a ceremony normally reserved only for Confederate general officers.
In 1912 the United Daughters of the Confederacy, together with several Rogers family descendants, dedicated a white marble obelisk to mark his gravesite atop a hill overlooking the battlefield.
The Bravest Man: Colonel William P. Rogers
Colonel William Peleg Rogers
William P. Rogers was born in 1819 in Georgia, but grew up in Alabama and later Mississippi.
His father wanted him to become a doctor.
Rogers graduated medical school and practiced medicine for a short time before becoming an attorney.
He joined the army during the Mexican War and was made a captain in the 1st Mississippi Infantry.
That regiment was commanded by Jefferson Davis, the future president of the Confederacy.
Rogers proved to be an excellent leader, but he had trouble with Davis as his commander.
Davis had to control every part of his regiment down to the smallest detail.
Although Rogers had performed admirably during two battles, Davis slighted the man in his reports.
The war ended with both men having a strong dislike of each other and ironically both would return home a war hero.
Rogers moved to Texas and worked as an attorney and dabbled in politics until the Civil War began.
He was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the Second Texas Infantry and saw his first action at the Battle of Shiloh.
There the regiment lost over one-third of its men.
General Hardee called the regiment a "bunch of cowards".
Rogers took offense to the statement and vowed to prove Hardee wrong.
Rogers would be promoted to colonel and over the next few months the commanders of over twenty regiments petitioned President Davis to make Rogers a general.
Rogers was pleased with the recommendation, but deep down he knew Davis would never make him a general.
Battery Robinette
William Rogers most glorious moment would occur at the Battle of Corinth on October 4, 1862.
He was given the task of leading the assault on Battery Robinette.
Riding in front of his regiment, he shouted, "Forward, Texans!"
He led the regiment from the tree line and across the field at a slow steady march.
The Federals described the sight of the Confederates slowly moving toward them as nerve grating.
Colonel Rogers rode in front of his line as cool as if he were leading his men to dress parade.
Within a hundred yards of the earthen fort the Federals opened fire.
Men went down by scores.
Rogers ordered his regiment to charge.
They were forced to fight through abatis and over the dirt walls.
Four of his color-bearers had been killed, so Rogers dismounted and picked up the flag.
With his pistol in one hand and the flag in the other, he climbed the wall and planted his regiments colors on the parapet.
Over half of his men were shot down within minutes.
William Rogers realized there was no way he could hold the position.
He shouted, "Men, save yourselves or sell your lives as dearly as possible!"
Those would be his last words.
Despite wearing a bullet proof vest, Rogers would be killed.
One of the bullets penetrated his body near the arm where the vest didn't cover.
He was killed instantly.
Following the battle, General Rosecrans, the Federal commander would come to Battery Robinette to see the brave colonel.
Rosecrans would become known for denying Confederates a burial with military honors, but not Colonel Rogers.
Rosecrans said, "He was one of the bravest men that ever led a charge.
Bury him with military honors and mark his grave, so his friends can claim him.
The time will come when there will be a monument here to commemorate his bravery.”
Rosecrans would be correct in that prediction.
Today there stands a large obelisk just a few yards from Battery Robinette marking the grave of the brave Texas colonel.
Colonel John Daly of the Eighteenth Arkansas would also be killed assaulting the fort.
No one would ever accuse the Second Texas of cowardice again.

Colonel William Rogers
It was October 4th, 1862, and Colonel William Rogers, who'd spent most of his life in Mississippi, had come home as commander of the Second Texas Infantry to wrest control of the important railway hub of Corinth from the hated Yankees.
It had been considered an insult when William Rosecrans and his Union army captured and occupied northern Mississippi and western Tennessee, and Earl Van Dorn was determined to do something about it with men like William Rogers leading the way.
They would start with Corinth.
Colonel William P. Rogers
William Peleg Rogers was born December 27th, 1819.
Different references give different birthdates but the one given by his daughter in her writings is considered accurate.
He was actually born in Georgia while his Alabamian parents were visiting there.
However, soon after his birth, the family settled on a plantation near Aberdeen, Monroe County, Mississippi, and Rogers always considered himself a Mississippian.
William Rogers ethnicity has always been a subject of debate, but most believe he was part Chickasaw Indian, and he was said to be half brother to Sam Houston's wife, Tiana Rogers, who was half Cherokee.
The Mexican War, which began in 1846, would launch Rogers on his military career, and also demonstrate his aggressive personality and his inordinate sense of fair play.
This would bring him into conflict with Jefferson Davis, whom Rogers felt used his command improperly.
Considering that Rogers was the first to scale the walls of the fort at Monterrey, and that he and his command performed admirably during the victory at Buena Vista in February of 1847, his complaints seem justified.
But Davis, a petulant man, never forgave Rogers and this was no doubt the reason that Rogers was only a colonel, leading troops into battle somewhere behind the lines on an October day in 1862, rather than a major general, as many thought he should have been.
When the Mexican War ended, Rogers returned to his wife and six children in Mississippi, only to find that his brilliant war record carried little weight in his home state.
He lost an election for Clerk of the Chancery Court and was turned down in his quest for appointment as a federal marshal.
He was about to run for election as state auditor when his friend and former commander in the Mexican War, Zachary Taylor, tossed him a political plum by appointing him United States Consul at the port of Vera Cruz in Mexico in 1849.
Martha promptly informed him that she would not take her children out of the United States, and would go only as far as the new (1845) state of Texas; forcing Rogers to go to Vera Cruz alone.
Things went well until 1851, when false allegations that one of his agents had embezzled federal funds, forcing his abrupt resignation.
Impugning his character was the ultimate insult to a man like Rogers.
He returned to his family at Washington-on-the-Brazos, and quickly became a man of prominence as a defense attorney.
He also became a professor in the law department at Baylor University.
In 1859, he moved to Houston, where he became a fixture in the secessionist movement, causing a split between himself and relative such as Governor Sam Houston, who had labored mightily to get Texas into the Union and then keep her there.
Rogers signed the ordinance of secession on February 1st, 1861 and would soon become a soldier in the new Confederacy.
At his wife's insistence, Rogers turned down a colonel's commission in the First Texas Infantry, since it would have taken him to Virginia, but accepted the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Second Texas, destined for the western theater of operations.
No doubt in that day, Virginia seemed a world away to Martha and she wanted her husband a little closer to home.
Combat was not long in coming, and Rogers would soon be leading the Second Texas into battle at Shiloh, Tennessee on April 6th, 1862.
It's been said that the bloody battle of Shiloh caused both sides to realize that it would be a long and costly war; and this was no doubt brought home to Rogers as the Second Texas lost one third of its men.
"The gallantry of our regiment is spoken by all" Rogers wrote to Martha.
He was promoted to full colonel.
In August of that year, the officers of twenty regiments addressed a letter to the Confederate War Department asking that Rogers be promoted to major general.
Rogers told his compatriots he was honored, but he knew that now President Davis would never accede to their request.
Corinth, Mississippi, where the Memphis and Charleston railroads and the Mobile and Ohio railroads intersected, was considered to be of extreme importance by both armies for its strategic value, and had psychological value for the South.
It was from Corinth that General Albert Sidney Johnson led his army to do battle at Shiloh, and it was to Corinth that his defeated army retreated.
But they could not stay due to lack of supplies and no hope of obtaining any.
Under cover of night, they withdrew and the Federal army of William Starke Rosecrans moved in.
Earl Van Dorn, over the objections of Sterling Price, had been named commander of the Confederate armies of the west.
Van Dorn had a reputation as a brave but impatient officer who was not very open to advice from his subordinates.
Van Dorn was impatient to recapture Corinth, and in mid September, wired Sterling Price, asking that Price move his army to Ripley, Mississippi, just thirty-five miles southwest of Corinth, where Van Dorn and his command were waiting.
Together they would form plans for the retaking of Corinth.
At their meeting, Price suggested waiting until fifteen thousand exchanged prisoners now in Jackson could be added to the twenty-two thousand troops now available.
But Van Dorn did not want to wait, believing that a surprise attack on Corinth before the Yankees had time to strengthen their defenses would bring victory.
It was a bad miscalculation.
William Rosecrans, master planner that he was, already knew of the Rebel army to his south, due to reconnaissance by his cavalry.
His only mistake was believing he faced forty thousand Rebels, but this worked in his favor, as he called in all available reinforcements, bringing his total to twenty-five thousand.
He now outnumbered Van Dorn.
Meanwhile, Van Dorn, who thought his movements toward Corinth disguised his intentions as to just where he was going to attack, ran into a problem when he found the bridge across the Hatchie River partially destroyed.
He was slowly losing any hope of surprise, and lost all hope of surprise when he ran into a force of reconnoitering Federal cavalry.
Another commander might have reconsidered, but Van Dorn was intent on retaking Corinth.
He called his officers together and described his intentions.
All became disgruntled when they realized they would be attacking a prepared enemy.
Sterling Price would later say that only one person wanted to go through with the attack – Earl Van Dorn himself.
Van Dorn would actually be attacking a series of defense lines, some built by the South and some by the North.
Confederate General Beauregard had built the original line of light defensive entrenchments two-and-a-half miles from Corinth, that extended around the line in an arc.
During the Union occupation, Major General Halleck, who loved building entrenchments, had built another line one-and-a-half miles from the city, and the key to Corinth, a strongly built system of breastworks and gun emplacements, constituted a third line.
The key to this last line was two exceptionally strong positions, known as Battery Williams and Battery Robinette.
At battle's end, whoever held these two positions would be the victor.
At 10am on October 3rd, 1862, the battle for Corinth begins.
The first day goes surprisingly well for the Confederates and they carry Rosecrans' outer defenses.
Nightfall finds Van Dorn's army drawn up in battle line around the inner defenses of Corinth.
But again Van Dorn has miscalculated, overestimating himself and underestimating his enemy.
While all of his army has been engaged during the first days fighting, he doesn't realize he will be facing fresh Union troops in the morning.
He is so flush with victory that he wires Richmond – "We have driven the enemy from every position.
So far all is glorious, our men have behaved nobly."
At 4am October 4th, the Rebel army is awakened and heartened by their artillery shelling Yankee positions.
But with dawn they quickly become disheartened when they see what awaits them.
To their four-hundred yard wide front lies an abatis of felled trees with the branches interlaced, causing one Rebel to say – "the most obstructive abatis it was my misfortune to see during the entire war."
Behind the abatis is Battery Robinette, in front of which is a six-foot high wall of dirt and directly in front of the wall of dirt is a ditch six-feet deep.
Robinette has three twenty-pound siege guns, and not far away on a hill is Battery Williams with its four twenty-pound siege guns and two eight-inch howitzers trained directly in front of Robinette.
On the crest of that hill waits Battery F of the 2nd U.S. Light Artillery with its six guns also trained on the clearing in front of Robinette.
Just down from Battery F is infantry, the 47th Illinois armed with Springfield rifles.
The 43rd Ohio and the 11th Missouri man breastworks that flank Batteries Williams and Robinette.
To the right of Robinette is the 63rd Ohio.
North of the breastworks are two more artillery batteries.
General Maury's command, which includes William Rogers, now an acting brigadier general in command of the 2nd, the Sixth and Ninth Texas, a company of the 42nd Alabama and a portion of the 35th Mississippi, is ordered to make a frontal attack on Battery Robinette, while other units will attack all along the line at 10am.
Colonel Rogers knows what he's facing, so he puts on an armored vest and pins a short note on his clothing, giving his name, age, rank, command, and the address of friends.
Confederate advance
Rogers' command begins taking galling artillery fire even before they line up to attack.
They hug the earth and wait for Van Dorn's 10am signal.
The attack does not go off as planned.
General Hebert's division never gets into the fight, as he reports sick and his next in command, suddenly finding himself in command of a division, takes no action.
Only Maury's division gets into the fight on time, and the gallant Rogers lines up his men in a woods west of his assignment, Battery Robinette.
Captain Oscar Jackson of the 63rd Ohio describes what he saw – "In my campaigning I had never seen anything so hard to stand as that slow, steady tramp of Rogers and his men.
They made not a sound but looked as if they intended to walk right over us.
I afterwards took a bayonet charge when the enemy came on us at the double quick but it was not so trying on the nerves as that steady, solemn advance, with the man leading them astride a sleek black stallion."
Full Union attention now fell on Rogers and his men, and fire is concentrated on them.
They hack and scramble their way through the abatis while shrapnel explodes over their heads.
Once through the abatis, they reform while Battery Robinette switched from shells to grape shot and canister, cutting huge swaths in the advancing Southerners.
One Confederate later wrote home to his father – "We advanced through open hilly ground from which there was no protection.
It was as if hell had been let loose, shells bursting all around, round shot plowing the ground and canister sweeping the ground by the bushel.
It is a miracle how anyone escaped."
But most did and soon they were in rifle range, and the Springfields of the 47th Illinois open up.
The siege guns switch to bags of buckshot and fire into the coming Rebels.
death of William Rogers
Again Oscar Jackson reports what he saw – "The column was in full view and only about thirty yards distant ... boys, give them a volley.
As the smoke cleared away, there was apparently ten yards square of a mass of struggling bodies in butternut clothes.
Their column reeled like a rope shaken at the end.
Still, they deployed their columns and gave us a volley, but fired too low.
We gave them another volley and they broke back in confusion."
The Southerners are forced to fall back.
One of their many casualties was Halbert Rogers, son of the Colonel, who is carried off in a blanket.
Oscar Jackson goes on – "When I saw the enemy fall back I remarked that we would not have to fight these men again this day as I thought it would be impossible, but strange to say, just forty minutes later here they came again with that slow steady step and that gallant officer still astride his black steed.
Then they came at us with a yell on the double quick.
They dashed themselves against us like water on a rock and were again repulsed and driven back."
At this point the colors of the second Texas fall to the ground as the fourth colorbearer of the day goes down.
This time Rogers himself scoops up the flag and gallops back to his men.
He waves the standard and asks who will return to the fight, who will follow him.
Amazingly, the Southerners give a shout of approval and reform their ranks.
Who wouldn't follow Colonel William Rogers?
Rogers holds the colors aloft, keeping his horse at a slow pace so as to not outdistance his men.
Soon, they reach the ditch in front of Battery Robinette.
Rogers jumps his horse over the ditch, dismounts, scrambles up the side of the battery and plants the colors upon the fort.
The Rebels yell and follow Rogers into the fort, scattering the defenders.
Robinette is theirs!
where William Rogers fell
The Texans, Alabamians, and Mississippians are jubilant, but alas their jubilation is short lived.
They look up to see an ocean of blue advancing upon them.
It's the 63rd Ohio, the 43rd Ohio, and the 11th Missouri launching a counterattack.
They may have been driven off by the irresistible charge of Rogers and his men but that does not mean they are beaten.
William Rogers knows he is beaten; so he pulls a white handkerchief from his pocket and waves surrender.
But some of the Southerners do not see his sign of surrender and begin firing at the attacking Unionists, sparking return fire from the men in blue, who return a fierce volley.
Eleven bullets hit Colonel William Rogers and he falls to the ground dead.
No doubt, if he knew he was destined to die in battle, he would have preferred to die on this spot.
In essence, the Battle of Corinth was a fight between an aggressive commander who believed a frontal attack by the right troops at the right spot in the line would bring victory, as opposed to a cautious commander who believed careful planning for the employment of well equipped, rested troops would win any battle.
The aggressive commander this day, Earl Van Dorn, was wrong, and the cautious commander, William Starke Rosecrans, was right.
But October 4th, 1862 did not belong to either of these men.
From that day until this day, when the Battle of Corinth is the topic of discussion, one name stands out – William Peleg Rogers.
Both friend and foe were effusive in their praise.
One Northern correspondent reported – "It is the concurrent testimony of all who witnessed it that the charge made by the head of the rebel column on our breastworks, on Saturday had no parallel in this war for intrepid, obstinate courage and none to equal it in history.
The Second Texas Infantry, under Colonel Rogers, lead[sic] the charge, and the Colonel himself fell on our breastworks, with the colors of his regiment in his hand.
After the battle, but four of his Regiment was[sic] left alive and three of these were wounded and taken prisoner."
William Rosecrans inspects the field at battle's end, discovers the body of William Rogers, and asks his men to uncover the face so he can see it.
"He was one of the bravest men who ever led a charge.
Bury him with military honors and mark his grave to be sure he will be found."
Rogers' gravesite
Van Dorn was lavish in his praise – "I cannot refrain, however from mentioning here the conspicuous gallantry of a noble Texan, whose deeds at Corinth are the constant theme of both friend and foe.
As long as courage, manliness, fortitude, patriotism, and honor exist, the name of Rogers will be revered and honored among men."
The American Civil War would grind on for two-and-a-half more years before we stopped killing each other.
No one man could have reversed the result of the war, but we cannot help but wonder, had Rogers lived, what further glory he would have attained.
Many men who made their mark during the Civil War continued doing great things when they returned to civilian life.
Had Rogers decided against a third charge at Battery Robinette, he might well have been one of those classic citizen soldiers.
Second Battle of Corinth
October 3-4, 1862
After the Battle of Iuka, Maj. Gen. Sterling Price’s Confederate Army of the West marched from Baldwyn to Ripley where it joined Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn’s Army of West Tennessee.
Van Dorn was senior officer and took command of the combined force numbering about 22,000 men.
The Rebels marched to Pocahontas on October 1, and then moved southeast toward Corinth.
They hoped to seize Corinth and then sweep into Middle Tennessee.
Since the Siege of Corinth, in the spring, Union forces had erected various fortifications, an inner and intermediate line, to protect Corinth, an important transportation center.
With the Confederate approach, the Federals, numbering about 23,000, occupied the outer line of fortifications and placed men in front of them.
Van Dorn arrived within three miles of Corinth at 10:00 am on October 3, and moved into some fieldworks that the Confederates had erected for the siege of Corinth.
The fighting began, and the Confederates steadily pushed the Yankees rearward.
A gap occurred between two Union brigades which the Confederates exploited around 1:00 pm.
The Union troops moved back in a futile effort to close the gap.
Price then attacked and drove the Federals back further to their inner line.
By evening, Van Dorn was sure that he could finish the Federals off during the next day.
This confidence--combined with the heat, fatigue, and water shortages--persuaded him to cancel any further operations that day.
Rosecrans regrouped his men in the fortifications to be ready for the attack to come the next morning.
Van Dorn had planned to attack at daybreak, but Brig. Gen. Louis Hébert’s sickness postponed it till 9:00 am.
As the Confederates moved forward, Union artillery swept the field causing heavy casualties, but the Rebels continued on.
They stormed Battery Powell and closed on Battery Robinett, where desperate hand-to-hand fighting ensued.
A few Rebels fought their way into Corinth, but the Federals quickly drove them out.
The Federals continued on, recapturing Battery Powell, and forcing Van Dorn into a general retreat.
Rosecrans postponed any pursuit until the next day.
As a result, Van Dorn was defeated, but not destroyed or captured, at Hatchie Bridge, Tennessee, on October 5.

October 5 in Texas History….

Janis Joplin dies
On this day in 1970, rock singer Janis Joplin died of an accidental overdose of heroin and alcohol.
The twenty-seven-year-old native of Port Arthur had embraced the hippie counterculture at the University of Texas at Austin.
She developed her musical skills at Kenneth Threadgill's club and other Austin venues.
Joplin's four years of meteoric fame began when she joined Big Brother and the Holding Company in California in May 1966.
Her bluesy rendering of such songs as Willie Mae Thornton's "Ball and Chain" made her a national star, but her self-destructive manner of living led to her early death.
….
.
Another chapter in Texas History
JANIS LYN JOPLIN (1943–1970).
Janis Lyn Joplin, blues and rock singer, daughter of Seth Ward and Dorothy (East) Joplin, was born on January 19, 1943, in Port Arthur, Texas.
She grew up in a respectable middle-class home; her father was an engineer and her mother a Sunday school teacher.
The future queen of nonconformity is remembered as a bright, pretty, and artistic little girl.
Signs of rebellion, however, against the religious, sexual, and racial conservatism of her environment were evident in junior high school, and by the time Janis graduated from Jefferson High School in Port Arthur in 1960, her vocabulary of four letter words, her outrageous clothes, and her reputation for sexual promiscuity and drunkenness (signs of alcoholism were already apparent) caused her classmates to call her derogatory names.
Bereft of friends, without dates for school dances, ashamed of her acned face and overweight figure, Janis responded with contempt and insults to cover the rejection that scarred her for the rest of her life.
In her junior year she found acceptance in a small group of Jefferson High beatniks who read Jack Kerouac and roamed the nightspots from Port Arthur to New Orleans, thus mining one of the motherlodes of American ethnic music.
There were Anglo, African American, Cajun, Mexican, and Caribbean sounds.
There were the lyrics and rhythms of country, gospel, jazz, soul, and the blues.
Janis did not read music, but at the roadhouses or at home listening to records of Odetta, Bessie Smith, or Willie Mae Thornton, she had an uncanny ability to imitate the sounds she heard.
Out of imitation there slowly developed the timing, phrasing, inflections, and talent at evoking changing moods that were the Joplin trademarks.
She found Lamar State College of Technology at Beaumont no improvement over Port Arthur; she was a rebel and a "nigger lover" in both places.
She fled to the University of Texas in Austin in the summer of 1962 to study art.
Indifferent to classwork, she found soulmates at the Ghetto, a counterculture enclave, and got gigs around Austin, most importantly at Threadgill's, a converted filling station and late night hangout for lovers of music and nonstop partying.
The proprietor, country singer Kenneth Threadgill, offered Janis encouragement and lifelong friendship.
Janis craved such acceptance, but her nonconforming behavior often provoked rejection, as when university fraternity pranksters nominated her as their candidate in the annual Ugliest Man on Campus contest.
Characteristically, she laughed to cover the hurt, and dreamed of San Francisco, where Beats and Hippies were not outsiders.
She spent 1963 to 1965 in the Bay area and won attention from local audiences, until drugs became more important than singing and reduced her to an emaciated eighty-eight pounds.
Her friends passed the hat and gave her a bus ticket home.
Parental care restored her health, and fear of relapse produced a period of sobriety.
Business suits and bouffant hairdos announced conversion to the Port Arthur ethos.
But Janis's mind was torn: Port Arthur was safe but dull.
San Francisco offered both excitement and potential self destruction.
She made her decision after receiving an offer to audition for a new rock band, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and headed west in May 1966, toward four years of meteoric fame—and death at age twenty-seven.
"Imagine a white girl singing the blues like that!"
they said of Big Brother's lead singer.
And Joplin's belting of rock gathered huge swaying, clapping, shouting, and dancing audiences.
For Janis a good audience was an audience in motion, and her body joined her voice in pleading for audience participation.
She stopped the show at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 with "Ball and Chain."
That triumph and the album Cheap Thrills (1968) elevated her to national stardom.
A new manager, Albert Grossman, whose stable of stars included Peter, Paul and Mary and Bob Dylan, urged Janis to dump Big Brother for more versatile and disciplined support.
The Kosmic Blues band was never satisfactory; the Full Tilt Boogie band was.
Joplin's career now surged forward full tilt, driven by Southern Comfort booze, heroin, bisexual liaisons, compulsive work, and the hope that fame would bring inner peace.
Success now meant concerts in Madison Square Garden, Paris, London, Woodstock, and Harvard Stadium; adulation in the New York Times; a guest appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show; and a six-figure salary.
Janis was ready in August 1970 to confront the Jefferson High classmates who had called her a slut.
Whether her primary purpose in attending the tenth-anniversary class reunion was revenge, a desire to be worshiped as a hero, or just a quest for acceptance is unclear.
What is certain is that she left Port Arthur feeling further alienated from her classmates, her parents, and her hometown.
When she died in Los Angeles two months later, on October 4, 1970, of an accidental overdose of heroin and alcohol, her newly drawn will required that her ashes be strewn over California soil.
The judgment of others has been far kinder to Janis Joplin than she was to herself.
She has been called "the best white blues singer in American musical history" and "the greatest female singer in the history of rock 'n' roll."
Those who missed her live performances must judge her from a relatively small number of albums, audiotapes, and videotapes.
Pearl, an album recorded just before her death and featuring "Me and Bobby McGee," shows that Janis was growing musically almost to the moment of her death.
The film The Rose (1979), starring Bette Midler, is not faithful in detail to Janis's life, but it captures her mesmerizing power onstage, in contrast to her utter powerlessness offstage to halt her relentless descent to self destruction.
Janis's sad life cannot be separated from her greatness.
Her tortured soul gave her blues the authenticity of direct experience.
After her death she was finally accepted in the hometown she both loved and ridiculed.
In 1988 some 5,000 people from Port Arthur, tears in their eyes, sang "Me and Bobby McGee" as a bust of Janis Joplin was unveiled.
It now sits in a Port Arthur library.
In the 2000s Port Arthur's Museum of the Gulf Coast featured Joplin among its exhibits and she was an inductee in the Gulf Coast Music Hall of Fame.
Port Arthur holds a birthday bash every January in celebration of the singer.
In the decades after her death, various Joplin anthologies and live recordings were released as well as numerous biographies.
In 1992 her sister, Laura Joplin, published Love, Janis, a collection of letters Janis wrote to her family beginning in 1963.
A play with the same title and based on the book opened in Denver in 1995 and subsequently had a long run at the Zachary Scott Theater in Austin in summer 1997.
The performance opened off Broadway in April 2001 and ran to January 5, 2003.
Janis Joplin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on January 12, 1995.
In 2005 she was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
A Texas State Historical Marker was erected in front of Joplin’s childhood home in Port Arthur in January 2008 in commemoration of the singer’s sixty-fifth birthday.
She was inducted into the Austin Music Memorial in 2010.
October 5, 1970
Janis Joplin Dies; Rock Star Was 27
By REUTERS
HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 4 -- Janis Joplin, the rock singer, was found dead in her Hollywood apartment tonight.
She was 27 years old.
The cause of death was not immediately determined, but the police said she apparently died of an overdose of drugs.
They said she had been dead for about two hours when she was found shortly after 10 P.M.
Miss Joplin was the second noted pop singer to die in less than three weeks.
Jimi Hendrix, 27, died in London Sept. 18 after taking nine strong sleeping tablets.
She would stand before her audience, microphone in hand, long red hair flailing, her raspy voice shrieking in rock mutations of black country blues.
Pellets of sweat flew from her contorted face and glittered in the beam of footlights.
Janis Joplin sang with more than her voice.
Her involvement was total.
She lived that way, too.
The girl from Port Arthur, Tex., who moved to stardom by way of the San Francisco rock upsurge, talked openly of the Southern Comfort she drank and of the joys of being inebriated.
With the same abandon that she sang, she drove her Porsche through the hills of San Francisco, a fast looking car, decorated with psychedelic butterflies.
"When I get scared and worried," she said at the time, "I tell myself, 'Janis, just have a good time.'
So I juice up real good and that's just what I have."
By the time she was riding the crest of rock popularity, having soared into prominence with her rendition of "Love is Like a Ball and Chain" and the 1967 Monterey Rock Festival.
The song, said one critic, "was wrenched out of some deep dark nether region of her Texas soul."
Back home in Port Arthur she had been a misfit.
"I read, I painted, I didn't hate niggers," she once recalled.
"Man, those people back home hurt me.
It make me happy to know I'm making it and they're back there, plumbers just like they were."
She tried college several times, and a job as a computer programmer.
She collected Leadbelly and Bessie Smith records, but she never really sang professionally until June of 1966.
An old friend, Travis Rivers, had formed a band in San Francisco called Big Brother and the Holding Company.
He sent for her and once again she left Port Arthur, this time for the Haight Ashbury section of San Francisco.
It was June of that year and the band was playing the Avalon, a ballroom.
She had just arrived and the ambiance of the flailing, gyrating, burgeoning "youth scene" of San Francisco was heady.
"I couldn't believe it, all that rhythm and power," she said.
"I got stoned just feeling it, like it was the best dope in the world.
It was so sensual, so vibrant, loud, crazy.
I couldn't stay still; I had never danced when I sang, but there I was moving and jumping.
I couldn't hear myself, so I sang louder and louder.
By the end I was wild ..."
There followed performances at the Psychedelic Supermarket in Boston, the Kinetic Playground in Chicago, the Whisky A-Go-Go in Los Angeles and the Fillmore East in New York.
There was Cheap Thrills, the album that sold more than a million copies.
And there was Miss Joplin screaming, "Take another piece of my heart, baby."
There were big money and rock festivals.
And the tempo of her private life kept pace with the driving songs.
The Southern Comfort distillery gave her a fur coat in recognition of the publicity she gave the company by drinking from a bottle at her concerts.
Her home in San Francisco was decorated in Rococo bordello style.
She shared it with dog named George and a Siamese fighting fish named Charley whose aquarium was a wine bottle.
Her behavior was explosive.
In November, 1969, she was arrested after a concert in Tampa, Fla., for screaming obscenities at a policeman in the audience.
She was temperamental and demanded the same dedication of her backup musicians as she herself gave.
She split from the Holding Company and formed her own band, the Janis Joplin Full Tilt Boogie Band.
And there were those who said that neither her voice nor her health could stand the demands she made upon them, on stage and off.
Her answer: "Maybe I won't last as long as other singers, but I think you can destroy your now worrying about tomorrow."
Last interview before her death
Howard Smith: We were supposed to do an interview, do you remember, you know, a long time ago.
And some article putting you down in Rolling Stone had just come out.
Janis Joplin: Yeah
Howard Smith: And you got very upset about that.
Are you still that upset when you are put down in any articles?
Janis Joplin: You know I should be able to get past that, you know.
But I mean girls want to be reassured.
Which is not to say that all people don’t.
But I think women especially … I mean even though I know that those are just assholes that don’t know what they’re talking about and I should just continue with my music, you know.
And let them either come into the show and listen, or go home and beat off.
I don’t care what they do.
I should be able to beat through that.
But in my insides, it really hurts if someone doesn’t like me.
You know, it’s silly.
[laughs]
Howard Smith: Because I remember that time you were very upset.
Janis Joplin: Well that was a pretty heavy time for me.
It was really important, you know, whether people were going to accept me or not.
Howard Smith: A lot of women have been saying that the whole field of rock music is nothing more than just a big, male, chauvinist rip-off.
How do you.
.
Janis Joplin: [laughs] Yeah?
Howard Smith: Yeah.
And when I say: “well what about Janis Joplin, she made it?”
And they say: “oh, her.”
And it seems to bother a lot of women’s lib people that you’re kind of so upfront sexually.
Janis Joplin: Well then that’s their problem.
Not mine.I haven’t ever hardly talked with anyone in women’s lib.
I haven’t been attacked by anyone yet.
How can they attack me?
I’m representing everything they said they want.
You know what i mean?
Well I have an opinion about this.
It’s sort of like: you are what you settle for.
Do you know what I mean?
You’re only as much as you settle for.
If they settle for being somebody’s dishwasher that’s their own fucking problem.
If you don’t settle for that and you keep fighting it, you know, you’ll end up anything you want to be.
How can they attack me?
I’m just doing what I wanted to and what feels right and not settling for bullshit and it worked.
How can they be mad at that?
Howard Smith: One girl I know said: well how come she doesn’t have any women in any of her groups?
Janis Joplin: [Laughs] You show me a good drummer and I’ll hire one.
Show me a good chick…
Besides I don’t want any chicks on the road with me.
Howard Smith: You don’t?
Janis Joplin: I’ve got enough competition, man.
[Laughs] No, I like to be around men.
[Laughs]
Janis_Joplin_Like_Men_SHORT
Janis Joplin: Did all that shit I said about chicks sound bad?
Howard Smith: No, you said what you wanted to say.
Don’t be silly.
Janis Joplin: Well I don’t want to offend people.
It’s just that like, you know, I have a certain set of circumstances I live under.
Like you know all this repressive upbringing and things.
I had that, too.
You don’t think I had a repressive upbringing in Port Arthur, Texas?
It’s just that it drove me crazy and I kept fighting against it.
I don’t think you can talk anybody into fighting against it.
If they don’t have it in themselves to need more.
You know what I mean?
Just plain need more.
Then that’s that.
If they do need more, they’ll get more.
They’ll demand more.
You know what i mean?

Janis Joplin: Her Final Hours
Janis Joplin had been clean for six months when she died of a heroin overdose in 1970.
What went wrong?
On October 4, 1970 Janis Joplin's Road Manager John Cooke went to the Landmark Hotel (now the Highland Gardens Hotel) in Los Angeles to see why she hadn't shown up at the Sunset Sound Studio.
She was recording her latest album Pearl with her new band Full Tilt Boogie.
Cooke and producer Paul Rothchild were concerned because Janis was never late for her recording sessions.
Yet no one had seen or heard from her in almost 24 hours, not since she had left the studio and went drinking with the band.
Upon entering the room Cooke found Janis, her body cold and lifeless, lying on the floor of her hotel room.
He knew as he approached that she was dead.
As a massive blast of heroin had hit her brain her body had begun to convulse violently.
John Cooke found her where she had fallen, crumpled like a rag doll, her body wedged in the space between the bed and the nightstand.
She was partially undressed and the paraphernalia she had used to shoot up was lying out on a table.
Janis had partied with the band and then left the bar alone, heading back to her room at the Landmark.
It is assumed that she overdosed shortly after her arrival back at the hotel.
Questions surrounding the death of Janis Joplin have continued for years.
At the time of her death Janis had recently become engaged to Seth Morgan, she was working with her new band, Full Tilt Boogie, and she was excited about the future.
She was talking about leaving the music business, settling down, possibly raising a family.
More importantly, she had finally kicked the heroin addiction that had plagued her for years.
She had been clean for six months when she went into the studio in Hollywood to begin recording what would become her last, and greatest work, the album Pearl.
So how is it that, at a time when she seemed to have so much to live for, Janis Joplin was found dead on the floor of her hotel room from a massive heroin overdose?
She had been dead for 18 hours when her body was discovered.
She had been alone when she died.
Janis Joplin - Final 24: Her Final Hours, one of the four Final 24 DVDs released byMVD Visual Entertainment, recreates the last 24 hours in the life of Janis Joplin, the first female rock star.
It traces her movements: who she met with, who she spoke to on the phone, where she went.
The hour long film tells the story of her rise to the top of the '60s music scene and her descent into alcohol and heroin addiction.
Her brother Michael Joplin speaks, adding his insight into her childhood and her relationship with her parents, particularly the difficult relationship with her mother.
Interviews with High School and College friends Jim Langdon and Powell St. John unravel her pre-stardom years--the years that seemed to have doomed her.
They talk about the abuse and humiliation she suffered as an outcast in her birth town of Port Arthur, Texas and at the University of Texas in Austin.
Through archival concert and television footage (including her legendary appearances on The Dick Cavett Show) and realistic re-enactments, we are introduced to the woman behind the rock star.
The small town girl who would come to be known as 'The Wild Woman of Rock' and finally, simply, Pearl.
We catch a glimpse of what those who knew her saw: a little girl, tough on the outside, yet broken inside, afraid to be alone.
Her former road manager John Cooke, publicist Myra Friedman, and members of Big Brother and Full Tilt Boogie, David Getz, Sam Andrew and John Till, tell the story of Janis's three years as a rock and roll icon.
From Big Brother's soul-shaking debut performance at The Monterey Pop Festival in 1967--the performance that threw Janis into the whirlwind of rock stardom--through her misery in Kozmic Blues Band and finally, her recovery from addiction and her excitement in joining Full Tilt Boogie and recording Pearl.
It covers the most compelling mystery of all.
How could Janis Joplin have overdosed on heroin?
By all accounts, including Full Tilt Boogie Band members working and hanging out with her literally hours before her death, she was clean.
Where had she gotten the heroin?
Who was the last person to speak with her on the night she died?
Final 24 is a series of true life stories, each of which documents the life and death of a famous person.
By examining the past, and re-creating the events that occurred on the day they died, Producer Nick Godwin is able to capture, through reflection, the tragic end that was always rushing towards them like a head-on train.
Some died by accident, others through self-destruction or suicide, and some had their lives cut short by the hand of another.
Released by MVD Entertainment Group, Final 24, part documentary and part biography, is a fascinating collection of real life, and death, stories.
Heart-wrenching.
Tragic.
Brilliant.
Nick Godwin is a genius.
I give Janis Joplin: Her Final Hours my highest recommendation for those who love 60's and 70's rock, and for her fans, of course.
That says a lot coming from me--a girl with an extensive background in rock history.
It's rare for me to hear a Joplin story that I haven't heard before.
What I liked most about this video is that it wasn't the same old re-hashed stories, it was personal, people talking about a girl they knew.
A girl they loved.
I've had a Dead Crush on Janis Joplin for years.
I've read the biographies, listened to the music, watched the interviews, but this is the first time I've seen the puzzle pieces of her life put together in such a way.
Listening to her friends and family talk about her life, and seeing the impact her death had on them, has brought me that much closer to understanding this complicated woman.
Sadly, what is revealed in hindsight might well have saved her life, but I think Jim Langdon put it best in the video: "She's still with us.
37 years later, no matter where you are in America, you can flip on your car radio and, at some point or another, you're going to hear Janis Joplin... singing."
Music Trivia:
At the time that Janis Joplin died of a massive overdose, eight other people also died from overdoses in LA--all from the same batch of heroin that had killed her.
Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin both found instant rock stardom at The Monterey Pop Festival.
They died within weeks of one another, Hendrix on September 18, 1970, Joplin on October 4, 1970.
They were both 27 years old.

Alamo survivor dies
On this day in 1883, Susanna Wilkerson Dickinson, survivor of the Alamo, died in Austin.
The Tennessee native married Almaron Dickinson in 1829 and moved to Gonzales, Texas, in 1831.
Susanna's only child, Angelina Elizabeth Dickinson, was born in 1834.
Her husband went off to serve in the Texas Revolution in October 1835.
She joined him in San Antonio, probably in December, and lodged in Ramón Músquiz's home, where she opened her table to boarders (among them David Crockett).
On February 23, 1836, the family moved into the Alamo.
After the battle of the Alamo on March 6, Mexican soldiers found her--some accounts say in the powder magazine, others in the church--and took her and Angelina, along with the other women and children, to Músquiz's home.
The women were later interviewed by Santa Anna, who gave each a blanket and two dollars in silver before releasing them.
Legend says Susanna displayed her husband's Masonic apron to a Mexican general in a plea for help and that Santa Anna offered to take Angelina to Mexico.
Santa Anna sent Susanna and her daughter, accompanied by Juan N. Almonte's servant Ben, to Sam Houston with a letter of warning dated March 7.
On the way, the pair met Joe, William B. Travis's slave, who had been freed by Santa Anna.
The party was discovered by Erastus (Deaf) Smith and Henry Wax Karnes.
Smith guided them to Houston in Gonzales.
After the tragic events at the Alamo, Susanna lived a long and troubled life, marrying five times and sometimes making a living as a prostitute before achieving a measure of stability and prosperity with her last husband, Joseph William Hannig.

Another chapter in Texas History
SUSANNA WILKERSON DICKINSON (ca. 1814–1883).
Susanna Wilkerson Dickinson (Dickenson), survivor of the Alamo, was born about 1814 in Tennessee, perhaps in Williamson County.
Her first name has also been recorded as Susan, Susana, and Suzanna; her maiden name is sometimes given as Wilkinson.
On May 24, 1829, she married Almeron Dickinson before a justice of the peace in Bolivar, Hardeman County, Tennessee.
The couple remained in the vicinity through the end of 1830.
The Dickinsons arrived at Gonzales, Texas, on February 20, 1831, in company with fifty-four other settlers, after a trip by schooner from New Orleans.
On May 5 Dickinson received a league of land from Green DeWitt, on the San Marcos River in what became Caldwell County.
He received ten more lots in and around Gonzales in 1833 and 1834.
The Dickinsons lived on a lot just above the town on the San Marcos River, where Susanna took in at least one boarder.
A map of Gonzales in 1836 shows a Dickinson and Kimble hat factory in Gonzales.
Susanna's only child, Angelina Elizabeth Dickinson, was born on December 14, 1834.
Susanna and her daughter may have joined other families hiding in the timber along the Guadalupe River in early October 1835, when Mexican troops from San Antonio demanded the return of an old cannon lent to Gonzales four years earlier.
The resulting skirmish, the battle of Gonzales, was the first fight of the Texas Revolution.
Susanna said goodbye to her husband on October 13 as the volunteers left for San Antonio under command of Stephen F. Austin.
She remained in Gonzales through November, when newly arriving troops looted her home.
She joined Dickinson in San Antonio, probably in December 1835, and lodged in Ramón Músquiz's home, where she opened her table to boarders (among them David Crockettqv) and did laundry.
On February 23, 1836, the family moved into the Alamo.
After the battle of the Alamo on March 6, Mexican soldiers found her-some accounts say in the powder magazine, others in the church-and took her and Angelina, along with the other women and children, to Músquiz's home.
The women were later interviewed by Santa Anna, who gave each a blanket and two dollars in silver before releasing them.
Legend says Susanna displayed her husband's Masonic apron to a Mexican general in a plea for help and that Santa Anna offered to take Angelina to Mexico.
Santa Anna sent Susanna and her daughter, accompanied by Juan N. Almonte's servant Ben, to Sam Houston with a letter of warning dated March 7.
On the way, the pair met Joe, William B. Travis's slave, who had been freed by Santa Anna.
The party was discovered by Erastus (Deaf) Smith and Henry Wax Karnes.qqv Smith guided them to Houston in Gonzales, where they arrived after dark about March 12.
Susanna Dickinson probably followed the army eastward in company with the other Gonzales women.
Illiterate, without family, and only twenty-two years old, she petitioned the government meeting at Columbia in October 1836 for a donation, but the proposed $500 was not awarded.
She needed a male protector, and by June 1837 she was cohabiting with John Williams, whom she married about November 27, 1837.
He beat her and Angelina, and she petitioned in Harrisburg (later Harris) County for a divorce, which was granted on March 24, 1838-one of the first divorces in the county.
By 1839 Almeron Dickinson's heirs had received rights to 2,560 acres for his military service; they sold the land when Angelina reached twenty-one.
Subsequent requests to the state legislature in November 1849 were turned down.
Susanna tried matrimony three more times before settling into a stable relationship.
She wed Francis P. Herring on December 20, 1838, in Houston.
Herring, formerly from Georgia, had come to Texas after October 20, 1837.
He died on September 15, 1843.
On December 15, 1847, Susanna married Pennsylvania drayman Peter Bellows (also known as Bellis or Belles) before an Episcopalian minister.
In 1850 the couple had sixteen-year-old Angelina living with them.
But by 1854 Susanna had left Bellows, who charged her with adultery and prostitution when he filed for divorce in 1857.
Susanna may have lived in the Mansion House Hotel of Pamelia Mann, which was known as a brothel, before marrying Bellows.
The divorce petition accuses her of taking up residence in a "house of ill fame."
Nevertheless, Susanna received praise from the Baptist minister Rufus C. Burleson for her work nursing cholera victims in Houston, where he baptized her in Buffalo Bayou in 1849.
Susanna's fifth marriage was long-lasting.
She married Joseph William Hannig (or Hannag), a native of Germany living in Lockhart, in 1857.
They soon moved to Austin, where Hannig became prosperous with a cabinet shop and later a furniture store and undertaking parlor; he also owned a store in San Antonio.
Susanna became ill in February 1883 and died on October 7 of that year.
Hannig buried her in Oakwood Cemetery, and even though he married again, he was buried next to Susanna after his death in 1890.
Angelina Elizabeth Dickinson
Little is known of the early life of Susannah Wilkerson Dickinson of Bolivar, HardemanCo, TN before she married at age 15 DeWitt Colonist, member of the Old Gonzales 18 and Alamo Defender Almeron Dickinson on 24 May 1829 with Justice of the Peace Joseph W. McKean officiating.
According to family legend, Almeron and Susannah were sweethearts, but a spat caused Almeron to court a friend of both.
Susannah was to be a bridesmaid at Almeron's wedding to the friend, but somehow her charms persuaded Almeron to marry her instead and after which they migrated to Texas.
Present in the Alamo garrison during the siege and Battle of the Alamo in which Almeron was a casualty, Susannah Dickinson's life was spared by General and President Santa Anna and consequently she became the most extensively quoted eyewitness source to the final and subsequent events surrounding the Alamo defeat of 6 Mar 1836 in San Antonio.
She was first found by English-speaking General Juan Almonte who asked for her and said "If you wish to save your life, follow me."
Susannah was injured in the leg or ankle by a bullet, either stray or intentional, as she was escorted from her hiding place in the chapel.
Almeron and Susannah Dickinson's 15 month old daughter Angelina Elizabeth (1834-1871) was also present and a survivor of the defeat.
According to Susannah, when she was escorted into Santa Anna's quarters, she found Angelina sitting on the lap of the dictator.
He offered to adopt her and provide the best education and support for her in Mexico.
After refusal of the offer, Susannah was released and sent to Gonzales by Santa Anna escorted by one or more Negro servants with a letter dated 7 Mar 1836:
The General-in-Chief of the Army of Operations of the Mexican Republic, to the inhabitants of Texas:
Citizens!
The causes which have conducted to this frontier a part of the Mexican Army are not unknown to you, a parcel of audacious adventurers, maliciously protected by some inhabitants of a neighboring republic dared to invade our territory, with the intention of dividing amongst themselves the fertile lands that are contained in the spacious Depart ment of Texas; and even had the boldness to entertain the idea of reaching the capital of the republic.
It became necessary to check and chastise such enormous daring; and in consequence, some exemplary punishments have already taken place in San Patricio, Lipantitlan and this city.
I am pained to find amongst those adventurers the names of some colonists, to whom had been granted repeated benefits, and who had no motive of complaint against the government of their adopted country.
These ungrateful men must also necessarily suffer the just punishment that the laws and the public vengeance demand.
But if we are bound to punish the criminal, we are not the less compelled to protect the innocent.
It is thus that the inhabitants of this country, let their origin be what it may, who should not appear to have been implicated in such iniquitous rebellion, shall be respected in their persons and property, provided they come forward and report themselves to the commander of the troops within eight days after they should have arrived in their respective settlements, in order to justify their conduct and to receive a document guaranteeing to them the right of enjoying that which lawfully belongs to them.
Bexarians!
Return to your homes and dedicate yourselves to your domestic duties.
Your city and the fortress of the Alamo are already in possession of the Mexican Army, composed of your own fellow citizens; and rest assured that no mass of foreigners will ever interrupt your repose, and much less, attack your lives and plunder your property.
The Supreme Government has taken you under its protection and will seek for your good.
Inhabitants of Texas!
I have related to you the orders that the army of operation I have the honor to command comes to execute; and therefore, the good will have nothing to fear.
Fulfill always your duties as Mexican citizens, and you may expect the protection and benefit of the laws; and rest assured that you will never have reason to repent yourselves of having observed such conduct, for I pledge you in the name of the supreme authorities of the nation, and as your fellow citizen and friend, that what has been promised you will be faithfully performed.
Antonio Lopes de Santa Anna.
Mrs. Dickinson, Angelina and the blacks eventually made their way toward Gonzales where they were met by Texian army scouts who took her to the camp of Gen. Houston and army assembling in Gonzales town proper where she reported the news of the disaster and Santa Anna's messages.
Susannah is said to have been present at the Braches House where many Alamo widows and orphans had gathered as Gonzales prepared to evauate on the Runaway Scrape.
It is said that the widows and orphans insistently pressed her for some last word, maybe a last note or message from their husbands, fathers and brothers.
According to members of the Bruno family who had first encountered Ms. Dickinson and party on the way to Gonzales from the Alamo, Susannah and Angelina accompanied them on the flight by oxcart on the Runaway Scrape to East Texas and the Sabine River where they remained until after San Jacinto and establishment of the Republic of Texas.
In Houston in fall 1836, widow Susannah Dickinson appeared among the many widows and veterans applying to the Congress of the Republic for aid, backpay and bounty land.
Her appeal was denied based on the argument that the young Republic had limited means and payment to her would open up appeals to many families of deceased veterans beyond means of the Republic to pay.
Records indicate a troubled marriage with a John Williams (1837) in Houston which ended in divorce granted to Susannah 24 Mar 1838.
The divorce was granted on the basis of allegations by Susannah that Williams had failed to provide support for her and Angelina, while exercising physical force sufficient to have caused an abortion and the beating and abuse of Angelina.
Legend says that Susannah was aided by and lived in the rowdy Mansion House at the corner of Congress and Milam streets run by Pamelia/Pamela Mann sometime between 1838 and 1840.
The Mansion House was a gaudy, baudy, rowdy, hotel and restaurant and a center of much activity in the new capitol of the Republic.
The house was frequented both by those of questionable and high class reputation.
Mrs. Mann established her place in history as the matron who confronted Houston over return of her yoke of oxen which was pulling the "Twin Sisters" cannons as the army turned toward San Jacinto away from the road to Nacogdoches.
Mann was known for her ability to control brawls, duels and police raids on her establishment.
She was periodically charged with counterfeiting, immorality, larceny and assualt.
At one time she was even sentenced to death for forgery and other crimes, but received executive clemency from President Lamar.
Susannah is thought to have run her own boarding house not far from the Mansion House at Franklin and Crawford during the time when the capital of Texas was moved to Austin.
On 20 Dec 1838, Susannah Dickinson Williams married Francis P. Herring of Georgia, a water carrier working between Beauchamp Spring and Houston.
Herring died according to obituary of digestive fever, but some relatives said it was from excessive drinking.
On 15 Dec 1847, Susannah Dickinson Williams Herring married 37 year old Pennsylvanian and drayman, Peter Bellows (also spelled as Bellis and Bells in some records) who was listed together with Susannah, Angelina and a German boarder, R.E. Goodbaker, in the 1850 census of HarrisCo.
Susannah was converted in the massive Baptist revival campaign of Dr. Rufus Burleson in Houston in 1849 where he remarked in his Memoirs "she was nominally a member of the Episcopal Church...I found in her a great bundle of untamed passions, devoted in her love and bitter in her hate...she was joyfully converted.
In less than two months her change was so complete as to be observed by all her neighbors....she was a zealous co-laborer of mine in every good work...whenever she did wrong, especially in giving way to passion, she would confess and weep over it."
According to family histories, members of the church objected to having Susannah as a colleague and through gossip and possibly more overt harassment, she withdrew from membership of her own accord, although Rev. Burleson supported and defended her continued membership.
Family histories contend that Bellows was a poor husband and failed to support her and daughter Angelina based on evidence that she had to run her own boarding house to support herself and the child while married to him.
In 1857, husband Peter Bellows delivered a devastating petition for divorce to HarrisCo court accusing her of abandonment, "adulting with several persons," and claimed that Susannah took up residence in a "house of ill fame...as one of its inmates for accommodation of the public.
.
in constant habit of committing adultery with various persons."
Susannah who was apparently already living in Lockhart, CaldwellCo at the time of the proceedings failed to appear and the court judged the allegations true and granted the divorce.
Whether the allegations were true to the letter or the exaggeration of a punitive spouse is unclear.
In Lockhart east of the original land grant received by her and Almeron Dickinson as DeWitt Colonists, Susannah Dickinson Williams Herring Bellows life turned happy again for the first time since loss of her first husband Almeron Dickinson in the Alamo.
Exercising her skills as a hostess and cook, she again set up a boarding house to support herself.
How Susannah met her fifth and final spouse, German-born Joseph W. Hannig is unclear.
Some say they met in Houston, others New Orleans and others Lockhart.
Lockhart merchant and in-law E.A. Masur says "Hannig was a pioneer blacksmith, a man who really appreciated a good meal.
When he sampled Susannah's cabbage, bacon, and cornbread, he just up and married her."
In 1856 exercising the power of attorney given her by ex-husband Bellows and her daughter's family in 1854, she sold the Dickinson league near Lockhart to John S. McKean for $2500.
Susannah and Angelina were also awarded at one time 640 acres and another 1920 acres in ClayCo, TX as descendants of Almeron Dickinson in the Texas Republican Army.
With the assets from sale of the Dickinson league to begin on, the marriage to Hannig was a prosperous and happy one.
In 1862, Susannah Hannig met again the Rev. Dr. Rufus Burleson who together with Rev. W.W. Harris was holding a revival in Lockhart at the Baptist Church.
As the Rev. appealed for the converted, but backslidden "who had grown cold and wandered away, and now wanted to return to the path of duty" to come forward, among them was Susannah Hannig causing Burleson to remark later "...to my astonishment I saw the stalwart form moving up the aisle that I saw moving up the aisle in Houston in 1849."
As they shook hands, Susannah remarked to him "erring and wayward, but still struggling to do right and serve my Redeemer."
In Austin of the late 1800's where the family moved, Mr. Hannig was a major business innovator and developer involved in numerous and diverse business ventures.
Among these were furniture making, undertaking and milling in which he introduced new levels of quality in his products for the time and period.
He owned a shop at 205 Pecan St. Susannah was the center of family life at residences on Pine Street (now 5th St.) between Neches and Red River St. In the 1870's the family lived at Duval and East 32nd St. facing Waller Creek, described as living in comfortable circumstances.
Mr. E.A. Masur described his aunt as "a very dignified old lady and all who knew her respected her, and she was always ready to talk about her past experiences...[as a boy] I remember dreading being kissed by an old lady with hair on her upper lip."
Mr. Hannig by standards of the day was a wealthy man and good husband providing for Susannah comfortable circumstances the remainder of her life, including numerous servants, mostly young German girls who became her friends.
She was known to be the historic excellant cook of her youth and homemaker, she raised and educated her grandchildren in Catholic schools and convents, and was active in the church and social affairs around her.
In Austin circles, Susannah became somewhat a celebrity particularly among the circles in which her husband's activities in the community put her in contact.
She was very active in relating her experiences in the Alamo and commemorating its heroes whenever called on.
She was called on repeatedly to verify participation by various individuals in the siege in legal proceedings initiated by descendants, although husband Hannig disapproved of such extensive involvement in repeating tales of her past including the Alamo experience.
Susannah is suspected by historians of adapting her tales to the audience over the years, as memory of the original event faded and the story was told and reported constantly over the years through secondary sources.
She died in Austin on 7 Oct 1883.
Mr. Hannig lived in San Antonio until his death in 1890 where he continued his successful businesses and contributions to civic affairs which included a marriage to Louisa Staacke.
Hannig had a marble marker placed on wife Susannah's grave in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery stating: Sacred to the Memory of Susan A. Wife of J.W. Hannig Died Oct. 7, 1883 Aged 68 Years.
The Colorado Commandery of Knights Templar met Hannig's remains as they arrived from San Antonio and he was buried next to Susannah with a marker: My Husband Joseph W. Hannig born June 14, 1834; died June 6, 1890.
In the Centennial Year of 1936, state historical markers were placed around the state for its heroes, but none for Susannah Dickinson.
In-law E.A. Masur took up the crusade to mark her gravesite.
After many denials by the legislature, on 2 Mar 1949, the state placed a marble slab of white marble over the gravesite of Alamo Widow and Survivor Susannah Dickinson, too late for E.A. Masur to witness it for he died in 1948.
A cenotaph to Susannah Dickinson also stands in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.
Susanna Dickinson
by ANNE DINGUS
SHE BECAME AN INSTANT HEROINE by surviving the fall of the Alamo on March 6, 1836.
Susanna Dickinson was only 21 and the mother of a baby daughter when she sought shelter inside the walls of the mission-turned-fort, where her husband, Almeron, captained the artillery.
During the thirteen days of the siege, Susanna cooked for the defenders and cared for the wounded and sick; her eyewitness account of the battle’s aftermath remains a touchstone for Alamo historians.
Her husband’s last words, she recalled, were “Great God, Sue, the Mexicans are inside the walls!
All is lost!
If they spare you, save our child!”
Mexican soldiers found her huddled in the chapel and hauled her before General Santa Anna; he spared her life and the baby’s, then dispatched them to the Texas army in Gonzales with broadsides boasting of his military might.
Thus the Alamo did indeed have its messenger of defeat.
She was born Susanna Wilkerson in 1814 in Hardeman County, Tennessee.
Her exact birth date is unknown; so is the spelling of her first name.
Susanna was not the only survivor of the Alamo.
She and her daughter, Angelina, were the only Anglos who escaped the carnage, but one black man and several Mexican women and children also survived.
As she exited the Alamo, a bullet tore through her leg.
Because of that injury, Santa Anna supplied her with a horse to reach Gonzales.
Inevitably, historians embroidered Susanna’s tale.
For example, one claimed she gave birth during the siege.
Even John Wayne, in The Alamo  (1960), dispensed with the leg wound, providing actress Joan O’Brien (in high heels) with the ultimate dramatic exit.
After the war, Susanna moved to Houston and embarked on a series of ill-fated marriages.
One ended in widowhood, again, and two in divorce (a shocking rarity in those days).
Husband number four charged Susanna with adultery and “opening another kind of house.”
Indeed, she had once worked (perhaps, to give her the benefit of the doubt, as a laundress) at a Houston brothel.
Because of the scandal, some members of the First Baptist Church objected to her attendance there.
She voluntarily left.
Susanna never had another child, and Angelina died first, at age 35 in a cholera epidemic.
She was buried in Galveston; her grave site was lost in the Great Storm of 1900.
In 1857 Susanna was happily married at last, to Joseph Hannig, a German immigrant twenty years her junior.
They lived in Austin, where she died in 1883.
Because of her once-tarnished reputation, a marker at her grave reads simply, “Mother of the Babe of the Alamo.”

Liberty Gazette announces Shakespeare reading by Ada Bertha Théodore
On this day in 1855, the Liberty Gazette carried an advertisement announcing that Ada Bertha Théodore would be giving readings of Shakespeare.
As Adah Menken she went from poetry readings in Texas to a minor stage career in the South and on to fame and controversy for her daringly suggestive performance in Mazeppa; or The Wild Horse of Tartary on the city stages of the Midwest, the East Coast, and Europe.

Another chapter in Texas History
ADAH ISAACS MENKEN (1835–1868).
Adah Isaacs Menken, also known as Adelaide McCord and Ada Bertha Théodore, actress and poet, was most plausibly born Ada C. McCord on June 15, 1835, to Richard and Catherine E. McCord in Memphis, Tennessee.
Adah's life before her stage career is difficult to document because her elaborate stories about her beginnings indicate a variety of names, ethnic backgrounds, birthplaces, and genealogies.
Although it has been claimed that she attended Nacogdoches University, the first documented evidence of her presence in Texas appeared in a Liberty Gazette advertisement on October 8, 1855, announcing that Ada Bertha Théodore would be giving readings of Shakespeare.
Subsequent issues contained poems and essays attributed to her and datelined Austin City and Washington, Texas.
On April 3, 1856, in Livingston, Texas, she married Alexander Isaac Menken, a Jewish theatrical musician from Cincinnati, Ohio.
After two years of limited engagements at small theatres in New Orleans, Shreveport, and Nashville, Adah urged her husband to take her to his family in Cincinnati.
There she embraced Judaism; she occasionally even claimed to have been born a Jew.
She made her theatrical debut in 1857 as Pauline in The Lady of Lyons at Shreveport, Louisiana, and then appeared in Fazio, as Bianca, in New Orleans.
In March 1859 she made her New York debut as the Widow Cheerly in The Soldier's Daughter.
She published a number of poems in the Cincinnati Israelite.
Her husband's family, however, did not appreciate the attention lavished upon Adah in her unorthodox career.
The couple secured a rabbinical diploma dissolving their marriage, but Adah continued using Menken as her stage name.
On September 3, 1859, Ada married John Carmel Heenan, a noted Irish prizefighter, in New York.
A scandal ensued when Alexander Menken revealed to the press that he and Adah were not yet legally divorced.
Heenan left Adah pregnant with a son who died in infancy.
They divorced in 1862.
Adah continued to write poetry and to play minor roles until June 1861, when she was called upon to star in Mazeppa; or The Wild Horse of Tartary, a melodrama based on a poem by Lord Byron that opened at Albany's Green Street Theatre.
Already accustomed to male roles, Adah was game to try strapping herself to a horse for the climax.
In flesh-toned tights, under the dimmed stage lights she appeared to be nude.
She became an overnight sensation.
During the next few years the drama played the major northeastern and midwestern cities, toured the West, then was a great success in Europe.
She soon earned the highest pay ever earned by an actress.
While she attempted other roles, she always returned to Mazeppa.
Meanwhile Adah married and divorced two more husbands, Civil War satirist Robert Henry Newell (pseud.
Orpheus C. Kerr), whom she married in 1862 and divorced in 1865, and James Paul Barkley, a gambler she married in 1866 and left almost immediately.
By Barkley she had a son, Louis Dudevant Victor Emmanuel, who died in infancy.
Always longing for recognition as a poet, Adah associated with many of the literary personages of her time.
She admired Walt Whitman, and her posthumously published volume, Infelicia (1868), contained an early collection of free verse.
In the West she mingled with the young Samuel Clemens, Bret Harte, and Joaquin Miller.
In Europe she purportedly had affairs with French novelist Alexander Dumas, père, and with English poet Algernon Charles Swinburne.
Adah dedicated her book of verse to Charles Dickens, and George Sand was godmother at the baptism of Adah's son Louis.
Adah slipped out of her militant Jewish role after encountering anti-Semitism in Europe.
She spent her large earnings from the theater on luxuries and gave generously to friends, struggling actors and artists, and charities, so that she had little left at the end.
In the winter of 1867–68 she attempted without much success to revive Mazeppa.
Afterward, she returned to Paris and went into rehearsal for a revival of her other mainstay, Les Pirates de la Savane, but complications arose from an injury she had sustained while performing in London.
Her last performance was on May 30, 1868.
She died on August 10, 1868, and was buried in Paris.
Menken, Adah Isaacs ( Bertha Theodore ) (1835-1868)
Actor, Poet, Journalist.
Born in a suburb of New Orleans, Adah’s given name was probably Adah Bertha Theodore, but conflicting accounts of her early years and parentage (many generated by herself for publicity purposes) make it difficult to say with certainty.
(Fellow Pfaffian Augustine Daly claims that her true name was Adelaide McCord.)
At various points, she gave her father’s name as Josiah Campbell, James McCord, Richard Irving Spenser, and Ricardo Los Fiertes.
This father, who is sometimes noted as a "free man of color," died when Adah was a baby, and her mother remarried.
Her mother, believed to be a native of Pensacola, was stated to be either Creole or Jewish of Franco-Spanish descent.
Adah began her acting career in Louisiana, touring the South and West in various roles, and her writing career with "Fugitive Pencillings" in the Texas Liberty Gazette and in the Cincinnati Israelite.
In 1856 she married Alexander Isaacs Menken, son of a Cincinnati dry-goods merchant.
By 1859, however, at the time of her New York debut, she had divorced him (or thought she had!)
and married John Carmel Heenan, a prizefighter.
The couple separated after a scandal in 1860 over whether she was actually divorced when she married him.
During this period, Menken frequented Pfaff’s and met actress Ada Clare, poet Walt Whitman, and writer Fitz-James O’Brien.
In 1862 she married Pfaffian Robert Henry Newell (Orpheus C. Kerr), but the union did not last.
An article in Current Literature suggests that Kerr "unconsciously did the funniest thing of his life when he married the beautiful and seductive Adah Isaacs Menken, thinking that he could reform her.
She proved false and faithless to him, as she had to half a dozen other men, but Kerr sincerely loved her, and the blow, which his own credulity brought him, was a cruel and lasting one".
Menken did not let her romantic troubles keep her from working.
Her poems, later to appear as a collected edition, appeared singly in the New York Sunday Mercury and the Israelite.
Menken may have met John Brougham at Pfaff’s as well.
She later appeared in a short run of one of his plays, The Children of the Sun, which is said to have been written for her.
Her acting took her on tours through upstate New York and the midwestern United States.
Her greatest success occurred at this point when she starred in H. M. Milner’s Mazeppa, based on Byron’s poem.
At the climactic moment she appeared on a horse, garbed so as to appear naked.
The thronging public was appropriately shocked and titillated, and she toured the show in Europe as well.
In addition to the crowd at Pfaff’s, Menken joined other literary and artistic circles as well.
In San Francisco she performed at Tom Maguire’s Opera House for a group including Mark Twain, Bret Harte, Artemus Ward, Joaquin Miller, and others who met in Joe Lawrence’s Golden Era office.
In London such men as Charles Dickens, Charles Reade, Charles Swinburne, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, and Charles Fechter were among her guests.
In the meantime, she had divorced her next husband Robert Henry Newell and married James Barkley, who did not accompany her when she left for France in 1866.
In France she gave birth to her son Louis Dudevant Victor Emanuel Barkley, whose godmother was George Sand .
During her time in France, Menken is rumored to have had affairs with Alexandre Dumas and Charles Swinburne, the latter of whom may have modeled his poem "Dolorida" on her (Gilliland).
Menken died after suffering a collapse in Paris after rehearsals, just eight days before her collection of poems, Infelicia, which she dedicated to Charles Dickens, was published in 1868.
Speculations on the cause of her death include tuberculosis, an abscess in the side, peritonitis, or cancer.
Following her death, T. Alston Brown paid a final tribute to her: “Miss Menken possessed a character of mind peculiar from the many.
She was a lady of extraordinary intellectual endowments and of high literary attainments.
Her writings are redolent of bright and beautiful thoughts, and while very young she produced many poems and tales.
It was the study of her life to make all within the circle of her acquaintance happy and contented.
In her habits she was social and genial, of an equable, amiable and pleasant disposition.
Only those who knew her intimately could properly appreciate her noble qualities.
Her memory will long be affectionately cherished by a large circle of sorrowing friends, who have known and fully appreciated her many excellent traits of character”.
Adah Isaacs Menken
Actress, 1835?
–1868
Adah Menken dazzled stage audiences across two continents with her daring and beauty.
Enhancing her mystique were conflicting tales about her background—rumors of Creole parentage, circus horsemanship, a young romance in Cuba, Indian captivity, and rescue by Texas Rangers.
Most likely she was raised as Ada Bertha Theodore in New Orleans.
Certainly she was living in Texas by 1855, when a Liberty newspaper published poems and essays and announced Shakespeare readings by her.
In 1856 Adah married Alexander Menken, a traveling musician, in Livingston, Texas.
She moved with him to Cincinnati, where she plunged into Jewish issues.
Adah claimed to be Jewish by birth.
She wrote for The Israelite, fervently advocating for Jewish communities worldwide.
Lured by the stage, Adah played roles in Louisiana and New York.
When she and Menken divorced, she retained his name through three subsequent marriages.
Adah’s career break came in 1860, when she was cast in Mazeppa, a dramatization of Lord Byron’s poem.
In the grand finale, she rode bareback across the stage apparently nude (actually wearing a body stocking).
It was a sensation.
Adah performed to packed houses in New York City, Virginia City, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, London, and Paris.
But she craved esteem as an intellectual and writer.
Most of Adah’s poetry seems flamboyant today, yet she counted among her friends such notables as Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Bret Harte, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Charles Dickens, George Sand, and Alexandre Dumas.
Adah fell ill after a performance in Paris and died at the age of 33.
From her deathbed she wrote, "I am lost to art and life.
Yet when all is said and done, have I not at my age tasted more of life than most women who live to be a hundred?"
Quotations
The unshrined ghosts of wasted hours and of lost loves are always tugging at my heart. . . . The body and the soul don’t fit each other.
Adah Isaacs Menken (1835-1868) was a dancer, performer and poet.
Her origins were obscure even in her lifetime, but she seems to have been born as Adelaide or Ada C. McCord in Louisiana, and she took the stage name Ada Bertha Theodore until her first marriage.
She had a short but sensational career as an actress, her fame due as much to her own genius for self-promotion as to talent.
Her most famous role was playing a man in Byron’s Mazeppa, wearing a flesh-colored body stocking to appear nearly nude, a shocking thing to do at the time, and this photograph portrays her in that role.
Menken wore her hair short, smoked at her press conferences, and flaunted her connections with famous men.
She married six times.
Her first marriage was to Alexander Isaacs Menken, who was Jewish and for whom she converted; she remained in the faith until her death.
Her origins are disputed, with reports of lineage that includes a Spanish Jewish father, a New Orleans creole mother, and a free Black father, among other accounts.
Menken seems to have reveled in this kind of dramatic ambiguity.
From 1864 to 1866, Menken took her Mazeppa role to London and Paris, where it had enormous success, in part due to her notoriety, but attention waned as the novelty wore off.
Menken died in Paris in 1868.
The photographer Charles Reutlinger (1816-1881?)
was born in Karlsruhe, Germany, and opened a studio in Paris in 1850, where his clients included the upper echelons of society.
Menken visited his studio during her European theatrical tour.
Menken would have used copies of this carte de visit for publicity and sales for the Mazeppa production.
A contemporary (but not necessarily reliable) account of Menken’s life may be read here.
A collection of Menken’s poetry, Infelicia, may be read here.Adah Issacs Menken managed to flout many of the most hardened conventions of her time: she converted to marry a Jew, she smoked, she wrote and published on topics a "lady" would not discuss in that era, she appeared on stage nearly nude, she divorced five times, she dressed as a man for roles on the stage -- to name some of her transgressions.
Add to this the strong possibility that she was mixed race and her career raises important questions about the performative nature of both racial and gender identity.
What did it take to "pass" over these lines as boldly as Menken did?
How was it possible for her to have public success at all when she violated some of the most stubborn taboos of her society?

Houston Direct Navigation Company chartered
On this day in 1866, the Houston Direct Navigation Company was chartered to improve transportation and navigation on Buffalo Bayou and avoid wharfage charges at Galveston.
It replaced the Houston Navigation Company, which dominated shipping in the 1850s but failed to survive the Civil War.
Under an agreement with the C. H. Mallory steamship line, the new company shipped freight between Houston and New York.
In 1869 it transported an estimated 11,554 passengers and 815,466 barrels of materials, including those used in the construction of the International-Great Northern Railroad.
The company was operating four passenger steamers, eighteen barges, and three tugs by 1872, when it grossed $165,000 in a single month.
When Charles Morgan of the Morgan Lines bought the company in 1873, six steamers, forty barges, and five tugs were in operation.
In 1896 the name of the company was changed to Direct Navigation Company by the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, which purchased it from Morgan.
Rail competition made the company increasingly unprofitable, and it was abandoned in 1927, when terminal facilities were built at Clinton to serve steamers operating as the Southern Pacific Atlantic Steamship Lines.

HOUSTON DIRECT NAVIGATION COMPANY.
The Houston Direct Navigation Company was chartered on October 9, 1866, to improve transportation and navigation on Buffalo Bayou and avoid wharfage charges at Galveston.
It replaced the former Houston Navigation Company, which dominated shipping in the 1850s but failed to survive the Civil War.
The charter specifically denied the new firm exclusive rights to navigate and improve the channel and put it under the supervision of the state engineer.
Under an agreement with the C. H. Mallory steamship line, the company shipped freight between Houston and New York.
In 1869 it transported an estimated 11,554 passengers and 815,466 barrels of materials, including those used in the construction of the International-Great Northern Railroad.
The company was operating four passenger steamers, eighteen barges, and three tugs by 1872, when it grossed $165,000 in a single month.
When Charles Morgan of the Morgan Lines bought the company in 1873, along with the Buffalo Bayou Ship Channel Company and other channel interests, six steamers, forty barges, and five tugs were in operation.
Morgan's ship, the Captain Theissen, reached Clinton, seven miles below Houston, in 1876.
Between January 1869 and October 1881 the company moved a total of almost two million bales of cotton down the bayou.
In 1896 the name of the company was changed to Direct Navigation Company by the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, which purchased it from Morgan.
Rail competition made the company increasingly unprofitable, and it was abandoned in 1927, when terminal facilities were built at Clinton to serve steamers operating as the Southern Pacific Atlantic Steamship Lines.
Buffalo Bayou packets
After the war, Captain John H. Sterrett operated St. Clair and Silver Cloud for several months on his own, under the name of “Sterrett’s Galveston and Houston Daily Line of Steamers.”
The war had destroyed the old Houston Navigation Company.
Its partners, though, were determined to resume the trade, and in 1866 organized the Houston Direct Navigation Company.
Sterrett went in as a major partner, and assumed the position of superintendent.
To most travelers, the new enterprise was little different from the old one.
It offered daily service between the two cities, and several of the new boats, including Diana, bore familiar names.
But under Sterrett’s stewardship, the new company embarked on two new avenues of business.
First, the company would begin transferring passengers and cargo to seagoing ships — particularly the “little red steamers” of the Morgan Line — in the anchorage off Galveston.
In theory, this would allow the company and its shippers to avoid the high tariffs and warehousing fees imposed by the Galveston Wharf Company.
One passenger who rode the packets up to Houston during this period was Johannes Swenson, a young Swede who, with about hundred other young people, emigrated to Texas shortly after the Civil War.
After a harrowing passage from New York in the summer of 1867, Swenson and his comrades found themselves anchored at quarantine off Galveston.
After three days the port’s medical officer lifted the quarantine and permitted the immigrants to proceed to their respective destinations.
Swenson boarded a riverboat in the harbor and, without setting foot on Galveston Island, proceeded up the bay toward Houston.
Aboard the packet, Swenson later recalled,
we got the first good meal since we left New York. . . .  It was a beautiful moonlit night.
How delightful it was to stand on deck and let the leaves of the trees on shore pass between the fingers.
About midnight the ship stopped to take on wood.
I shall never forget how glorious it felt to put the feet on solid ground again.
It was also the first time on Texas soil.
After the wood had been loaded, the ship continued up the bay and at four in the morning we were in Houston.
The idea of transferring goods and passengers directly from one vessel to another was innovative and, for a time, effective.
But the island wharves effectively countered the practice by increasing the fees Sterrett’s boats had to pay when they landed to wood and load return cargo, giving the packet line little incentive to transfer goods and passengers “direct.”
In time, the practice died off, and the packets returned to their traditional terminals along the waterfront downtown.
A more prescient decision of Sterrett’s was to purchase a pair of small, powerful tugs, Superior and Ontario.
These tugs would be used for towing heavy cotton barges to Galveston.
Perhaps Sterrett recognized that the revitalized railroads, which could whisk riders between the two cities in under three hours, would gradually bleed off the passenger trade upon which his boats had depended.
This early, firm step into the towing business gave the Houston Direct Navigation Company an edge that would allow it to survive the end of the packet era.
For several years the packets ran much as they had before the war.
Traveling by rail in those days could be a bone-rattling, sooty experience, and many passengers continued to patronized the slower, stately riverboats.
The Houston Direct Navigation Company faced no serious competition from other packets, but the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad continued gradually to draw away the passenger trade.
Prices for cabin passage gradually fell, and freight assumed a more prominent place in the advertisements placed in local papers.
By 1873, the company was running two boats, Diana, commanded by Sterrett himself, and T. M. Bagby, as passenger packets, but also operated three vessels as “freight boats” — Charles Fowler,  Lizzie and, under charter, Henry A. Jones.
The freight boats were advertised “with barges, daily.”
In addition, the company operated twenty-two barges and three tugs.
The sidewheeler Lizzie loading cotton at Houston, c. 1873.
Though Lizzie appeared on the Houston Direct Navigation Company’s roster as a “freight boat,” she probably also carried passengers.
At right, on the north bank of the bayou, are barges like those used by the company to carry additional cargo.
Within ten years, the H.D.N.Co.
had abandoned its passenger service and switched over to barge operations exclusively.
Houston Public Library.
Serious accidents involving the packets occurred less frequently in the years after the Civil War, but they were still a cause for concern among the traveling public.
A particularly gruesome accident claimed the Henry A. Jones, under the command of Curtis Blakeman,  in early  1873.
She left the landing at Commerce street in Houston at dusk on the evening of February 13 and headed down Buffalo Bayou, carrying 412 bales of cotton and a barge lashed alongside, loaded with cordwood.
The first part of the trip passed without incident.
But about 5 a.m. on Valentine’s Day, a couple of miles above Red Fish Bar, those awake heard a loud report, followed almost immediately by shouts of “Fire!
Fire!”
It appears that the firewall gave way, sending out from the firebox flame which ignited the loose, ragged bales of cotton stacked nearby.
W. Dugat Williams, the First Pilot, was on the hurricane deck at the time and, upon hearing the alarm, ran down to the main deck.
Seeing that the fire was already too far gone to be stopped, he called to the man at the wheel, Assistant Pilot Dave S. Gordon, to abandon his post and save himself.
Williams, Gordon and some other men made it to the wood barge and cast off from the flaming steamer.
Twenty miles to the north, the company boat Charles Fowler had just rounded Morgan’s Point and begun the long run down the bay.
Set against the predawn darkness, the bright orange gleam on the horizon  caught the eye of Captain S. P. Christian, who crowded on the steam in a race to the scene.
He covered the distance in an hour and twenty-seven minutes.
By then, though, the Henry A. Jones had burned to the waterline.
The crew of Charles Fowler pulled the chilled survivors from the water and headed for Galveston.
The keeper of the Red Fish Bar lighthouse, two miles from the scene, had also seen the fire and managed to pull two more men from the water with his skiff.
Twenty-nine crewmen were saved, including Capts.
Blakeman, Williams and Gordon.
Twenty-three others died.
Liability for the boat and its cargo, roughly estimated at $50,000, fell squarely upon the shoulders of the Houston Direct Navigation Company, which had adopted the risky policy of underwriting its own boats.
Even at this early stage, though, the end of the Houston-Galveston packet trade was in clear view.
Freight had always made the lion’s share of the profit, but by the early 1870s the lines were devoting increasing tonnage to towing.
Sterrett retired from the Houston Direct Navigation Co. in about 1875, and the reins of the enterprise were assumed by Charles Fowler, an experienced pilot and master on the Houston-Galveston route.
Between 1877 and 1878, the Morgan Line bought a majority share in the company, and quickly began phasing out its passenger operations.
For the Morgan Line, the H.D.N.Co.
would be but one element in its expanding transportation empire, and was of more value for its freight business.
Sterrett went “over the river” in Galveston on June 18, 1879 at the age of 74.
He had, according to his obituary, “amassed more than a competence by the exercise of his head and hands,” but “like the majority of old Texans, in his liberal generosity, did not retain much of it, and died a relatively poor man.”
Though he was gruff and abrupt in his manner, another obituary noted, “no man had a kinder or warmer heart.”
His old colleague, Curtis Blakeman, died on April 28, 1884.
The next day there appeared in the Galveston Daily News a long-running advertisement for the Houston Direct Navigation Co. (below), promoting its “line of Tugs and Barges.”
The H.D.N. Co.’s towboat operation continued well into the 20th century.
But the days of the packets were gone, and the rivermen with them.
Advertisements for the Houston Direct Navigation Co. and the famous Morgan Line of Gulf coastal steamers, appearing together in the Galveston Daily News in April 1884.
The local agent for both lines was Charles Fowler, himself an old Buffalo Bayou steamboat pilot.
HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL.
The Houston Ship Channel, one of the busiest waterways in the United States, achieved its earliest significance as a link between interior Texas and the sea.
It traces its origin to early trade on Buffalo Bayou, which heads on the prairie thirty miles west of Houston in the extreme northeastern corner of Fort Bend County and runs southeast for fifty miles to the San Jacinto River and then into Galveston Bay.
Recognizing the potential of the stream, the brothers John Kirby and Augustus Chapman Allen laid out the town of Houston at the head of navigation on Buffalo Bayou in 1836.
The first steamboat, the Laura, arrived there on January 22, 1837.
As the waterway proved to be the only one in Texas that was dependably navigable, planters over a large area brought their cotton to Houston to be shipped by barge or riverboat to Galveston, the best natural port in Texas.
At Galveston cargoes were transferred to seagoing vessels and thence to market.
Goods destined for the interior came upstream, and visitors and immigrants made the route one of the most traveled in Texas in the prerailroad era.
Even after railroads and later automobiles diverted traffic, the route remained an important transportation artery for bulky goods.
Initially, citizens of Houston took responsibility for clearing and maintaining the winding route to the sea.
The city fathers established the Port of Houston on January 29, 1842, and the following year the Congress of the Republic of Texas granted the city the right to remove obstructions and otherwise improve the bayou.
After Texas entered the Union, free wharfage was given to boat owners who contracted to keep the channel clean.
In the late 1850s Houston merchants chafed at the policies of the Galveston Wharf Company, which controlled Galveston harbor, and attempted to reach the sea without going through Galveston.
After the interim of the Civil War, they renewed their efforts.
In 1869 they organized the Buffalo Bayou Ship Channel Company to improve the channel, and in 1870 they persuaded Congress to make Houston a port of delivery.
The United States Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the channel and recommended a width of 100 feet and a depth of six.
Still, because of inadequate appropriations, this effort brought few improvements.
At this point the Houstonians found an ally in Charles Morganqv, a pioneer in Gulf Coast shipping who had also run athwart the Galveston Wharf Company.
Desiring to bypass Galveston, Morgan bought the Bayou Ship Channel Company in 1874 and within two years dredged a channel from Galveston Bay to the site of present Clinton near Houston.
The first ocean vessel arrived there September 22, 1876.
Although Morgan is sometimes called "the Father of the Houston Ship Channel," he soon shifted his attention from ships to railroads, and his line abandoned the route in 1883.
The United States government purchased his improvements in 1890 and thereafter accepted primary responsibility for the channel.
Houston Congressman Thomas H. Ballqv, after becoming a member of the Rivers and Harbors Committee in 1897, won increased appropriations for the project.
Congress also approved a depth of twenty-five feet and the location of the terminus at Long Reach, now the Turning Basin.
Yet, by 1909 the channel had been dredged to only 18½ feet.
Impatient at the slow progress, Mayor Horace Baldwin Rice led a delegation to Washington to present the "Houston Plan," which offered to pay one-half of the cost of dredging the channel to twenty-five feet.
After receiving assurances that the facilities would be publicly owned, Congress accepted the offer.
Prior to Houston's offer, no substantial contributions had ever been made by local interests, but since then no project has been adopted by the national government without local contributions.
The Texas legislature passed a bill enabling Harris County to establish a navigation district.
The citizens then approved a bond issue of $1,250,000.
Jesse H. Jones arranged for the sale of the bonds, and the dredging began.
It was completed on September 7, 1914, and celebrated with great fanfare in the city.
Because of shipping conditions during World War I, its deep water development was delayed until after the war.
In 1919 an ocean-going vessel, the Merry Mount, took the first shipment of cotton directly from Houston to a foreign market, thus inaugurating a trade that made Houston the leading cotton port in the United States within a decade.
Oil, which had been discovered in Texas early in the twentieth century, increasingly rivaled cotton as the most important cargo on the channel.
Petroleum also led to the industrialization of the waterfront, for the long, protected channel with its nearby crude oil supplies proved an attractive location for oil refineries.
By 1930 nine oil refineries operating along the channel contributed to the channel tonnage.
Although the Great Depression briefly interrupted the progress, the Port of Houston ranked third in the nation in the amount of tonnage carried on the eve of World War II.
The war suspended normal shipping activities, but gave further impetus to the industrialization of the waterway.
In addition to increasing the demand for customary petroleum products, the war inspired the development of synthetic rubber based on a byproduct of petroleum.
Two synthetic rubber plants were located near the channel while the war was in progress, and after the war the channel became a center of the petrochemical industry.
In the postwar years the port also became a major shipping point for midwestern grain.
Growing foreign trade and new industry boosted the port to second in tonnage in the nation in 1948, and from then until 1964 it customarily ranked second or third.
Thecombination of industry and transportation facilities, including a network of railroads, trucklines, and interstate highways, influenced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  to select a site convenient to the channel as headquarters for the nation's space program in 1961.
Congress approved a project to widen the channel to 300 feet from Fidelity Island to the turning basin in 1945, and in 1957 army engineers recommended that the entire channel be deepened to forty feet.
By 1964, the fiftieth anniversaryof the deepwater channel, the federal government had expended $64 million for channel improvement and maintenance, and the local government had invested $28 million in port facilities.
In return, economic activities related to the channel yielded $148 million annually in taxes.
The channel-side industrial complex, valued at $3 billion, and shipping activities gave employment to 55,000 persons who received $314 million in wages annually.
The Port of Houston was the first in the nation to introduce container shipping.
By the 1970s 4,500 ships flying the flags of sixty-one nations passed through the channel annually.
The heavy traffic alarmed environmentalists who noted growing pollution in the area and others who believed the Channel Industries Mutual Aid, formed in 1955, offered insufficient protection in case of accidents along the waterway.
Between 1969 and 1972 some 700 vessel casualties were recorded, and in the 1980s and 1990s the channel received increasing attention from a series of oil spills, explosions, and collisions between tankers, freighters, and barges.
At the time 90 percent of all poisonous cargo traveling by water passed through the channel, which remained only 200 feet wide and forty feet deep at its maximum.
A single lawsuit sought recovery of $500 billion for damages.
New plans to widen the channel were proposed, along with further new industrial tracts and petrochemical projects, but remained to be implemented.
Charles Morgan
CHARLES MORGAN (1795–1878).
Charles Morgan, shipping and railroad magnate, was born on April 21, 1795, in Killingworth (presently Clinton), Connecticut, the son of George and Betsey Morgan.
He moved to New York City at the age of fourteen and soon began a ship chandlery and import business.
That venture led to investments in merchant shipping and ironworks and to management of several lines of sailing and steam packets trading with the South and the West Indies.
In 1837 Morgan opened the first scheduled steamship line between New Orleans and Galveston.
From that axis he expanded his regular service to Matagorda Bay ports in 1848, Brazos Santiago in 1849, Vera Cruz in 1853, Key West in 1856, Rockport, Corpus Christi, and Havana in 1868, and New York in 1875.
He was also both partner and rival of Cornelius Vanderbilt in attempts to establish an isthmian transit across Nicaragua in the 1850s.
During the Civil War Morgan's vessels were seized or chartered for military and naval service by both sides, but he profited from wartime charters and machinery contracts and resumed his regular routes in 1866.
As before the war the Morgan Lines dominated intra-Gulf trade through excellent service and his possession of exclusive United States mail contracts.
Much of Morgan's postwar career was devoted to integrating his water lines with rapidly developing rail carriers in Louisiana and Texas.
He was also deeply involved in the interport rivalries of New Orleans, Mobile, Galveston, and Houston.
Among railroads, he organized, reorganized, and managed the New Orleans, Mobile and Texas, the New Orleans, Opelousas and Great Western, the Louisiana Western in Louisiana, the Gulf, Western Texas and Pacific, the Houston and Texas Central, the Texas and New Orleans, and associated lines in Texas.
In the 1870s he also built, at his own expense, Houston's first deepwater ship channel to the Gulf.
In 1877 he established Morgan's Louisiana and Texas Railroad and Steamship Company as a holding company to control and operate his integrated water and rail services.
The system was absorbed under lease by the Southern Pacific Company between 1883 and 1885.
On July 5, 1817, Morgan married Emily Reeves; they had five children.
After her death in 1850, he married Mary Jane Sexton on June 24, 1851.
He died on May 8, 1878, in New York City.
MORGAN LINES.
The Morgan Lines, the first steamship line in Texas, was originated by Charles Morganqv.
Its first recorded voyage was of the steamship Columbia, which arrived at New Orleans on November 18, 1837, and made its inaugural voyage to Galveston on November 25, 1837, thus introducing Morgan into the economic life of the Gulf of Mexico.
In 1849, rebelling against port charges at Lavaca, Morgan built Powderhorn, which grew into Indianola and was for a time a chief port of the line.
In 1858 the Morgan Lines had three sailings a week from Galveston and two from New Orleans, and by 1860 the company had a monopoly of coastal shipping.
During the Civil War all of the vessels of the line were commandeered, either by the United States or by the Confederate States.
The Morgan Steamship Company took an active part in building railroads after the war to feed the ship lines.
In the 1870s pooling agreements were worked out among Morgan's Louisiana and Texas Railroad and Steamship Company, the Louisiana Western Railroad Company, and the Texas and New Orleans Railroad.
In the late 1870s Morgan worked with E. W. Cave to make Houston an inland port with better facilities for the line.
In the late 1870s or early 1880s the Morgan Lines were sold to C. P. Huntington of the Southern Pacific Railroad but continued to operate as the Morgan Line.
The fleet was sold to the United States Maritime Commission in 1941.

Another chapter in Texas History
SALT WAR OF SAN ELIZARIO.
The El Paso Salt War began in the late 1860s as a struggle between Republican leaders W. W. Mills, Albert J. Fountain, and Louis Cardis to acquire title to the salt deposits at the foot of Guadalupe Peak, 100 miles east of El Paso.
Fountain and Mills became leaders of the opposing factions.
Fountain, leader of the Anti-Salt Ring, was elected to the Texas Senate in 1869 with the expectation of securing title to the deposits for the people of the El Paso area, but Cardis and Father Antonio Borrajo of San Elizario aroused sentiment against the scheme.
Feeling between the two factions broke into open warfare with the killing of Judge Gaylord Judd Clarke on December 7, 1870, and Fountain soon moved to New Mexico.
The second stage of the trouble began in 1872, when Charles Howard, a Missouri lawyer, Democrat, and former Confederate officer, joined with Cardis to break the Republican machine.
After Howard became district judge in 1874, he became an enemy of Cardis, who controlled the Mexican vote and was the real boss of the region.
Their feud grew serious when Howard filed on the salt lakes in the name of his father-in-law, Maj. George B. Zimpleman.
This act outraged the Mexican citizens, who considered the lakes public property under terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and who were supported in their view by Cardis and Father Borrajo.
When Howard arrested two men who had threatened to go for salt in September 1877, he started a riot.
A mob held him for three days at San Elizario.
He gained his freedom by promising to give up his claim to the salt and agreeing to leave the country.
Four of his friends signed a $12,000 bond guaranteeing that his agreement would be carried out.
Howard retreated to Mesilla, New Mexico, still threatening to even the score with Cardis, whom he regarded as the instigator of the mob.
On October 10, 1877, he killed Cardis in a store in El Paso.
The Mexicans at San Elizario then demanded Howard's arrest and the forfeiture of the bond.
Maj. John B. Jones of the Frontier Battalion organized a detachment of rangers, put Lt. John B. Tays in command at San Elizario, and had Howard arraigned for Cardis's murder and admitted to bail.
About December 1, sixteen wagons left for the salt lakes.
Howard brought suit against the trespassers and left for San Elizario to press the charges.
In San Elizario he was besieged in the ranger quarters by a force led by Chico Barela.
The mob killed Charles Ellis and C. E. Mortimer and for four days made determined efforts to storm the rangers' fort.
A detachment of United States troops under Capt. Thomas Blair was summoned on the grounds that part of the mob was composed of aliens from Mexico, but Blair was dissuaded from entering the village.
On the fifth day of the siege Howard gave himself up to save the lives of his party.
In the belief that Howard was to be freed, the rangers also surrendered to the mob.
On December 17 Howard, his agent John E. McBride, and John G. Atkinson, who had put up $11,000 to satisfy the forfeited bond, were shot by a firing squad composed of men from Mexico.
The rangers were allowed to leave without their arms, and San Elizario was looted by the mob.
Within a few days several detachments of troops and a posse of American citizens descended on San Elizario, killing four men and wounding several others on the way.
The leaders of the mob and many of their followers fled to Mexico.
Indictments were made out against some of them, but no one was ever arrested or brought to trial.
A congressional investigation attempted to get at the facts, but no positive action was taken except the reestablishment of Fort Bliss, which had been abandoned earlier in the year.
Thenceforward no objection was made to paying for the salt.

The Salt Flats
Upon approaching the Guadalupe Mountains from the west, visitors traveling from the El Paso area will pass through a landscape of barren beauty.
The Salt Flats are a remnant of an ancient, shallow lake that once occupied this area during the Pleistocene Epoch, approximately 1.8 million years ago.
Salt collected here as streams drained mineral-laden water into this basin.
The basin, called a graben, formed about 26 million years ago as faulting lifted the Guadalupe Mountains and depressed the adjacent block of the Earth’s crust.
At the end of the last ice age, approximately 10,000 years ago, the lake dried up as the climate became more arid.
The salt deposits left behind would later become a precious resource to the people of the El Paso area.
A Precious Resource
Salt was considered sacred to Native American tribes such as the Apache and Tigua Indians, who used it in the tanning of animal hides and as a condiment and preservative.
In 1692, Diego de Vargas led an expedition in search of salt deposits in and around the
Guadalupe Mountains.
An Apache prisoner led de Vargas and approximately 20 Spanish soldiers from Socorro, through the Hueco Mountains, eventually arriving at the base of the Guadalupes after a four day trek across the desert.
After discovering the salt beds, de Vargas collected a sample of the salt and returned to New Spain (Mexico).
This expedition helped pave the way for future Spanish expeditions to the Guadalupes.
During the Spanish (1848-1821), Mexican (1821-1848), and early American (1848-1881) periods, Hispanic populations of the El Paso Valley region depended on salt from the Salt Flats.
After the signing of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, ending the American-Mexican War, over 75,000 Mexicans chose to remain in the United States as U.S. citizens.
Approximately 5,000 Mexican Americans lived in the El Paso valley region, formerly part of Mexico, subsisting primarily through farming and livestock grazing.
In order to supplement income from farming, the Valley Mexicans would endure the heat and the threat of Apache attack to collect salt.
They came from as far south as Chihuahua to load their wagons with this precious resource.
Mexicans and Mexican Americans from the El Paso Valley communities would make a 70 mile, two day journey from San Elizario to the salt beds.
The salt would then be transported by mule drawn wagons south to Chihuahua and Sonora, where it was an important trade item.
In addition to traditional uses, in Chihuahua the salt was used in the smelting of silver.
Prior to 1848, the salt beds, under Spanish law, were common land not owned by any one individual.
After 1848, under American law, these were unclaimed lands, available to anyone who filed there.
The Mexicans, believing that everybody had the right to the salt, never thought to file claims to the salt beds in the name of any one individual or group.
The Salt War
The El Paso Salt War began in the late 1860’s as a struggle between El Paso businessmen W.W. Mills, Albert J. Fountain, and Louis Cardis in an attempt to acquire title to the salt deposits near the base of the Guadalupe Mountains.
Mexican Americans of the valley communities, who had for years collected salt there for free, were now faced with the threat of being charged salt collection fees.
Mills filed his own claims to the salt beds and formed a group that became known as the Salt Ring.
Fountain, who had a falling out with Mills, later became the leader of the opposing Anti Salt Ring.
He was elected to the Texas Senate with the expectation of securing title to the salt deposits for the people of the El Paso area.
Cardis and Mills soon joined forces with Charles Howard, a Missouri lawyer.
Cardis helped secure Howard’s election to district attorney, but later became bitter enemies with him after Howard filed on the salt lakes for himself.
These actions outraged Mexican citizens who considered the lakes public property under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
Cardis later joined forces with Father Antonio Borrajos, an Italian priest who served the Mexican communities, to oppose Howard.
In September 1877, Howard started a riot when he arrested two San Elizario residents who attempted to go for salt.
An angry mob captured and held Howard for three days at San Elizario.
He finally gained his freedom by vowing to give up claim to the salt beds and leave the country.
He retreated to Mesilla, New Mexico, but quickly returned to murder Cardis in an El Paso store.
Angry Mexicans demanded Howard’s arrest.
Howard was arraigned for Cardis’ murder and placed under bond to appear in court in March.
In early December, a wagon train of Mexicans from both sides of the border left the valley, headed for the salt lakes.
Howard brought suit and left for San Elizario to press charges.
In San Elizario, he and a handful of Texas Rangers were besieged by an angry mob and held up for four days in the rangers’ fort.
On the fifth day Howard gave himself up.
The rangers also surrendered, believing that Howard was to be freed.
On December 17th, Howard, his agent John E. McBride, and John G. Atkinson were shot by a firing squad composed of Mexicans.
The rangers from the fort were allowed to leave after forfeiting their arms.
Within a few days, several detachments of troops and a posse of American citizens arrived in San Elizario, killing and wounding an untold number of people.
Most of the mob had already fled into Mexico, and no one was ever arrested or brought to trial.
The short lived war very nearly led to an armed confrontation between the U.S. and Mexico.
The unfortunate consequence of the Salt War was that Mexicans from both sides of the border were robbed, assaulted, and murdered.
An exodus of Mexican families from the San Elizario area immediately followed the event.
Eventually, the Salt Flats were claimed and the Mexican community was forced to pay for the salt they once collected for free.
For the Hispanic people of the El Paso Valley region, the Salt War was a struggle against Anglo attempts to exploit natural resources believed by the Mexican culture to be on communal land.
The transformation of the salt beds from communal to private ownership threatened the very survival of the Mexican border population.
They had constructed the road to Salt Flat and therefore had a vested interest in the future of the salt beds.
The El Paso Salt War was not merely a quarrel over control of the salt beds, but rather a struggle for the economic and political future of the area.
Salt Trade, Trails, and Wars
Few would believe that the desert surrounding El Paso contains a resource so valuable that people would travel hundreds of miles to utilize it and that two wars would be fought over access to it.
Salt is taken for granted today, but for much of human history, it was taxed, monopolized, regulated, fought over, and even used as a medium of exchange.
As the oldest and most continuously produced mineral in the state, it overshadows the Texas oil industry.
Carts, wagons, and, later on, trucks, transported loads of this mineral along trails and roads through the rugged Chihuahuan desert in the northwestern Trans-Pecos region.
Routes from the salt lakes and salinas, or natural mineral deposits, connected the Salt Flats west of the Guadalupe Mountains with San Elizario.
Another historically known salt trail extended from El Paso northward into New Mexico.
In recent years, archeologists have discovered remnants of these trails, historic routes of commerce over which this important mineral was carried.
Why Salt Is Important
Salt is 39 percent sodium, a chemical element that is necessary for survival.
Sodium controls blood volume, muscle contractions, the transmission of electrical nerve impulses, the contraction of blood vessels in response to nervous stimulation or hormones, the absorption of glucose, and the transport of glucose and other nutrients across membranes, especially the intestine.
Humans obtain the salt they need primarily from meat and secondarily from plants and water.
But these sources do not always provide the body with enough salt, forcing humans to seek it elsewhere.
Salt also has uses for humans other than physiological ones.
Before the advent of refrigeration, salt was used to cure and preserve meat.
Because herbivorous (plant-eating) animals are attracted to salt licks and salt springs, Native Americans often lay in ambush at such places or created artificial salt licks to lure the animals.
In colonial New Spain, salt was necessary for treating leather, stabilizing dyes, and, above all, mining silver.
The salt deposits of western Texas and southern New Mexico are remnants of ancient seas that have dried up.
The remaining salt has percolated up through the ancient sea bed and dried on the surface, making a salt crust that, before intensive mining, was several feet thick in some areas.
These salinas are concentrated at Lake Lucero, 186 kilometers (116 miles) north of El Paso in the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico, and at the base of the Guadalupe Mountains, west of El Paso.
The salt they provided was an essential resource for the native people of the area, who visited them for thousands of years.
Salt may have even been exchanged throughout the Jornado Mogollon region, perhaps as far away as Casas Grandes in Chihuahua, Mexico.
When the Spanish arrived, salt from the salinas became essential both for the operation of the silver mines in Parral and for the survival of the Spanish citizens and Native Americans of the El Paso area.
Historic Conflicts
In 1647, Diego Romo de Vivar petitioned the governor of Nueva Vizcaya for permission to exploit a salina in the Guadalupe Mountains.
Diego de Vargas, governor and captain general of Nuevo México, discovered additional salinas in the Guadalupe Mountains in 1692 and reported that their salt crusts were so thick that they had to be chipped away with a pick and that they re-formed within a few days of being removed, so that the salt could be continually mined.
It is not clear from their records when the salinas of Lake Lucero were discovered by the Spanish, but the silver miners of Parral were exploiting them by 1709 and perhaps as early as 1657.
The salinas of Lake Lucero and the Guadalupe Mountains were used initially by the silver miners of Parral, but by the 18th century the people of the El Paso area were using them, too.
They undertook annual journeys to the salinas with soldiers, who protected them from attack by hostile Apache groups.
The San Andres Salt Trail was established in 1824 to transport salt from the Lake Lucero salinas to communities in the Rio Grande valley south of El Paso.
In the mid-19th century, two conflicts arose over the political and economic jurisdiction of the salinas of the El Paso area.
The roots of these conflicts, known as the Salt Wars, lie in the enduring historical threads of two great colonial empires, Spain and Britain, each with very different world views as codified in laws that governed rights to the salt.
The Salt Wars occurred during the ebb and flow of historical influences as the political and cultural boundaries of the United States and Mexico, inheritors of the colonial legal systems, were being resolved.
These conflicts reverberated far beyond the remote borderlands where they played out, and substantially contributed to the establishment of the modern geopolitical setting.
According to Spanish law, the title to all mines and minerals (including salt) belonged to the government, and the king had long ago granted the inhabitants of New Spain the right to freely gather it.
When Texas, which initially included eastern New Mexico, became part of the United States in 1848, the law changed to British common law, which dictated that the title to minerals belonged to the owner of the land on which they sat.
Several influential Texans took advantage of this turn of events and formed a partnership to exploit the salinas of Lake Lucero, which they thought could prove to be very lucrative.
The partners obtained certificates to the land in 1850, shortly before Texas ceded eastern New Mexico to the federal government.
Though the partners’ claim to Lake Lucero was questionable at best, they were anxious to make a profit and subleased the land to James W. Magoffin in 1852.
Magoffin attempted to levy a fee for gathering salt at the salinas of Lake Lucero, but had trouble enforcing it.
In January of 1854, he received a tip that a large group of citizens from the village of Doña Ana, New Mexico was on its way to Lake Lucero to gather salt.
Magoffin reported this to the sheriff who gathered a posse to confront them.
When the two groups met a gun battle ensued, fatally injuring three New Mexicans and forcing all of them to abandon their animals and carts.
New Mexico officials indicted Magoffin on a charge of unlawful assembly and assault with intent to kill and requested that he be extradited from Texas.
Magoffin responded by surrendering the animals and carts to their rightful owners and making restitution for the damages he had caused.
As a result, the territorial legislature of New Mexico passed an act nullifying the Texas partners’ land claim and guaranteeing the citizens of New Mexico the right to freely collect salt.
The San Elizario Salt War of 1877 resulted from a political situation that was similar to that of the Magoffin Salt War of 1854.
In 1877, Judge Charles Howard filed a claim to 320 acres covering the primary salinas of the Guadalupe Mountains.
He then closed the road that led to them and instituted fees for collecting salt.
The citizens of San Elizario were outraged and insisted that they had a right to freely collect salt from the salinas.
Howard intercepted a group of these citizens on their way to the salinas and precipitated a riot.
Howard was jailed for his actions, but was released upon payment of $12,000 and fled to New Mexico.
He returned a few weeks later and killed Louis Cardis, a popular leader of the group who claimed the right to gather salt, then fled again.
Howard returned two months later with several associates and 20 Texas Rangers.
In the ensuing battle, Howard and two associates were killed and the rangers were disarmed and expelled.
In all, 12 men were killed and 20 were wounded.
Only a few short years after the people of the El Paso area had died trying to defend their right to freely gather salt during the San Elizario Salt War, the salinas of Lake Lucero and the Guadalupe Mountains fell into disuse.
In 1881, the arrival of the railroad in El Paso meant that goods from all over the United States could be easily and cheaply shipped to the area.
Cheap salt from Kansas put a temporary end to the ancient tradition of gathering salt from the salinas of the El Paso area.
During the 1940s and 1950s, miners again dug for salt in the Guadalupe salinas, but irrigation on ranches in the area lowered the water table and diminished returns from the flats.
Surveys and Discovery
In January 2001, archeologists with the Texas General Land Office found traces of an old road in Hudspeth County while surveying a 40-acre tract south of the Hueco Mountains.
Visible over a 16-kilometer (10-mile) stretch, the road rested on thin soils atop a level substrate of white calcrete, a geological setting which favored its preservation.
Using old maps and other historical sources, archeologist Steve Carpenter working with the General Land Office identified what appears to be the 1863 route from San Elizario to the Guadalupe salinas.
The discovery of several artifacts, including tin cans dated to the latter part of the 19th century, indicated that the road was not a modern ranch road.
Designated as 41HZ571, portions of this trail are denoted in Creuzbauer’s 1849 map drawn for Robert S. Neighbors.
The road may have fallen into disuse after the Salt War of 1877.
Remnants of the San Andres Salt Trail also were identified along the North-South Freeway on the outskirts of El Paso, where a one kilometer (half-mile) stretch was visible as a series of deep, parallel ruts and braided drainage channel.
This north-south stretch was recorded as 41EP2901.
A large section of Fort Bliss in El Paso County and Dona Ana County, New Mexico was surveyed in a further attempt to identify traces of the San Andres Salt Trail northward from El Paso.
Although archeologists consulted various historic documents and maps, including an 1849 map of Capt. Randolph Marcy’s expedition showing the location of the Salt Trail, their efforts to identify it on the ground have not proven successful.
Visitors to the area can learn more about salt and the Salt Wars at the Los Portales Cultural Center in San Elizario.
The center has an excellent display with historic photographs.
Charles H. Howard
CHARLES H. HOWARD (1842–1877).
Charles H. Howard, judge and both instigator and victim of the Salt War of San Elizario, was born on Februrary 3, 1842, in Virginia, the son of William Henry and Sarah Catherine (DuVal) Howard.
By 1860 the family had moved to Gonzales County; Charles's sister Susan married William Lewis Davidson there in 1870.
Charles served as a private in the Eighth Texas Cavalry, better known as Terry's Texas Rangers, during the Civil War.
He settled in Austin, Texas, in 1870 or 1871, then moved to El Paso in 1872.
At that time El Paso was a stronghold of Radical Republicanism, but Howard saw an opportunity to establish the Democratic party there, singlehandedly if need be.
At least initially, his efforts met with considerable success.
He was appointed district attorney in 1873 and allied himself with Louis Cardis and Father Antonio Borrajo, the parish priest of San Elizario, against the Radical Republicans and the "Anti-Salt Ring" led by Albert Jennings Fountain.
In February 1873 the three drew up a petition to the state legislature asking for the removal of the El Paso district judge, a political ally of Fountain, and calling Fountain himself, who was then serving in the legislature, "a disgrace to our county and a blemish upon Your Honorable Body."
The petition bore more than 350 signatures, and although many were written in the same hand, the legislature decided to take action.
The judge was removed in April 1874, and Howard was appointed to replace him.
Unfortunately, the alliance between Howard and Cardis was about to rupture.
Howard resigned as district judge in 1875 and married Mary Louisa Zimpleman in Austin on December 31 of that year.
She died on June 25, 1877.
Shortly before her death, her father, George Barnhard Zimpleman, an Austin banker, had moved to El Paso, apparently enlisted in a lucrative scheme by Howard.
Howard filed on the salt deposits at the western foot of the Guadalupe Mountains in the name of his father-in-law, thus outraging the salineros, or salt dealers, of the El Paso area, who had regarded the salt deposits as a public commodity.
One scholar implies that Howard reneged on a secret deal with Cardis and Borrajo by which the three would split the fees to be charged for collecting salt.
Regardless of what actually happened, Howard and Cardis became bitter enemies.
Howard assaulted Cardis in Austin and in San Antonio, but Cardis refused to take action.
In June 1877, while Howard was en route to survey the salt deposits, he encountered Cardis at Fort Quitman and attacked him again.
Meanwhile, he had two salineros arrested for taking salt without paying the required fee.
On his way back to El Paso, Howard stopped at Ysleta to talk with the sheriff.
An armed group of Mexicans and Mexican Americans seized him there and took him to San Elizario; they might have killed him then and there but for the intercession of Cardis, who wanted to avoid a major conflagration.
They made Howard promise to renounce his ownership of the salt deposits and leave El Paso County immediately.
The outraged judge went to Mesilla, New Mexico, where he took refuge at the home of his old opponent, Fountain, and wired the governor of Texas that an invasion from Mexico was imminent.
Howard blamed Cardis for his humiliation in San Elizario; he returned to El Paso on October 7, 1877, and three days later shot Cardis to death.
He was arraigned for the murder on November 17 but was freed on $4,000 bail.
On December 12 Howard bravely or foolishly went to San Elizario, intending to make good on his threats to prosecute those who refused to pay the fee for collecting salt.
He and his escort of Texas Rangersqv were surrounded and besieged by an angry mob for several days before Howard gave himself up.
On December 17 he was taken out and shot by a firing squad of five men, all from the Mexican side of the river.
After they fired, Jesús Telles ran up and attempted to slash Howard's face with a machete.
He swung his weapon, but Howard twisted away, and Telles cut off two of his own toes instead.
The bodies of Howard and two of his agents, also shot by the firing squad, were mutilated and dumped down an old well about a half mile away.
Howard was later buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Austin.
Louis Cardis
LOUIS CARDIS (1825–1877).
Louis Cardis, El Paso political figure and first casualty of the Salt War of San Elizario, was born in the Piedmont region of Italy in 1825.
He served as a captain in Giuseppe Garibaldi's army before immigrating to the United States in 1854; he applied for citizenship in New York on March 28, 1864.
He moved to El Paso that year and became a citizen on July 19, 1869.
In El Paso, Cardis ran a store and became a subcontractor of the San Antonio-El Paso stage line.
He spoke fluent Spanish and took an active role in local politics, becoming associated with Father Antonio Borrajos, the priest of San Elizario parish.
Their roles as unofficial leaders of local Mexican Americans did not, however, prevent them from joining William Wallace Mills, Albert J. Fountain, Benjamin S. Dowell,qqv and others in the 1866 formation of the Salt Ring.
This was a group of El Paso businessmen who sought to acquire title to the salt beds at the foot of the Guadalupe Mountains, ninety miles east of the city, and begin charging fees from the Mexican Americans of the valley communities, who had for years collected salt there without charge.
The Salt Ring fell apart in 1868 after a quarrel between Mills and Fountain.
The latter thereupon became the leader of the so-called Anti-Salt Ring, but the scheme persisted, as did Cardis's involvement in political affairs.
In 1871 an opponent described Cardis as Mills's "right-hand man," and he became closely allied with the Democrat Charles H. Howard, who opposed Fountain, after Howard's arrival in 1872.
In 1874 Cardis helped secure Howard's election as district attorney, while Howard aided Cardis's successful campaign for the state legislature.
Within two years the two men had quarreled, most probably over Cardis's attempts to revive the salt scheme, and Howard wrote that Cardis was "a liar, a coward, a mischief maker, a meddler; such a thing as could only spring from the decaying carcass of an effete people."
In June 1875 Howard opposed Cardis for delegate to the state constitutional convention at Austin and defeated him at the precinct and district conventions; but Cardis ran as an independent and defeated Howard in the election.
In 1876 Cardis was reelected to the state legislature, which had cleared the way for Howard's appointment as district judge by removing the incumbent.
The feud between the two turned even uglier, as Howard twice attacked Cardis physically, once in Austin and once in San Antonio.
After Howard filed in the name of his father-in-law on the unlocated portions of the salt lakes, taking over Samuel Maverickqv's ten-year-old claim, Cardis fanned the discontent of the Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande valley.
In late June 1877 Howard encountered Cardis at the latter's Fort Quitman stage station and beat him again.
This time Cardis filed charges against Howard and had him indicted, and in September a mob of angry Mexican Americans held Howard for three days in San Elizario.
Eventually Howard agreed to let the courts settle the matter of the salt lakes and to leave the area forever.
On October 7, 1877, however, he returned to El Paso from Mesilla, New Mexico, where he had taken refuge.
Three days later he found Cardis dictating letters in the store of Solomon Schutz.
Howard killed Cardis, who had attempted to hide behind a desk, with two shotgun blasts.
Just over two months later Howard and two associates were executed by a mob in San Elizario.
Albert Jennings Fountain
ALBERT JENNINGS  FOUNTAIN (1838–1896).
Albert Jennings Fountain, lawyer, legislator, and Indian fighter, was born on Staten Island, New York, on October 23, 1838, the son of Solomon Jennings, a sea captain.
His mother was from a colonial Huguenot family.
Fountain was reared in the Episcopal faith and educated in New York public schools and at Columbia College.
He moved to California in the 1850s and worked as a reporter for the Sacramento Union.
While he was with the newspaper, he went to Nicaragua to cover the filibuster expedition of William Walker.
Fountain read law in the office of N. Greene Curtis and was admitted to the California bar in 1860.
In 1861 he enlisted in the First California Infantry Volunteers, commanded by Col. James H. Carleton.
Fountain advanced from private to lieutenant in this Union force as it marched from the Pacific coast over mountains and deserts of the Southwest to the Rio Grande.
After arriving too late to intercept Gen. Henry H. Sibley's retreating Confederate army, the California Column became an army of occupation for New Mexico and Arizona territories.
Fountain was assigned to the garrison at Franklin (El Paso) and at nearby Mesilla in the New Mexico Territory.
At Mesilla he met Marianna Pérez, whom he married on October 26, 1862.
They had four sons and two daughters.
Fountain participated in the Mescalero Indian roundup and the relocation of this group to Bosque Redondo under the guns of Fort Sumner and then commanded volunteer New Mexico cavalry against the Mimbreño and Chiricahua Apaches.
Wounds received in the Western Apache campaigns led to Fountain's hospitalization at Fort Bliss, El Paso, where he recovered and was discharged from federal service.
After the Civil War he and his wife made their home in El Paso, where he established a law practice and became a civic leader, a founder of the local Episcopal church, and a leading organizer of the Republican party in western Texas.
Articulate and forceful, Fountain advocated "militant Republicanism" during the Reconstruction of Texas.
His early political appointments included county surveyor and collector of customs for El Paso.
Fountain's oratory at the Radical Republican convention at Corpus Christi in 1868 led to his election as vice chairman of the convention and a major role in drafting the Texas Radical Republican platform.
When the military governor of Texas authorized elections in 1868, Fountain supported Radical Republican Edmund J. Davis for governor and was himself elected state senator from the El Paso district.
When the Twelfth legislature convened in Austin, Fountain was elected majority leader of the Senate.
He assisted in drafting Governor Davis's radical program for reconstructing Texas, and he worked for local needs, including the "frontier protection bill" to reactivate the Texas Rangersqv.
As the acknowledged political kingpin of western Texas, Fountain regularly was challenged by adversaries at El Paso.
He killed political enemy Frank Williams in a duel after Williams insulted him in a saloon.
At the second session of the Twelfth Legislature Fountain was elected president of the Senate; in the Thirteen Legislature he served as Senate minority leader.
His legislative proposals included extension of suffrage to women, which was defeated, and incorporation for the town of El Paso, which was approved.
As the force of Reconstruction in Texas diminished, Fountain's political base at El Paso evaporated.
In 1873 he moved his family back to Mesilla.
He became a powerful Republican leader in New Mexico Territory, where he served as speaker of the New Mexico House of Representatives.
In 1879 he became captain of the Mesilla Scouts, a militia unit raised to defend the town against Indian raids.
Fountain published the Mesilla Independent and was one of New Mexico's most prominent attorneys for nearly twenty-five years.
His success in obtaining indictments and convictions of rustlers in southern New Mexico-he had twenty convictions in 1894 alone-earned him a number of enemies.
On February 1, 1896, Fountain and his eight-year-old son Henry disappeared between Tularosa and Las Cruces; their bodies were never found.
Three men were tried for the murders but acquitted.
The disappearance is still the most famous unsolved murder case in that region.
William Wallace Mills
WILLIAM WALLACE MILLS (1836–1913).
William Wallace Mills, El Paso pioneer, second son of James P. and Sarah (Kenworthy) Mills, was born at Thorntown, Indiana, on February 10, 1836.
He received his early schooling there, and although he later was appointed to West Point, he never attended.
In December 1858 he followed his brother Anson Mills to the town of Franklin, which Anson later renamed El Paso.
Shortly after the election of Abraham Lincoln in late 1860, eight Southern states, including Texas, adopted ordinances of secession.
In El Paso the Anglo-Americans were almost unanimously pro-Southern, and at a local election on the question of secession, there were less than a half dozen opposition votes.
Two of these were the Mills brothers.
Anson left for Washington, D.C., to serve the Union cause and later became a brigadier general; his brother went to New Mexico to join Union forces there.
After Confederate forces occupied Fort Bliss in 1861, on one occasion they caught W. W. Mills in El Paso del Norte across the river and took him prisoner.
He eventually escaped to New Mexico but never forgot or forgave Simeon Hart, whom he held responsible for his humiliation.
With the restoration of Union control over New Mexico and El Paso in 1862 Mills, who had been named United States collector of customs at El Paso, gave full support to the federal district court at Mesilla, New Mexico, in the enforcement of the congressional law of July 1862, which provided for the confiscation of property of any person who had aided rebellion against the United States.
The law thus offered Mills an opportunity to settle an old score with Hart, whose property was seized.
The long struggle lasted for more than a decade, and even though Hart received a presidential pardon, it was not until 1873 that he finally recovered his property.
During Reconstruction Mills assumed the leadership of the local Republican party and formed the "customhouse ring," a vehicle for extending favors to local merchants, controlling appointments to office, and manipulating elections.
By 1868 the dominant radical wing of the Republican party in Texas was receiving strong opposition from those seeking a more moderate policy.
Mills was named a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1868–69 in Austin, where the radical majority selected Edmund J. Davis as president.
Mills supported the moderates, led by A. J. Hamilton, and as a diversionary attempt to weaken radical strength in the convention proposed to establish Montezuma Territory from El Paso County and Doña Ana County, New Mexico.
The proposal was rejected by Hamilton, however, who concluded that a division of the state would strengthen Governor Davis's hand.
Yet Mills continued to support Hamilton, whose daughter he married in early 1869.
Meanwhile, in El Paso the Republican leadership devolved upon Albert J. Fountain, who gave his full support to the radical wing.
The radical victory in the governor's race in 1869 brought Mills's removal from his post as collector of customs, thus sharply curtailing his local power and influence.
By 1872 radical rule in Texas had run its course with the defeat of Governor Davis, and in El Paso the Republican party was in ruins, shattered by the Fountain-Mills feud.
Mills's political career had come to an end, although he did serve as United States consul in Chihuahua from 1897 to 1907.
His memoirs, Forty Years at El Paso, remain the most complete account of that city during its formative years.
Mills and his wife, Mary, moved to Austin in 1910, where they spent their last years.
Mills died on February 10, 1913.

Chief Satanta
Kiowa chief commits suicide
On this day in 1878, Kiowa chief Satanta committed suicide by jumping out his prison window.
Satanta was born around 1820, probably in what is now Kansas or Oklahoma.
He first emerged as an orator at the Medicine Lodge Treaty council in October 1867, where he came to be known as the "Orator of the Plains," although that title may have been a tongue-in-cheek reference to his long-winded speeches rather than sincere praise for his speaking abilities.
In 1871 Satanta and his fellow chiefs Satank and Big Tree were arrested for their part in the Warren wagontrain raid.
Satank was killed while trying to escape.
The trial of Satanta and Big Tree at Jacksboro was a celebrated event, primarily because it marked the first time Indian chiefs were forced to stand trial in a civil court.
The jury convicted the two men and sentenced them to hang, but Texas governor E. J. Davis commuted the sentences to life imprisonment.
Satanta was paroled in 1873, but was re-arrested for his role in the attack on Lyman's wagontrain in Palo Duro canyon and in the second battle of Adobe Walls.
He was imprisoned in the Texas penitentiary in Hunstville until 1878, when, demoralized over the prospect of spending the rest of his life in confinement, he took his own life.

Another chapter in Texas History
Satanta
SATANTA (ca. 1820–1878).
Satanta (Set'tainte, White Bear), Kiowa chief, was born around 1820 somewhere in the Kiowa domain, probably in what is now Kansas or Oklahoma, during the zenith of Plains Indian power and cultural development.
Over the course of his life, however, the plains tribes were defeated, demoralized, and finally confined to reservations.
Satanta attempted to prevent the demise of Kiowa sovereignty and proved willing to use both diplomacy and warfare as means to secure his ends.
He rose to prominence in a fashion common among plains tribes: through success in martial exploits.
From the 1830s to the 1850s he participated in campaigns against the Cheyennes and Utes and is said to have raided as far south as Texas and Mexico.
By 1865 he seems to have become an important subchief, an achievement underscored by his presence, along with Guipago (Lone Wolfqv), Tene-angopte (Kicking Birdqv) and Dohäsan, principal chief of all the Kiowa bands, in negotiations leading up to the Treaty of the Little Arkansas River.
Like most treaties of its type, this agreement failed to ensure peace on the frontier.
White settlers continued to pour across Kiowa lands, and tribesmen, unhappy with the provision that reduced their domain to a small reservation, continued to raid settlements and harass immigrants.
This situation, unstable in and of itself, worsened significantly with the death of Dohäsan in 1866.
Without his powerful leadership, Kiowa unity dissolved as a number of subchiefs, principally Guipago, Tene-angopte, and Satanta, attempted to fill the void; their fierce competition set off a wave of raids across the southern plains during the fall of 1866 and into 1867.
In one instance Satanta and his party ventured into the Panhandle and, after killing James Box, captured the man's wife and four children, whom they eventually released (for a price) at Fort Dodge, Kansas.
Satanta's exploits gained him a certain degree of prestige, and in recognition of his position he was one of the tribe's representatives at the Medicine Lodge Treaty council in October 1867.
There Satanta, a tall, muscular man, came to be known as the "Orator of the Plains," although that title may have been a tongue-in-cheek reference to his long-winded speeches rather than sincere praise for his speaking abilities.
In any event, Satanta and Satank, the elderly member of the elite Koitsenko warrior society, signed the agreement for the Kiowas, an agreement designed to ensure peace by restricting the plains tribes to reservations.
The Medicine Lodge Treaty failed to resolve the sources of conflict.
Consequently, by early 1868 the Kiowas and other plains tribes resumed warfare on white settlements.
Fearing that isolated instances could erupt into a general Indian uprising, Gen. William T. Sherman called on Gen. Philip H. Sheridan to restore order.
Sheridan's plan materialized as the brutally effective "winter campaign" of 1868–69.
This operation, a series of military engagements designed to force the Indians to return to the reservations by destroying their homes, horses, and will to resist, achieved its fullest expression with Lt. Col. George A. Custer's decimation of the southern Cheyenne village on the Washita River on November 23, 1868.
Alarmed by Custer's reputed willingness to kill women and children in addition to Indian warriors, Satanta and Guipago decided to surrender.
Flying a flag of truce, the two chiefs approached Custer on December 17, only to be arrested, taken hostage, and held for nearly three months while the colonel reportedly sought permission to hang them.
Finally, in February 1869 Tene-angopte secured their freedom by promising that the Kiowas would quit raiding and return to the reservation.
Fear of army retribution kept the Kiowas on the reservation for about two years.
By early 1871, however, resentment over inadequate provisions had outpaced the military threat, and the Kiowas grew restless.
A series of raids followed, a new wave of violence that claimed the lives of some fourteen white Texans during the spring of 1871.
For Satanta, frustration over confinement was heightened when the tribe split into two factions, one led by Guipago and the other by Tene-angopte.
Responding to the apparent slight, Satanta returned to the warpath and, assisted by Ado-eete (Big Treeqv) and Satank, led a party of some 100 Kiowas against Henry Warren's wagon train near the present town of Graham, Young County, on May 18, 1871.
In the engagement the twelve teamsters were overwhelmed and seven were killed.
The Warren Wagontrain Raid, or Salt Creek Massacre, as it came to be called, sparked a sense of outrage across a frontier already weary of violence.
Responding to the survivors' horrific accounts and the settlers' calls for vengeance, Sherman dispatched Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie with orders to bring the offending Indians to justice.
Mackenzie's expedition proved unnecessary, however, because shortly after returning from the raid Satanta and his followers journeyed to Fort Sill to claim their rations.
While there, Satanta was questioned about the raid by agent Lawrie Tatum and proceeded to shock the agent by boasting that he had led the raid and was assisted by Satank and Ado-eete.
Horrified, Tatum turned the chiefs over to Sherman, who after hearing the same confession ordered that the three be sent to Jacksboro, Texas, to stand trial for murder.
Bound hand and foot, Satanta, Satank, and Big Tree left Fort Sill on June 8, 1871.
The trial of Satanta and Ado-eete (Satank was killed on the way to Jacksboro, shot down after he attacked one of his guards) was a celebrated event, primarily because it marked the first time Indian chiefs were forced to stand trial in a civil court.
Predictably, the Jacksboro jury convicted the two men and sentenced them to hang.
Yet pressure from humanitarians and a genuine fear of Kiowa retribution influenced Texas governor Edmund J. Davis to resist the will of many Texans as well as that of Sherman and commute the Indians' sentences to life imprisonment.
Subsequently, Satanta and Big Tree were transferred to the penitentiary at Huntsville, where they remained for the next two years.
In the incarcerated Satanta and Ado-eete the federal government possessed a powerful lever to ensure Kiowa passivity.
To this end, Indian agents promised the tribe that the two chiefs would be released upon evidence of proper behavior.
As a result, from the winter of 1871–72 through the summer of 1873 the tribe remained on the reservation.
Finally, in August 1873 Governor Davis, under pressure from federal Indian agents, arranged for the chiefs' parole, a decision that proved to be very unpopular on the Texas frontier.
Nevertheless, Satanta and Big Tree left Huntsville on August 19, 1873, and reached Fort Sill on September 4, where they were confined to the guardhouse.
Finally, on October 6, Governor Davis, federal officials, and the Indians agreed on conditions for parole.
Most importantly, the Kiowas agreed to remain on the reservation or risk the reimprisonment of Satanta and Ado-eete, and the two chiefs were set free.
Peace hardly outlasted the council, as by late October Kiowa and Comanche warriors resumed raiding.
By the next summer, settlements in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle were again under siege as Kiowa and Comanche war parties attempted to halt the destruction of the buffalo herds.
On several occasions-particularly an attack on federal troops during a ration dispersal at Anadarko Agency, an attack on Lyman's wagontrain in Palo Duro canyon, and the second battle of Adobe Walls (see RED RIVER WAR) on June 27, 1874-Satanta was seen with the hostiles even though he had given up his position as war leader.
Consequently, in the fall of 1874 he and Ado-eete were rearrested and charged with violation of parole.
Big Tree was imprisoned briefly at the Fort Sill guardhouse, while Satanta, judged the more dangerous of the two, was returned to the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville on September, 17, 1874.
He lived there until October 11, 1878, when, demoralized over the prospect of spending the rest of his life in confinement, he committed suicide by jumping out of a window.
His remains were buried in the prison cemetery until 1963, when his grandson, Kiowa artist James Auchiah, received permission to reinter him next to Satank in the cemetery at Fort Sill.
Satanta - Orator of the Plains
Satanta
Known to his people as Set-Tainte, meaning "White Bear Person," Satanta was a great Kiowa warrior who would later become the principal chief in the Kiowa Wars of the 1860s-1870s and was known as "The Orator of the Plains."
He was born about 1820, during the height of the power of the Plains Tribes, probably along the Canadian River in the traditional winter camp grounds of his people.
After developing a reputation as an outstanding warrior, he was was made a sub-chief of his tribe under Chief Dohasan while still in his twenties.
In appearance, he was described as tall, having a fine physique, erect bearing, and a piercing glance.
He fought with Chief Dohasan at the First Battle of Adobe Walls in 1864, and earned enduing fame for his use of an army bugle to confuse the troops in battle.
His speaking abilities gained him the title of "Orator of the Plains," and as such, he negotiated several treaties with the American government including the Little Arkansas Treaty in 1865 and the Medicine Lodge Treaty in 1867, which required the Kiowa to be placed on a reservation.
The treaty assured the Kiowa people rule over the lands set aside for them, but white settlers continued to pour across their territory and as a result the Kiowa continued to raid settlements and harass immigrants.
The unstable situation got worse when Chief Dohasan died in 1866 and without his strong leadership, competition between several sub-chiefs including Satanta, Guipago, and Tene-angopte, resulted in more raids across the southern plains from Kansas to Texas, during the fall of 1866 and into 1867.
During one of these raids in the Texas Panhandle, the Kiowa killed a man named James Box and captured his wife and four children, whom they sold to the army at Fort Dodge, Kansas.
By this time, Satanta's fame as a warrior and a leader was growing but he was unable to defuse a confrontation between the Kiowa and the US Cavalry near Fort Zarah, Kansas in 1867.
After a young Kiowa warrior was killed at the civilian camp near the army fort, the Kiowa gathered to avenge his death and the cavalry retaliated by attacking the Kiowa encampment, in which several children were killed during the brief skirmish.
The Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 failed to resolve the sources of conflict and by early 1868 the Kiowa and other plains tribes were actively attacking white settlers.
Fearing that these attacks were leading to an Indian uprising, General Philip H. Sheridan was sent in to restore order in the "winter campaign" of 1868-69.
Sheridan's strategy of destroying Kiowa homes and horses dampened the Kiowa's will to resist, especially after Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer destroyed the southern Cheyenne village on the Washita River on November 23, 1868.
Upon hearing of Custer's willingness to kill women and children, Satanta and Guipago decided to surrender.
Flying a flag of truce, the two chiefs approached Custer on December 17th, but were immediately arrested and held for nearly three months while Custer sought permission to hang them.
Finally, in February, 1869 Tene-angopte negotiated their freedom by promising that the Kiowa would return to the reservation and cease all attacks on white settlers.
However, by 1871, Satanta and his followers were obviously not satisfied with the reservation and began to make a number of attacks on wagon trains in Texas.
On May 18, 1871, Satanta, along with  Big Tree and Satank, led the Warren Wagon Train Raid in Texas.
Also known as "The Salt Creek Massacre", the incident occurred as Henry Warren was contracted to haul supplies to Texas forts including Fort Richardson, Fort Griffin, and Fort Concho.
While the freight train was traveling down the Jacksboro-Belknap Road on May 18th towards Salt Creek Crossing, they encountered General William T. Sherman, who had earlier allowed the Satanta and his men to pass unmolested.
Less than an hour later, the wagon train spotted the group of about 100 warriors.
Recognizing an eminent attack, the wagon train quickly pulled into a ring formation, but the 12 teamsters were overwhelmed by the warriors.
When the attack was over, the Indians captured all of the supplies and killed and mutilated seven of the wagoneer's.
Five men managed to escape and Thomas Brazeale was able to reach Fort Richardson on foot, some 20 miles away.
When Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie learned of the attack, he immediately informed General Sherman, who in turn dispatched Mackenzie to bring the offending Indians to justice.
Their mission; however, proved unnecessary as Satanta, shortly after returning from the raid with his men to Fort Sill, Oklahoma to claim their rations, was questioned by Indian agent, Lawrie Tatum.
The warrior, obviously using bad judgment, responded by boasting about the raid and a horrified Tatum quickly turned the chiefs over to General Sherman.
The warriors were then ordered sent to Jacksboro, Texas, to stand trial for murder.
Bound hand and foot, Satanta, Satank, and Big Tree left Fort Sill on June 8, 1871.
Satank was later killed while resisting a guard and Satanta was warned that he might be hanged for his crimes.
To this, Satanta responded: " I am a great chief among my people.
If you kill me, it will be like a spark on the prairie.
It will make a big fire - a terrible fire!"
Satanta and Big Tree were tried in Texas and sentenced to death; but Texas Governor Edmund Davis, overruled the court and the punishment was changed to life imprisonment.
While in prison, a visitor described him as "a tall, finely formed man, princely in carriage, on whom even the prison garb seemed elegant."
Just two years later, Satanta was released in 1873, conditional upon the good behavior of their people.
The following year, Satanta and his warriors were back on the warpath, attacking buffalo hunters and engaging in the what is known as the Second Battle of Adobe Walls which occurred on June 27, 1874.
In October, 1874, Satanta was captured and once again placed in the Texas Penitentiary at Huntsville.
Unwilling to spend the rest of his life in prison, Satanta committed suicide on October 11, 1878, by throwing himself from a high window of the prison hospital.
Big Tree, with other chiefs believed to be secretly hostile, were confined as prisoners at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.
After Big Tree's release, he continued to live on an allotment from the reservation until his death in 1929.
Satanta
Chief Satanta massacres teamsters
May 18, 1871:
The Kiowa Chief Satanta joins with other Indians to massacre a wagon train near the Red River in northeastern Texas.
One of the leading chiefs of the Kiowa in the 1860s and 1870s, Satanta was a fearsome warrior but also a skilled orator and diplomat.
He helped negotiate and signed treaties with the U.S. establishing a Kiowa reservation in Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma), but Satanta remained resistant to government efforts to force the Kiowa to abandon their nomadic ways.
The 1867 treaty allowed the Kiowa periodically to leave the reservation to hunt buffalo, but for more than a year, Satanta and other Kiowa continued to hunt and never even set foot on reservation lands.
Fearing the Kiowa hunters would never come to the reservation, in late 1868 General Philip Sheridan had them arrested and brought in by force.
From the start, Satanta detested reservation life.
He did not intend to become a farmer, a chore he considered to be women's work.
The beef provided by the Indian agents was stringy and vastly inferior to fresh buffalo, and he hated the tasteless corn they received.
In 1870, when the Indian agent finally agreed that they could leave on another of the hunts provided for by the treaty, Satanta and several Kiowa happily rode off to Texas in search of buffalo.
Along the way, they raided several white settlers, but the Kiowa were not identified and later returned to the reservation.
The following spring, Satanta grew more aggressive.
He joined a large party of other Kiowa and Commanche who bridled under the restrictions of the reservation and determined to leave.
Heading south to Texas, the Indians eluded army patrols along the Red River and crossed into Texas.
On this day in 1871, they spotted a wagon train traveling along the Butterfield Trail.
Hoping to steal guns and ammunition, the warriors attacked the 10 freight trains, killing seven teamsters.
They let the remaining drivers escape while they looted the wagons.
Again, Satanta and the other warriors returned to the reservation.
Informed of the Texas raid, the Indian agent asked if any of his charges had participated.
Amazingly, Satanta announced that he had led the raid, and that their poor treatment on the reservation justified it.
"I have repeatedly asked for arms and ammunition," he explained, "which you have not furnished, and made many other requests, which have not been granted."
Taken to Texas for trial, Satanta was sentenced to hang, but the penalty was later commuted to life in prison.
Besieged with humanitarian requests, the Texas governor paroled Satanta back to the reservation in 1873.
The following summer, Satanta again led war parties off the reservations, this time to participate in the Red River War from 1874 to 1875.
By October 1875, Satanta and his allies were again forced to surrender.
Despite his vocal protests that he preferred execution to imprisonment, Satanta was returned to the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville.
He fell into a deep depression, refused to eat, and slowly began to starve to death.
Transferred to the prison hospital in 1878, he committed suicide by leaping headfirst from a second-story window.
Massacre at Walnut Creek
In April 1973, floodwaters of Walnut Creek, near Great Bend, exposed human bones in the creek bank.
The Barton County sheriff was called to the site and he confirmed that several skeletons were present.
News broadcasts suggested that an undiscovered mass murder had been revealed.
Historical Society archeologists, suspecting that a different story was unfolding, searched 19th century archives and meticulously excavated the skeletons.
The remains of 10 adult males were discovered.
Steel arrow points, some embedded in human bones, proved that this was indeed a massacre but not a recent one.
Satanta, Kiowa chief, was sub-chief in 1864On the night of July 17, 1864, 30 teamsters with 30 wagons were encamped about seven miles east of Fort Zarah.
This fort was a small military outpost located near the Walnut Creek crossing of the Santa Fe Trail to protect wagon trains from attacks by Kiowas, Comanches, and Arapahos.
A military escort had accompanied the teamsters to Council Grove but had then returned to Fort Leavenworth with assurances that the trail was safe because of recent treaties.
A band of Kiowas had trouble with soldiers at Fort Larned on July 17 and they stole most of the fort's livestock and wounded a soldier.
At about 10 a.m. July 18, 125 young Kiowa warriors attacked the 30 wagons that were then about one mile from Fort Zarah.
The teamsters had few firearms and no military escort, in spite of the fact that they were under military freighting contracts.
The soldiers at Fort Zarah witnessed the battle and attempted a rescue but were forced to turn back when they realized that a larger party of Kiowas was nearby.
Albert Gentry, a surviving teamster, was the only armed freighter.
With his smooth bore firearm, he accounted for the only Kiowa casualty and escorted a number of teamsters to the fort.
Another freighter, armed with a bullwhip, kept the Kiowas at a distance until his small party could reach safety.
Man displaying scalpWhen the civilians and soldiers eventually went out to recover the bodies of their slain companions, they found the wagons plundered and 12 seemingly lifeless victims.
Ten men were indeed dead, but two were alive, though scalped and severely wounded.
The dead were buried in two graves near the crossing and it was these bones that had unveiled the massacre that was 140-year-old at the time the remains were exposed by the flood.
Robert McGee, one of the scalped survivors, was 14 years old when the attack took place.
He exhibited his scalped skull as a sideshow attraction for many years.
Relations between Native Americans and whites were tense for most of the 19th century.
Nomadic tribes native to the central United States signed treaties that forced them to give up their claims to lands they and their ancestors had roamed for hundreds of years.
Eastern tribes were relocated to lands in the area that became Kansas in the 1830s and 1840s and most were relocated to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) when Kansas Territory was created and opened to white settlement in 1854.
A few tribes retained reservations in Kansas but the number of acres they owned was reduced drastically.
Satank aka Sitting Bear
SATANK (ca. 1800–1871).
Satank (Set-Tank, Set-Angia, Sitting Bear), Kiowa warrior and medicine man, was born shortly after 1800, probably in what is now Kansas.
Though little is known about his early life, by the 1830s Satank seems to have established himself as a leading warrior at a time when intertribal relations on the plains were in a state of turmoil.
He took advantage of opportunities for advancement and eventually became a member of the elite warrior society known as the Koitsenko.
This group, comprising about ten of the bravest warriors of the tribe, was in a sense a martial caste, its prestige dependent upon success in warfare.
True to his status, Satank was first and foremost a soldier.
In the 1830s and 1840s he was occupied with intertribal warfare and gained special notoriety for highly successful expeditions against the Cheyennes, the Sacs, and the Foxes.
Gradually, however, as more whites moved onto the plains, Satank's activities became directed against them.
His targets included white settlements, wagon trains, and, on occasion, army outposts.
In 1864, for example, Satank was said to have been responsible for a raid on a settlement in Menard, Texas, as well as the murder of a guard at Fort Larned, Kansas.
Such exploits gained him a reputation as a daring and effective warrior.
Yet, while these military successes gained him substantial prestige in Kiowa society, Satank seems never to have become a chief of the first order.
Though some sources assert that he lost his claim to leadership because of an instance of cowardice, it is more likely that his path to preeminence was blocked by Dohäsan, the paramount leader of all the Kiowa bands from about 1833 to his death in 1866.
After Dohäsan died, Satank became one of several prominent leaders, but he never succeeded in consolidating his power.
By the late 1860s the Kiowas were an embattled people.
Dohäsan's death left the group without a unifying force, and internal bickering resulted.
In addition, increasing white settlement, intertribal warfare, disease, and a more substantial army presence combined to pressure the Kiowas into seeking some sort of accommodation with the white men.
Consequently, in 1867 the Kiowas, along with most other tribes of the southern plains, agreed to attend the Medicine Lodge Treaty council, in what is now Barker County, Kansas.
The Kiowas were represented by Satanta, self-proclaimed heir of Dohäsan, and Satank, now about seventy years old, who was described as "about five feet ten, sparsely made, muscular, cat-like in his movements," and distinguished by a wispy moustache.
Together Satank, Satanta, and several other Kiowas signed the treaty that forced the tribe to move to a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma.
Satank
When the bulk of the tribe settled on its new lands the following year, Satank was among them.
However, he seems never to have adjusted to confinement and was absent frequently.
His resentment only grew when, in 1870, his son, also known as Satank, was killed in Texas.
Reportedly, the old man was inconsolable and, after journeying to Texas to retrieve his son's bones, killed and scalped a white man.
He joined Satanta, a young warrior named Big Tree, and other discontented Kiowas, Comanches, and Plains Apaches to conduct a series of raids throughout the next year on settlements in North and West Texas.
On May 18 Satank and his compatriots attacked the Henry Warren wagon train, which was carting supplies to Fort Griffin, and killed and mutilated seven of the twelve teamsters.
The five who survived made it to Fort Richardson, where they related their experiences, later sensationalized as the Warren Wagontrain Raid, to Gen. William T. Sherman.
In response Sherman sent Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie and the Fourth United States Cavalry to search for the culprits.
Though Mackenzie failed to find the Indians, when he arrived at Fort Sill, Indian Territory, he found Satank, Satanta, and Big Tree already there and requesting rations.
Surprisingly, when questioned about the raid, Satanta bragged that he was the leader and proceeded to implicate Satank and Big Tree.
Satisfied that Satanta was telling the truth, Sherman arrested and imprisoned the Indians and determined that they would be transferred to Fort Richardson, where civil authorities would try them for murder.
Four days after meeting with Sherman, the three leaders, handcuffed and shackled, began their journey.
Satank refused to climb into the transport wagon and was thrown in by two guards.
The indignity of being transported in chains was too much for the old warrior, who was pledged to death before dishonor.
Under the cover of a blanket he worked to free himself.
While singing the death song of the Koitsenko, he tore enough flesh from his wrists to escape from the handcuffs.
Quickly, he grasped a knife concealed in his breechclout, sprang on the closest guard, knocked him out of the wagon, and grabbed his carbine.
As Satank prepared to fire on his captors, he was felled by rifle fire from several guards.
Satanta and Big Tree watched helplessly as Satank, mortally wounded, was thrown from the wagon and left by the side of the road to die.
So fearful were the Kiowas of reprisals for Satank's attack that no one claimed the body, which was scalped by Tonkawa scouts.
Eventually Satank's remains were buried, without ceremony, at the post cemetery at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.
His only known survivor, a son named Frank Givins, was known to be living in Carnegie, Oklahoma, in 1929.
He was said to be a medicine man.
Chief Big Tree
BIG TREE (ca. 1850–1929).
Big Tree (Ado-Eete), Kiowa warrior, chief, and cousin of Satanta, was born somewhere in the Kiowa domain at the time when pressures from the expanding Caucasian population were threatening the tribe's traditional way of life.
By the late 1860s the embattled Kiowas were forced to seek an accord with whites.
The agreement, arrived at during the Medicine Lodge Treaty Council in 1867, forced Big Tree and the Kiowas to move to a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma.
Frustrated by the confinement, Big Tree came under the sway of leaders of the tribal war faction at an early age.
He joined Satank, Lone Wolf,qqv and Satanta in raids on settlements inside Indian Territory and across the Red River in Texas.
He reputedly was involved in an abortive attack on Fort Sill in June 1870 but really gained notoriety as a result of his participation in the Warren Wagontrain Raid, or Salt Creek Massacre, of May 18, 1871.
After this incident, at the urging of Gen. William T. Sherman, the army moved to suppress the Kiowas.
Army activity proved to be unnecessary, however, because, within days of the raid, Satanta, Satank, and Big Tree arrived at Fort Sill to collect their rations.
There Satanta boasted of his role in leading the Warren raid and implicated Big Tree and Satank.
Sherman had the three chiefs arrested.
Big Tree attempted unsuccessfully to escape by diving through a window.
He was transferred with the others chiefs, in handcuffs and leg irons, to Jacksboro, Texas, to stand trial for murder.
At Jacksboro, in the first instance where Indian chiefs were tried before a civil court, Satanta and Big Tree (Satank had been killed on the way to Jacksboro) were convicted of murder and sentenced to hang.
However, the federal government, fearing Indian reprisals following the scheduled executions, pressured Texas governor Edmund J. Davis to commute the death sentences to life imprisonment.
Davis took that action despite vocal opposition from General Sherman and large segments of the Texas population, and in September 1871 Big Tree and Satanta were transferred to the state prison at Huntsville.
Big Tree and Satanta
The principal effect of this sequence of events was to divide the tribe more firmly between war and peace factions.
In Indian Territory federal agents recognized the danger and, hoping to control what promised to be a volatile situation, promised the tribe that the two chiefs would be released and returned upon promises of good behavior.
On August 19, 1873, after two years of serving as "hostages" to ensure Kiowa passivity, Big Tree and Satanta were paroled.
Their continued freedom, however, was conditional and could be revoked by any hostile acts committed by the Kiowas, even if the two chiefs were not involved.
Yet, despite the stiff parole terms, the Kiowas, allied with Quahadi Comanches, resumed raiding in the winter of 1873–74, and by the next summer Big Tree and Satanta seem to have joined in the attacks.
On August 22, 1874, a number of Kiowas, led by Satanta and Big Tree, combined with Quahadis and skirmished with troops during ration distribution at Anadarko Agency, Indian Territory.
From there the Indians moved onto the Llano Estacado in Texas, where, on September 9, 1874, a party of 200 Kiowas, including Lone Wolf, Satanta, and Big Tree, attacked Gen. Nelson A. Miles's supply train, some thirty-six wagons escorted by a company of the Fifth Infantry and a detachment of the Sixth Cavalry.
For three days the army held off the Indians until, unable to overwhelm the soldiers, the Kiowas drew off and returned home.
This was to be Big Tree's last military venture.
The latest series of confrontations convinced the army to step up its patrols across the Llano Estacado, an effort that made life miserable for the constantly fleeing fugitives.
Satanta and Big Tree turned themselves in at the Cheyenne Agency in Darlington, Indian Territory, in late September.
From there they were transferred in chains to Fort Sill, and on October 6 Satanta was returned to Huntsville, where he committed suicide in 1878.
Big Tree remained imprisoned at Fort Sill until the Kiowas were finally defeated in December 1874.
After his release, he spent the remainder of his life counseling peace and acceptance of the white man's ways.
His new direction was especially manifested in his drive to discredit the revivalist doctrine preached by the prophet P'oinka in 1887 and in his decision not to participate in the Kiowa Ghost Dance of 1890.
He was among those who requested a missionary and was instrumental in establishing the first Baptist mission on the Kiowa reservation.
By 1897 Big Tree's conversion was complete; he became a member of the Rainy Mountain Baptist Church and served as a deacon for thirty years.
He died at his home in Anadarko on November 13, 1929, his last act of leadership being his unsuccessful opposition to the allotment of Kiowa lands in 1901.
He was buried near his home in the Rainy Mountain Cemetery.

Mickey Newbury
Prolific tunesmith honored in hall of fame
On this day in 1980, songwriter Mickey Newbury was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Association International Hall of Fame.
A native of Houston, Milton "Mickey" Newbury, Jr., earned the reputation of being one of the best tunesmiths of his generation.
He penned songs for a diverse array of performers, including Andy Williams, Roy Orbison, Eddy Arnold, Ray Charles, Waylon Jennings, B. B. King, Joan Baez, Dottie West, Johnny Rodriguez, and many others.
In 1968 Newbury became the first songwriter to ever score Number 1 hits on the easy listening, country, rhythm and blues, and pop-rock charts at the same time.
His arrangement of a trio of Civil War songs known as "American Trilogy" became his best-known work and was favored by Elvis Presley as the closing number for his live shows.

Another chapter in Texas History
Mickey Newbury
MILTON [MICKEY] NEWBURY,JR.(1940–2002).
Singer and songwriter Mickey Newbury was born Milton Newbury, Jr., to Milton and Mamie Newbury on May 19, 1940, in Houston, Texas.
He attended Jefferson Davis High School in Houston, where one of his classmates and friends was Kenny Rogers.
In 1954 Newbury began singing as a tenor in a local doo-wop group called the Embers, who signed a recording contract with Mercury Records in 1956.
When he was seventeen he taught himself to play guitar, absorbing influences from the folk, blues, country, rockabilly, jazz, and border music of the Houston music scene.
He wrote songs and performed with the Embers until 1959, when he joined the United States Air Force.
After three years of overseas duty in England he returned to Houston and resumed his songwriting career.
Newbury worked at odd jobs and on shrimpboats in the Houston and Southeast Texas area, staying with friends and relatives until he moved to Nashville in the early 1960s.
Shortly after arriving in Nashville he met Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson, who recorded his songs and became his lifelong friends, along with fellow Houstonian Townes Van Zandt.
Newbury's songwriting caught the attention of Wesley Rose, who signed him in 1964 to Acuff–Rose Music in Nashville.
Country star Don Gibson sang the first Newbury hit song when he recorded "Funny, Familiar, Forgotten Feelings" in 1966, the first of twelve Newbury songs that he recorded.
In 1968 Newbury became the first and only songwriter ever to have Number 1 hits on four charts at the same time: easy listening, with Andy Williams's version of "Sweet Memories"; country, with "Here Comes the Rain" sung by Eddy Arnold; rhythm and blues, with Solomon Burke's "Time is a Thief"; and pop-rock, with "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)," recorded by Kenny Rogers and the First Edition.
In 1969 "Sweet Memories" made the country charts when it was covered by Dottie West and Don Gibson.
Around this time and the early 1970s B. B. King hit the charts with "Time is a Thief," Ray Charles recorded "Sunshine," and Jerry Lee Lewis had success with "She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye."
"Heaven Help the Child" won the "World Popular Song" contest at the Tokyo Music Festival in 1973.
Willie Nelson made the charts with "Sweet Memories" in the early 1990s, a tribute to the timeless quality of Newbury's songs.
In 1969 Newbury married Susan Pack, a former Miss Oregon and member of the New Christy Minstrels.
They moved to Oregon in 1974 and settled near Springfield in 1980.
Newbury continued to write songs and record there in his own studio, releasing albums on his Mountain Retreat label.
On October 12, 1980, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Association International Hall of Fame.
Newbury made more than fifteen albums of his own during his career.
On one of those albums, 'Frisco Mabel Joy (1971), he performed his arrangement of a trio of Civil War songs entitled "American Trilogy."
The medley of "Dixie," "Battle Hymn of the Republic," and "All My Trials" became his best-known work and reached Number 26 on the charts in 1971.
Elvis Presley loved "American Trilogy" and closed his live shows with it until his death; it thus became the last song Elvis performed in public.
Since then "American Trilogy" has been recorded by more than 100 performers.
Newbury's albums are full of mournful songs that are sometimes accompanied by a lonesome steam locomotive whistle.
Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings's hit version of Chips Moman's "Luckenbach, Texas" refers to "Hank Williams' pain songs, Newbury's train songs and 'Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain.'"
Newbury's songs have been recorded over 500 times by almost 400 performers in more than fourteen countries, making him one of the foremost American popular songwriters.
Artists who have each recorded three or more Newbury songs include Don Gibson, Roy Orbison, Waylon Jennings, Joan Baez, Kenny Rogers, Jerry Lee Lewis, Tom Jones, Johnny Rodriguez, Willie Nelson, Roy Acuff, Jr., Ray Charles, Brenda Lee, Dottie West, Buffy Ste. Marie, Eddy Arnold, Brook Benton, Don Cherry, B. B. King, Wayne Newton, and Perry Como.
Newbury struggled against emphysema for the last five years of his life, but continued to write and record while enjoying family life.
Susan said of him, "He was a wonderful husband and father.
He didn't put much stock in what the rest of the world did.
He just took care of his family.
We'd have kids, and he'd take the next year off to feed his family."
Newbury made his last public performance at the Kerrville Folk Festival in 1998, but kept contact with his many fans via his website.
He released his CD, Winter Winds, in early 2002.
On September 29, 2002, he died in his sleep in Springfield, Oregon, and was survived by his wife, his mother, three sons, and a brother.
In late 2003 Newbury's CD Blue To This Day was released.
He was honored with the President's Award by the Americana Music Association in 2006.
In 2008 he was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.
.
His digitally-remastered An American Trilogy album was released in 2011.
Mickey Newbury
Mickey Nubury
Mickey Newbury was born Milton Sims Newbury Jr. in Houston Texas, May 19, 1940 to Maime and Milton Newbury.
As a child, he was inseparable from younger brother, Jerry; a friendship that continued throughout his life.
In high school, Mickey decided to write songs.
As a teenager, he shut himself up in his room, writing poetry and learning to play guitar.
He organized a doo-wop group called The Embers.
In 1959, Mickey joined the Air Force and was assigned to England for three years.
When he returned to the United States, he pursued his dream of being a songwriter.
He lived in a ’54 Pontiac and traveled around Texas, Tennessee, and Louisiana playing gigs and working on shrimp boats.
Eventually he found himself in Nashville, and in 1964, signed a publishing contract with Acuff-Rose.
He moved to Nashville in 1965 and about this time, his first child Joe was born.
Shortly thereafter, Jimmy Elledge was first to cover a Newbury song, Just as Long as that Someone is You.
1966 was the year the music industry noticed Mickey Newbury.
Don Gibson had a Top Ten Country hit with Newbury’s Funny Familiar Forgotten Feelings, while Tom Jones scored a world hit with the same song.
In 1968, Mickey saw huge success; three number one songs and one number five – across four different charts; Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In) on the Pop/Rock chart by the First Edition, SweetMemories on Easy Listening by Andy Williams, Time is a Thief on the R&B chart by Solomon Burke, and Here Comes the Rain Baby on the Country chart by Eddy Arnold.
This feat has not been repeated.
That year, Mickey’s first album, Harlequin Melodies, was released by RCA.
Mickey met New Christy Minstrel member Susan Pack on a blind date in 1967 and would not see her again until 1969.
Soon thereafter, they were married and living on a houseboat on Old Hickory Lake outside of Nashville.
Over the next four years, Mickey released three albums that raised the bar on Music Row.
Produced at Cinderella Studios outside of Nashville, and utilizing Nashville’s best musicians, Newbury’s trilogy of albums - Looks Like Rain, Frisco Mabel Joy and Heaven Help The Child are often referred to as masterpieces.
Following the birth of their first child, Chris, in 1973, the Newburys moved to Oregon, to Susan’s home town, just down the street from her parents, to raise their family.
A daughter, Leah, followed in 1977.
In 1980, Mickey was inducted into the Nashville Songwriter’s Hall of Fame.
During the 80s, Mickey took a break from the music business to concentrate on his growing family and golf.
Stephen joined the family in 1983 and Laura was born in 1986.
In the early 90’s, he started writing, recording, and performing again, encouraged by his friends Bob Rosemurgy, Marty Hall, and Owsley Mannier.
In 1995, Mickey’s health began to fail, but he continued to produce beautiful music.
1995 to 2002 were some of his most productive years, during which time he almost doubled his catalogue.
He also directed his attention to other ventures, beginning work on children’s books based on his story-songs.
On September 29, 2002 he succumbed to a long time lung disease and passed away in his sleep at home in Springfield, Oregon.
Mickey Newbury’s songs have been covered by hundreds upon hundreds of artists; over 1,000 covers have been documented.
Mickey also recorded 25 albums over 35 years.
Though he considered himself a songwriter first and singer second, his own albums are critically acclaimed and highly desired by a very passionate fan base the world over.
Many consider him to be the best of the best.
Kris Kristofferson says, “God, I learned more about songwriting from Mickey than I did any other single human being.
To me he was a songbird.
He comes out with amazing words and music... I’m sure that I never would have written Bobby McGee, Sunday Morning Coming Down... if I had never known Mickey.
He was my hero and still is.”
Mickey’s love was the music, not the business.
Among Mickey’s peers, he was always seen as a champion of the songwriter.
Among his family members and associates, he was seen as a wonderful son, husband, father, and friend.
"It's clear Mickey Newbury was a major player in a musical revolution of sorts that swept through Nashville during the 1960's and 70's... revitalizing country music with fresh ideas; acknowledging a broader range of influences... and ultimately winning the industry a much larger fan base in the process."
Mickey Newbury
Mickey Newbury bio
Along with fellow songwriters such as Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, and Tom T. Hall, Mickey Newbury helped revolutionize country music in the 1960s and '70s by bringing new, broader musical influences as well as a frank, emotional depth to the music -- while at the same time never losing respect for tradition.
Newbury infused his country music with haunting beauty and spiritual melancholy, creating an impressive collection of introspective, emotionally complex songs that are more spiritual cousins of the work of Leonard Cohen than that of Roy Acuff.
(Newbury, in fact, calls himself a folksinger and has never toured with a band, preferring the ambience of a quiet coffeehouse.)
The fact that many of his songs became hits for singers from Don Gibson to Elvis Presley was proof that the industry and the public were hungry for a change.
Like many of his generation, however -- such as his friend Townes Van Zandt -- Newbury was better known as a songwriter than as a singer.
Newbury recorded 15 albums over a nearly 30-year period -- right up to 1996's Lulled by the Moonlight, a limited-edition release sold by mail order -- but his soft, beautiful tenor voice rarely reached the charts.
Newbury spent his teens in Houston absorbing a wide range of music, learning to play guitar, and writing poetry, which he began reading in local coffeehouses.
Folk music was on the rise at the time, and he soon turned to writing songs.
He sang in a vocal group called the Embers during this time (they were briefly on Mercury) and played and hung out in Houston's black R&B and blues clubs, where he was nicknamed "the Little White Wolf" by Gatemouth Brown.
Newbury joined the Air Force and was stationed in England.
After his discharge, he turned back to music.
In 1963, a friend of his landed him a writing job with Acuff-Rose, and Newbury moved to Nashville.
During the next several years, he became friends with such singers as Roy Orbison, Roger Miller, Kris Kristofferson, and Townes Van Zandt.
He was also instrumental in getting both Kristofferson and Van Zandt, among others, noticed in Nashville.
Harlequin Melodies In 1966 Don Gibson had a Top Ten hit with Newbury's "Funny Familiar Forgotten Feelings," and Newbury's writing career was off and running.
A long string of hit songs followed, recorded by such artists as Kenny Rogers & the First Edition ("Just Dropped In"), Eddy Arnold ("Here Comes the Rain, Baby"), and Andy Williams ("Sweet Memories").
Newbury's first album of his own was Harlequin Melodies for RCA in 1968, recorded in RCA's big Nashville studio (it's an album he later detested).
He quickly got out of his RCA contract and instead turned to a small four-track studio run by engineer Wayne Moss in a converted garage (becoming, before the word "outlaw" ever became fashionable, one of the first Nashville artists to work outside the studio system).
It was here that he recorded some of his best solo albums, starting with It Looks Like Rain for Mercury; this contained initial versions of two of his most enduring songs, "San Francisco Mabel Joy" (which he's recorded several times more) and "33rd of August."
'
Frisco Mabel Joy But Mercury didn't support the album, and so Newbury switched to Elektra in 1970.
With this label, he released a string of superb albums, including 'Frisco Mabel Joy, Heaven Help the Child, and the acoustic Live at Montezuma Hall; the latter was paired with a re-release of It Looks Like Rain.
These contained such songs as "Cortelia Clark" (about a blind street singer), the almost painfully lonely "Frisco Depot," and "Heaven Help the Child," a sweeping mini-epic of a song that makes references to Fitzgerald and Paris in the 1920s.
In 1972 Newbury had a Top 30 hit with "American Trilogy," a suite-like arrangement of "Dixie," "Battle Hymn of the Republic," and "All My Trials."
The song later became a major hit for Elvis Presley and a standard in his repertoire.
Nights When I Am SaneNewbury recorded three albums for ABC/Hickory in the late '70s and was inducted into the Nashville Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 1980, but he was more and more becoming something of a recluse.
He had given up concert touring some years before and also had moved to Oregon.
In the 1980s, he only released two albums.
In 1994 he resurfaced with Nights When I Am Sane, an acoustic album recorded live with guitarist Jack Williams.
Since he was out of the spotlight for more than a decade, though, he wasn't well known in contemporary country circles.
People familiar with his work, however, recognized Newbury as one of country music's most inspired and moving artists.
After fighting respiratory illness for several years, Newbury passed away in the fall of 2002 at age 62.

New Orleans Greys assemble in historic meeting
On this day in 1835, the New Orleans Greys, two companies of United States volunteers that served together in the Texas Revolution, were organized at a meeting held in the grand coffee room of Banks's Arcade in New Orleans.
Although the disasters at the Alamo and Goliad destroyed the Greys as military units, at least seven of them were present at the battle of San Jacinto.
The Greys were one of the few volunteer units able to claim Bexar, the Alamo, San Patricio, Refugio, Coleto, Goliad, and San Jacinto as battle honors.

Another chapter in Texas Histtory
NEW ORLEANS GREYS.
The New Orleans Greys, two companies of United States volunteers that served together in the Texas Revolution, were organized at a meeting held in the grand coffee room of Banks's Arcade in New Orleans on the evening of October 13, 1835.
The arcade owner, Thomas Banks, was a supporter of Texas independence, and his red-brick, three-story building on Magazine Street between Natchez and Gravier streets was often used for meetings in the service of Texas independence.
Nacogdoches alcalde Nicholas Adolphus Sterne was present at this meeting and offered weapons to the first fifty men who would volunteer for Texas.
By the evening's end nearly 120 men appear to have been recruited; no original muster role exists.
Two companies were formed, the first under Capt. Thomas H. Breece and the second under Capt. Robert C. Morris.qqv Weapons and equipment were provided, probably from the stores of the Washington Guards, whose armory was located on the second floor of the arcade.
Hermann V. Ehrenbergqv, who joined Breece's company, indicates that the uniforms were "grey...for service on the prairie."
Ebenezer Heath, a member of Morris's company, stated that "the color of our uniform was a grey jacket & pants with a seal-skin cap."
Indians around Nacogdoches mistook the Greys for United States regulars.
The descriptions seem to suggest that both companies wore the 1820s-pattern United States fatigue jacket and either the M1825 or M1833 United States forage cap.
The Greys' arms were described as "rifles, pistols, swords & large knives"; Morris's company possibly carried rifles, and Breece's men were issued United States-pattern muskets.
The two companies left New Orleans within two days of each other.
Breece took an overland route, up the Mississippi and Red rivers aboard the steamer Washita.
His company disembarked at Alexandria and then, avoiding Fort Jesup, followed the Old Spanish Trail to its crossing into Texas at Gaines Ferry.
Between the ferry and San Augustine, a delegation of local women greeted the company and presented it with a blue silk banner that bore the words "First Company of Texan Volunteers from New Orleans."
The company was welcomed with a public dinner at San Augustine.
At Nacogdoches, also, the Greys were treated to a dinner of roasted bear and champagne.
Here some two-thirds of the company were given horses before proceeding to San Antonio.
Morris's sixty-eight-man company sailed from New Orleans and arrived at Velasco on October 22, 1835.
There elections were held for company officers, and Morris was reconfirmed as captain; William Gordon Cooke of Virginia became second officer.
Morris's company proceeded to Brazoria by steamship and marched inland to Victoria, where some of the men were issued horses.
The rest secured mounts at La Bahía.
The company then proceeded to San Antonio to join the Texas army.
They arrived before Breece's company.
In San Antonio Morris was appointed a major and assumed command of a division made up of both companies of Greys; Cooke assumed command of Morris's old company.
Cooke noted that seventy men were in his company and fifty in Breece's.
The Greys took an active part in the siege of Bexar, in which Breece's company apparently suffered one killed and two wounded; Cooke's company suffered six wounded.
After the capture of Bexar both companies underwent a series of organizational changes as a result of the Matamoros expedition of 1835–36.
All but twenty-two members of Breece's company and one of Cooke's company left San Antonio under Francis White Johnson and James Grant.
Those who remained at San Antonio were under the command of Capt. John James Baugh.
When Baugh became garrison adjutant, William Blazeby took command of the company, all members of which died in the battle of the Alamo.
The company standard was among the flags captured by the Mexicans; it is now the property of the National Historical Museum in Mexico City.
The Greys who went south with Grant and Johnson became members of either the San Antonio Greys under Cooke or the Mobile Greys under Capt. David N. Burke.
After Cooke's departure with Sam Houston in January 1836, his company was commanded by Samuel O. Pettus.
Though a number of the Greys continued with Grant, including both Morris and Breece, most chose to become part of the garrison at Goliad under Col. James W. Fannin, Jr.
Nathaniel R. Brister of the Greys was promoted to regimental adjutant when Fannin reorganized his command in February.
Both Morris and Pettus were killed with Grant.
Nineteen members of Cooke's old company were killed in the Goliad Massacre.
Four members of the Greys escaped from the massacre, including William L. Hunter and Hermann Ehrenberg.
Three, including Joseph H. Spohn, were spared.
Although the Texan disasters at the Alamo and Goliad destroyed the New Orleans Greys as military units, at least seven Greys were present at the battle of San Jacinto, including William Cooke, the only senior officer of the Greys to survive the Texas Revolution.
Thus the Greys are one of the few volunteer units to be able to claim Bexar, the Alamo, San Patricio, Refugio, Coleto, Goliad, and San Jacinto as battle honors.
The New Orleans Greys Uniform
A Historical Perspective.
by Ed Miller
The New Orleans Greys, making up two companies of European, northern, and southern emigrant soldiers were organized out of a mass meeting at Banks Arcade in New Orleans on October 12, 1835.
Starting in November 1835, the Washington Guards, later known as the Washington Artillery, a New Orleans militia unit, also stored military equipment there.
The two companies, one being Captain Breeces's company, went through Nacogdoches, and the other, Morris' Greys, traveled via the Gulf of Mexico to Velasco, Brazoria, and Goliad.
Both companies reported for duty to General Austin in San Antonio in late November, 1835.
Both companies also picked up members on the way.
Nicholas Kelly joined Breece's company at Alexandria, Louisiana with his own uniform and military gear donated by a local businessman, and according to Hobart Huson's History of Refugio,  some citizens of the Refugio area also went on to San Antonio with Morris' Greys.
Both companies would see action in the subsequent Battle of San Antonio; a detachment would remain at the Alamo and would perish on March 6th with the rest of the garrison.
A handful was honorably discharged in January 1836, and most of the remaining members would merge with the Mobile Greys into new companies as a part of the Matamoros Expedition.
Many perished in the Goliad Massacre on March 27, 1836.
In the past few years the New Orleans Greys has received new attention as the result of Natalie Ornish's book, Ehrenberg: Goliad Survivor-Old West Explorer,4 and more recently Gary Brown's book, The New Orleans Greys, The Volunteers of the Texas Revolution.
Both have brought about new attention on the role of the American volunteer in the Texas Revolution.
The Ehrenberg memoir has received notable attention in the past six years, not so much because of a question of its authenticity as with the de la Peña diary, rather the issue is primarily with establishing a reliable English translation since the original account was written in German in 1843.
An article written by James Crisp in 1993, "Sam Houston's Speechwriters: The Grad Student, the Teenager, the Editors, and the Historians," in the Southwestern Historical Quarterly opened the proverbial "can of worms" identifying the flawed translations of this memoir.
Herman Ehrenberg, a survivor of the Goliad Massacre and one of the youngest members of the Greys, published his memoirs in 1843, and published two more editions of the same book in 1844 and in 1845, which has eluded accurate translation into English for over 150 years.
Edgar Bartholomae, a graduate student at the University of Texas in the 1920s translated Herman Ehrenberg's memoirs for his master's thesis.
An English review of Ehrenberg's work in 1845 only provided selected passages of the book, thus making Bartholomae's translation the first complete English translation after 80 years since its publication in Leipzig.
The problem, for Bartholomae was however, a hasty job to finish in time for graduation, which prompted translation mistakes.With Crisp's look at Bartholomae's translation problems, in particular, it has also been discovered that the description of the New Orleans Greys uniform was also in need of reexamination.
Ehrenberg provided a key description of the Greys uniforms.
Ehrenberg wrote,"Wir hatten uns alle schleunigst graue, für das Laben in der Prärie passende Kleider angeschafft, welche wir fertig in den zahlreichen Magazinen fanden und denen der Name unserer Compagnie herstammt."
Edgar Bartholomae translated this section as, "All of us had speedily purchased ourselves grey, for service in the prairie fitting uniforms, which we found ready made in the numerous magazines and from which the name of our company had its origin."
In looking at the original text, Dr. Louis E. Brister, modern languages professor, Southwest Texas State University, and translator with James Crisp for the upcoming translation of Ehrenberg has identified several important points in looking at Ehrenberg's descriptions of clothing and uniforms of the Texas Revolution.
Ehrenberg used the German word "Kleider," which was very strictly used for "clothing" to describe the Greys apparel, and that of other Texas troops, and Ehrenberg was very specific in using the word, "Uniform"to refer exclusively to references to Mexican military uniforms.
The term,"Magazinen"gets its origin from the French word, "magazin" or the Spanish word, "almazon," meaning simply warehouse or storehouse.
The description should read,"We all quickly purchased ourselves clothing, grey in color, suitable for life in the prairie, which we found ready made in the numerous stores, [the color] from which the name of the our company was derived."
This observation is consistent with other historical accounts, both primary and secondary, over the last 163 years, which have described the Greys uniform.
Apart from Ehrenberg's account, several members left limited descriptions.
Ebenezer S. Heath, writing to his mother in Massachusetts, March 10th, 1836 described their uniforms as a gray jacket and pants and a sealskin cap.
Charles Bannister and William L. Hunter both left brief descriptions of accouterments, cloaks and hunting shirts being worn by some of the men.
A recent discovery of an overlooked source has been brought to light by the descendants of Ambrose Fulton, Dr. and Mrs. John D. Tanner, which helps clarify what arms were obtained before the Greys left New Orleans.
Ambrose Fulton, a sailor and businessman recounted how officers of the Greys went throughout the city to obtain donations of muskets, rifles, and navy pistols.
One of only two copies is available at the Center for American History in Austin.
The 1845 English review of the Ehrenberg memoir, clearly reveals what kind of apparel the Greys received before leaving New Orleans, "These [the Greys] had ransacked the tailor's shops for gray clothing, such being the color best suited to the prairie, and thence they received the name of "the Greys";..." This is significant due to the fact it was written in 1845.
Ehrenberg could have provided input to the translation.
Henderson Yoakum, early Texas historian, provided another account describing Captain Breeces Company marching through Nacogdoches enroute to San Antonio.
As the Cherokee Indians watched on, "The appearance of Breece's company at Nacogdoches had a fine effect on the Cherokee Indians...Their fine uniform caps and coats attracted the notice of the chief Bolles.
He inquired if they were Jackson's men."
16Yoakum provided an account, which was relayed to him by Adolphus Sterne as secondary information, and was twenty years removed from the event.
This account has caused some to believe that the Greys wore US Army surplus.
There is a danger of reading too much into this account.
All that can be assumed from this description was that the Greys were uniform in appearance.
George Fisher, in writing to Stephen F. Austin on October 20, 1835 stated,"This route [El Camino Real] is the most circuitous, but the appearance of the volunteers from the U.S. has great effect upon the northern Indians and the slave population of the colonies, by making them believe that the Govmt of the U.S. has sent them to aid the Texians, and keep them in check against committing any depredations, upon the frontiers of the Colonies-..." American volunteers were sent through Nacogdoches to make a showing, in other words, to neutralize the Indians as a potential source of danger.
The emphasis was not on what they wore, it was on their numbers, and where they came from, being the United States.
According to Ambrose Fulton, the two companies drilled on Customhouse Square before leaving New Orleans.
They knew, to some extent, the military drill and ceremony of the day by the time they arrived in Nacogdoches.
Breece's company had a drummer, they received a flag at the Sabine River,and they also had artillery.
Breece's company also came from the direction of the United States along the Camino Real.
They did not have to be wearing US Army uniforms for anyone to ask a question if the Greys were Jackson's men in factoring in all of the above considerations.
This particular tribe of Cherokees entered Texas around 1819.
Their concerns from that point onward were keeping their tribal lands.
The powers that be, who the Cherokees dealt with, were Mexican authorities.
Granted there was some contact with US Army personnel from Fort Towson in August, 1827 with the Osage and Shawnee, but no mention is given that Cherokee chiefs were present at that meeting.
And most of all, if Chief Bolles knew what a US army regular looked like, why would he ask the question if they were Jackson's men in the first place?
It would be glaringly illogical.
Reuben M. Potter, a retired US Army officer, and a resident of Matamoros, Mexico in 1835-36 interviewed several Texas prisoners of war as they were brought to Matamoros.
Potter wrote to Henry McArdle, the famous Texas artist in 1874 that,
There were probably no uniforms among the defenders of the Alamo, though, as there was among them a remnant of the New Orleans Greys, there were possible in the garrison a few specimens of the dress of that company;...it would be a just commemoration to idealize one or more soiled figures in plain grey jackets, trousers, and forage caps.
Amelia W. Williams and Eugene C. Barker in their role as editors of the multi-volume Writings of Sam Houston described the Greys uniform as being simple work clothing found in the local warehouses in New Orleans.
In 1970 Joseph Hefter, famous military historian, in a letter in the Jackson Barracks Library, New Orleans ( figure 1) also stated in regard to the Greys uniform,
A casual remark, such as "ready made clothes suitable to prairie life...greyish color...found in the warehouses of the city" reveals to the trained eye, a whole chain of information sufficient to reconstruct the figures of these volunteers.
The shape and cut of such stock items found in the warehouses is well known.
For example, the dress of the So.
Carolina militia of 1836 on its way to the Seminole war, consisted of just such ready-made greyish prairie coats,..."
The idea of a simple grey jacket and pants, and a hunting cap, is not a new or novel description.
Rather, it is consistently the historical description for over 163 years.
That the Greys wore US Army surplus cannot credibly stand on Cherokee Chief Bolle's one question whether the Greys were "Jackson' men."
The simple question is not convincing enough to establish such a far-reaching notion.
There must be more documentation for this view to be believable.
Much more!
The U.S. army in the 1830's was very strict in the requisition of uniforms for the numerous American frontier posts, and Erna Risch's Quartermaster Support of the Army goes into considerable detail of the procedures that post commanders had to go through in the 1830s to receive and account for new uniforms for their men.
Stephen Osman, Director of Historic Fort Snelling, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and considered by many as an expert on the 1830s U.S. Army, states,
I have personally spent one week per year (each March) in the Commissary General of Purchases files at the National Archives for the past 15 years.In that time I have gone through 2000 boxes of documents...there appears to be a gradual using up of the pre-1832 uniforms by the regular army.
This is especially true with the service uniforms; perhaps less true with things like dress caps.
I have also never seen anything about any sale of "surplus" uniforms after 1832.
The Marines got a few items like shoes and caps, but the only items generally sold by the army during that time period were damaged things.
This was not the case after the War of 1812, when big sales were held in the teens.
However in the 1830s everything was simply expended in use.
In documents provided by Stephen Osman from the National Archives, it becomes apparent that army records show a definite phasing out of the grey uniforms by 1832-1833,
August 29, 1832
Irvine to Peter Fayssouz, Military Storekeeper
How many shoes will remain in store after completing the orders for that article you may have received up to date.
It is desirable that few shoes should remain after completing the issues to the army the present year as shoes in future are not to be supplied.
So of such articles in which a change of uniform is made, for instance coats, gray overalls, great coats and roundabout jackets, shakos, and knapsacks.
March 25, 1833
Irvine to John Garland
The coats of the 1st, 3rd, and 7th infantry will have to be of the old uniform.
In my letter the 7th February it was my intention to have said that the underdress, say roundabouts, jackets and woolen overalls, for 2 regiments would be of the new uniform but having been directed to use all the materials on hand in clothing these 3 regiments and also to alter the artillery to infantry coats, I did not mean to have it understood that the coats could possibly be of the new uniform neither can they now be as the coats for those 3 regiments are now all cut out and most of them are in the hands of the makers.
It may be considered fortunate that materials for making so many woolen garments were on hand as wool and woolens have advanced considerably within 20 days past and not less than 15% yet I regret exceedingly that my letter of the 7th February was so written as to admit of misconstructions.
There simply does not appear to be army surplus available in the 1830s.
General Persifer Smith, commander of the Louisiana militia in January 1836, only 2 1/2 months after the Greys departed for Texas, published his proclamation (figure 2) for calling up troops for service in Florida.
Smith required volunteers to provide for themselves all the necessary clothing, and that arms, provisions, medicines, and camp equipage would be provided for them by the army.
Military uniforms simply were not available in New Orleans at this time.
Even if there was US army surplus available for Texian emigrant volunteers, the choice would have been uncharacteristic for New Orleans militia units, based on Gen. Persifor Smith's descriptions of a vast array of uniforms seen throughout Louisiana in 1835 inspections.
Ehrenberg's own condemnation of the US army as composed of "whiskey-loving foreigners" would cause one to wonder why would he, or any of the Greys would wear a uniform associated with such contempt?
In looking at recently found federal court records of the trial of William Christy, chairman of the Texas committee, February, 1836, charged with filibustering, federal marshals inspected Christy's Texas donation records for violations of US neutrality laws.
In the 23 depositions taken for Christy's trial, only one reference was made to the purchasing of articles of clothing for the New Orleans Greys, nothing about US Army surplus.
And in one of the most clearly stated statements concerning the Greys was from Christy's clerk in his deposition,
The money had been paid to different persons, from whom articles of clothing, provisions, and other articles necessary to those going to a strange country, had been purchased.
That some money had been paid for arms, muskets, rifles, knives, canteens, knapsacks, blankets.
They did not go as soldiers, and he [Latham] does not know what was expected of them."
This was from a man who had direct contact with "the Texas business" as a clerk in Christy's office.
Latham's statement, an eyewitness, was consistent with Ehrenberg's quote concerning clothing for life on the prairie.
A 21 November 1835 Frost & Co. advertisement for assorted items, including men's and youth's seal and fur caps.
New Orleans Bee, 21 November 1835.
So, what did the New Orleans Grey's look like?
Historically, they wore a simple gray jacket and pants.
Alluding back to Ebenezer S. Heath's comment of a sealskin cap, admittedly, this continues to be elusive, since no caps from this period are still in existence today.
The style of the hunting cap was chosen based on Potter's description, with smooth leather based upon art of country folk artists such as William Sydney Mount of New York, 32 and advertisements in New Orleans newspapers.3According to Donald Kloster, Military Division of the Smithsonian Institute, the 1833 leather forage cap, also commonly known as the "hog-killer" cap, was made of Moroccan leather for line companies and goatskin for cadets.
Civilian sealskin caps were sold on the New Orleans market at this time, and were distinguished from fur caps in at least one advertisement (figure 3, left ) found in the New Orleans Bee in November 1835.
Fulton described that officers of the Greys went through the streets of New Orleans seeking donations of firearms.
He stated they received rifles, muskets, and navy pistols.
Any one who examines all of the available sources, both primary and secondary, describing the New Orleans Greys uniform, will find a common description; that of a simple grey jacket and pants, and a hunting cap suitable and durable for life on the Texas prairies, which was somewhat uniform in appearance as to what they were able to obtain.
The Flag of the "New Orleans Greys"
The New Orleans Greys were actually two companies of American and European emigrant volunteers organized out of a public meeting held at Banks Arcade in New Orleans on October 13, 1835.
The two companies were Captain Robert Morris' Greys and Captain Thomas Breece's Greys.
Both companies left for Texas in the latter part October 1835.
Breece's Greys traveled to Texas up the Mississippi River.
From there, they traveled up the Red River to Natchitoches, and on the Camino Real through Nacogdoches, and onto San Antonio.
Morris' Greys traveled via the Gulf of Mexico to Velasco.
From Velasco, they traveled on to Goliad and then San Antonio.
Both companies participated in the "Battle of Bejar" and the taking of San Antonio in December 1835.
A detachment of the Greys remained at the Alamo, while most of the original contingent merged with the Mobile Greys for the Matamoros Expedition.
The Greys joined Colonel James Fannin's forces at Goliad in early 1836.
Many of the original members of the New Orleans Greys were either killed at the Alamo on March 6, 1836, or massacred along with the rest of Fannin's men on March 27, 1836.
A few survived to tell their story, including young German emigrant, Herman Ehrenberg.
The ladies of Texas presented the Greys flag to Captain Breece's company at the Sabine River.
This flag is believed to be the only one taken at the Alamo by General Santa Anna:
The bearer takes with him one of the flags of the enemy's Battalions, captured today.
The inspection of it will show plainly the true intentions of the treacherous colonists, and their abettors, who came from parts of the United States of the North.
The flag has continued to be housed in various Mexican museums to this day.
In recent years, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to reclaim the flag and return it to Texas and the Alamo.

James Pike
Frustrated ex-ranger killed when he smashes his malfunctioning rifle against rock
On this day in 1867, Lt. James Pike of the First United States Cavalry allegedly died when his rifle, which had malfunctioned during an Indian attack, accidentally discharged when he smashed it against a rock in frustration.
Pike, whose birth date is unknown, arrived in Texas in 1859 and joined John Henry Brown's company of Texas Rangers.
With the outbreak of the Civil War, Pike left Texas and went to Ohio, where he passed himself off as the nephew of Albert Pike.
He joined the Fourth Ohio Cavalry in 1861 and saw considerable action as a scout, spy, and courier under Gen. William T. Sherman, who praised his "skill, courage and zeal" but warned him to "cool down."
Pike was captured in 1864 and imprisoned in South Carolina, but escaped and returned to Ohio, where he wrote his memoirs of ranger and army service.
In the reorganization of the army after the war, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the First U.S. Cavalry and saw at least some duty in California.
The Scout and Ranger: Being the Personal Adventures of Corporal Pike, of the Fourth Ohio Cavalry (1865) is highly readable and thought to be generally factual, though many of Pike's claims are demonstrably false.
J. Frank Dobie and John H. Jenkins both praised it highly.

Another chapter in Texas History
JAMES Pike (?
–1867).
James Pike, Texas Ranger and United States soldier, was the son of an outspoken newspaper editor.
As a youth he served as a printer's assistant in Ohio and Missouri before joining a party of horse drovers bound for Texas.
He arrived in Austin in 1859 and attempted unsuccessfully to secure work as a printer, then joined John Henry Brown's company of Texas Rangers at Belton on July 1.
For the next two years he took part in a series of campaigns against the Comanches, including John M. Smith's incursion into the Indian Territory and to the headwaters of the Red River in 1860.
When Texas seceded from the Union, Corporal Pike left the rangers and went north, where he passed himself off as the nephew of Albert Pike.
He joined the Fourth Ohio Cavalry on November 20, 1861, and saw considerable action as a scout, spy, and courier in Gen. William T. Sherman's army.
Sherman, who took an avuncular interest in Pike, praised his "skill, courage and zeal" but warned the scout to "cool down."
Pike failed to do so.
He was captured in 1864 and imprisoned in Charleston, South Carolina, then escaped and returned to Hillsboro, Ohio, where he wrote his memoirs of ranger and army service.
In the reorganization of the army after the end of the Civil War, Pike was commissioned a second lieutenant in the First United States Cavalry and promoted to first lieutenant on September 27, 1867.
He saw at least some duty in California.
Although it is not verified in Robert Heitman's definitive list of officers killed and wounded in action, the popular account of Pike's death on October 14, 1867, is as colorful and as revealing of his character as any of his life.
When Indians attacked Pike's unit at dinner, the lieutenant seized his rifle and rushed to the defense.
The rifle jammed, however, and in his frustration he smashed the barrel on a nearby rock, whereupon the gun discharged and killed him.
Pike's reminiscences were published in 1865 as The Scout and Ranger: Being the Personal Adventures of Corporal Pike, of the Fourth Ohio Cavalry.
This account is highly readable and thought to be generally factual, although many of Pike's claims are demonstrably false.
J. Frank Dobie considered this book "a bully story to be ranked along with the personal narratives of those other two vivid ranger chroniclers, James B. Gillett and N. A. Jennings," and John H. Jenkins III lists it among his basic Texas books.
I Whipped Six Texans
A Civil War Letter of an Ohio Soldier
edited by FRANK L. KLEMENT
James Pike, a grandnephew of Zebulon M. Pike, the noted explorer, was
an unusual soldier in more ways than one.
He was the son of Sam Pike,
an outspoken critic of the Lincoln administration and a longtime editor of
the Hillsboro Weekly Gazette, the organ of Copperheadism in Highland
County; while the son performed heroically on the battlefields, the father
was accused of secessionist sympathies.
James Pike's prewar experiences
bordered on the bizarre, his wartime activities provided adventure, and
his postwar years again exposed him to death and danger.
He was born at Leesburg, Ohio, on July 13, 1834, and he learned how
to "stick type" in his father's printing plant.
Later he drifted to Jefferson
City, Missouri, to work as a printer and then to Texas, where he served
as an Indian fighter and Texas Ranger.
After the Fort Sumter incident
inaugurated the Civil War, ex-ranger Pike returned to Ohio, partaking of
harrowing experiences along the way.
On September 17, 1861, soon after
his return to the Buckeye State, the intrepid adventurer enlisted in Com-
pany A of the Fourth Ohio Volunteer Cavalry.
A year and a half later
(on April 23, 1863) he was captured by Confederate soldiers in a skir-
mish near Bridgeport, Alabama, and soon after he was paroled.
He re-
A CIVIL WAR LETTER
joined the army, being detailed as a scout on August 23, 1863.
The records
show he performed his assignments with ability and zeal.
His letter of
November 4, 1863, to "Dear Father" reveals some of his achievements.
About seven months after Pike wrote his letter of November 4 he was
again captured by Confederates, in the Edgefield district of South Caro-
lina.
In time he was exchanged and paroled.
He was mustered out on July
15, 1865, and returned home to write the story of his prewar and wartime
experiences under the title The Scout and Ranger: Being the Personal Ad-
ventures of Corporal Pike of the Fourth Ohio Cavalry (J. R. Hawley and
Co., Cincinnati and New York, 1865).
The next year Corporal Pike re-
ceived a commission as second lieutenant in General William T. Sherman's
trans-Mississippi command.
In October 1866 Pike received orders to re-
port for temporary duty with Company A, Eighth United States Cavalry,
near San Francisco, California.
There Pike met his death during the
following year when Indians attacked the post where he was stationed.
During the noontime Indian attack, Pike's gun jammed and in a fit of
anger he smashed the barrel over a rock.
The cartridge exploded, and the
adventuresome lieutenant received a wound from which he never re-
covered.
The letter of November 4, 1863, to "Dear Father" was published in the
November 26, 1863, issue of the Hillsboro Weekly Gazette, nearly three
months after "father" Sam Pike had retired as editor-publisher.
Soldier
James Pike did not think he was bragging of his achievements--he was
merely reporting on his activities to his father.
Pike's exploits are veri-
fied by information in the Official Records and in Lucien Wulsin, The
Story of the Fourth Regiment Ohio Veteran Volunteer Cavalry (Cincin-
nati, 1912).
You wonder, perhaps, at my long silence.
I have not had an opportunity
to write sooner, although I have earnestly desired to do so.
You have, no doubt, been uneasy about me; but I assure you that I was
not culpable for this apparent neglect of duty.
If you only knew how busy
I have been, and the hardships, and privations through which I have
passed, and the dangers, that I have encountered and escaped, you would
not blame me; especially, as I had no opportunity to mail a letter, even
had I written one. . . .
Let me recount some of the events of the past few months!
I wrote you,
I believe, in August last--say about the 30th.
--Since then, I have made
a lone SCOUT from Bridgeport to the mouth of the Hiawassee river.
This
was before the advance on Chattanooga.
I have had a single handed fight
with a whole company of rebels; killed one man, and escaped the rest;
returned to Bridgeport; fell in with the rear of our army there; pushed
on and joined the advance, under General NEGLEY, on Look-out river,
before Stevenson's Gap; scouted for him all through the Dug Gap raid:
led the advance in both battles, and received the first shot in each of
them.
Near Stevenson's Gap, I whipped six Texans in one fight, single handed.
From there, I joined the lamented General LYTLE; (a braver man never
lived) was with him in the battle of Chickamauga the first day, on the
right.
The second day, I was with GEN. MCCOOK, a part of the time, and
residue, with Gen. THOMAS.
I passed the whole time of the three days' fighting, in reconnoitering
the enemy's positions, and was on the right, when it gave way before
the withering fire and concentrated charge of two whole corps of rebels.
God deliver me from such another affair!
We suffered most terribly in the retreat; but the rebels suffered far
more, in their eager pursuit of our men; for they did not reckon
GRANGER8 in the fight.
But he was there; and bitterly did the rebels rue
it.
They lost eight thousand, in killed and wounded, and prisoners, in
one hour of time.
This was HILLS' Corps9 of Virginia troops.
When WHEELER crossed the river, near Washington, I was on a scout
to Kingston, was cut off, and nearly captured at Washington.10 I am now
with Gen. CROOK, who commands our Division of Cavalry, and is now
acting Chief of Cavalry.11 I was with him in the fight near Washington,
the one at the foot of the Mountain, in Sequatchie Valley; the fight at
McMinville, the Shelbyville fight, the Farmington fight; (properly one
fight, two engagements,) and the skirmish at Sugar Creek.
I got the
first shot in all these, except the river fight, near Washington.
--Took
four prisoners at the foot of Cumberland Mountain, four at the river,
two at the Sugar Creek fight, and one in a charge along the road.12 . . .
We then come to this place--that is, after we put Wheeler across
again, at Lamb's Ferry.
From here, I made one scout down Flint river;13 got wrecked; come
back; started right off, down the Tennessee, in a canoe, with dispatches
from Gen. GRANT to Gen. SHERMAN;14 have just returned, and am im-
proving this my first opportunity to mail a letter home.
I have received several papers.
--They come regularly, when the mails
come; but we are so constantly on the scout, that it seldom overtakes
us.
I have not had a letter from you for a long time. . . . Have not
had a chance to draw any money since I returned; but "the talk is,"
that we are to be paid soon. . . . I run over the Muscle Shoals the
other night, in the dark--the most dangerous service I have done since
I enlisted in this service.15 I am well, fat, and ragged.
Write soon; and
believe me to be
JAMES PIKE
John Henry Brown
JOHN HENRY BROWN (1820–1895).
John Henry Brown, pioneer historian, newspaper editor, soldier, and legislator, was born on October 29, 1820, in Pike County, Missouri, to Margaret (Jones) and Henry S. Brown.
Although Henry S. Brown was involved in Texas affairs from 1824 till his death in 1834, his family remained in Missouri, where John Henry began working in a printing office at age twelve.
The younger Brown spent most of his adolescence working on newspapers in Pike County and St. Louis and received little formal schooling.
In November 1837 he moved to Texas to live with his uncle, James Kerr, on the Lavaca River.
Two years later Brown moved to Austin and began working on the Austin Texas Sentinelqv.
He was soon drawn into skirmishes with Indians on the Texas frontier and participated as a private in the battle of Plum Creek in August 1840.
By 1841 he had been elected first sergeant of a company of minutemen.
He moved to Victoria the same year, but he remained active in frontier warfare.
In the spring of 1842, in the wake of the Mexican invasionsqv, he joined John C. Hays's company.
In September of that year he suffered a hip injury in the battle of Saladoqv.
He then took part in the Somervell expedition and afterward returned to San Antonio, on January 7, 1843.
In April of the same year Brown returned to Missouri, where he married Marion (Mary) F. Mitchel on July 9.
He remained in his home state working as a journalist for almost two years, then returned to Texas with his wife in April 1845 and settled in a small community near Rock Spring.
In late 1846 he moved again to Victoria, where he gained employment on the Victoria Advocate and became a major of the newly formed state militia.
In 1848 he and his family, now including two sons, moved to Indianola.
There Brown founded and edited the Indianola Bulletin, contributed a series of articles on "Early Life in the Southwest" to De Bow's Review, and published a pamphlet on Texas history.
In 1854 Brown became associate editor of the Civilian and Galveston Gazette  and gained such popularity in Galveston that he was elected to the state legislature.
After his legislative service he was elected mayor of Galveston, in 1856.
He began a second term as mayor in 1857, but it was cut short by his reelection to the legislature.
Tired and suffering from ill health, Brown moved in 1858 to Belton.
He was appointed to a committee to study problems with placing Indians on reservations and became captain of two military companies formed in 1859 to enforce the committee's recommendations.
In this capacity he again saw action as an Indian fighter.
He also again took on editorial duties, this time for the Belton Democrat.
He edited the Democrat until 1861, when he became a delegate to the Secession Convention, where he served as chairman of the committee that prepared the articles of secession.
With the outbreak of the Civil War he became a member of Brig. Gen. Benjamin McCulloch's staff; he advanced from private to major and published the War Bulletin from McCulloch's camp in Arkansas.
When the general was killed in 1862 Brown was transferred to the staff of Gen. Henry E. McCulloch, where he served as assistant adjutant general.
But poor health forced him in 1863 to rejoin his family, then in Austin.
During the remainder of the war Brown served with the Texas militia and commanded the Third Frontier District.
He participated with Col. John S. Ford in the last engagement of the war, the battle of Palmito Ranch, on May 13, 1865.
In June 1865 Brown and his family emigrated to Mexico, along with a number of other disaffected Southerners.
The Browns settled in the Tuxpan River valley, and Brown surveyed areas for settlement as assistant commissioner of immigration for the Mexican government of Maximilian.
In 1869 he visited Texas and the East on behalf of the Mexican government, and the next year he made a lecture tour of the northern states for the Evangelical Church in Mexico.
After a brief period in New Orleans the family returned to Texas to live in 1871; they finally settled in Dallas.
In 1872 Brown was again elected to the state legislature, and three years later he became a member of the state Constitutional Convention of 1875.
During the last fifteen years of his life he divided his time primarily between political duties and historical writing and editing.
In 1880–81 he served as the revising editor of the Encyclopedia of the New West.
In 1881 he was also appointed state commissioner for the surveying, marking, and locating of school lands.
He served as a Dallas alderman in 1884 and from 1885 to 1889 as the city's mayor.
From 1888 to 1890 he also held a post as justice of the peace.
Meanwhile, he found time to write and publish two historical books, The History of Dallas County, 1837–1887 (1887) and The Life and Times of Henry Smith (1887).
These were followed by his two most ambitious works, Indian Wars and Pioneers of Texas (ca. 1896) and The History of Texas from 1685 to 1892 (1892), both considered standards.
rown and his wife had five children, including a daughter, Marion Brown Taylor, who studied under San Antonio artist Julian Onderdonk and illustrated her father's History of Texas from 1685 to 1892 and her mother's A Condensed History of Texas for Schools (1895).
Brown died of a bronchial ailment on May 31, 1895, in Dallas.
His voluminous papers are preserved in the Barker Texas History Center, University of Texas at Austin.

First state Sängerfest held in New Braunfels
On this day in 1853, the first state Sängerfest, or singers' festival, began in New Braunfels.
After a successful Fourth of July celebration in 1853, the New Braunfels Germania male singing society invited similar organizations from Austin, San Antonio, and Sisterdale to a two-day festival held in New Braunfels on October 15 and 16, 1853.
Each group sang a cappella separately and joined together for works by Felix Mendelssohn and Heinrich Marschner.
At the second Sängerfest, held in San Antonio in May 1854, when the societies formed the Texas State Sängerbund (Deutsch-Texanischer Sängerbund or German Texan Singers' League), participation extended to singers from Coletoville, La Grange, Indianola, and Victoria.
Succeeding Sängerfeste were held in New Braunfels and Fredericksburg and brought added members or increased musical sophistication.
Despite interruptions caused by the Civil War and World War I, the Sängerfeste survived and continue to this day.
Wherever held, the festivals became the impetus for expanded musical activity on the purely local level, while they themselves ceased to be the sole property of the Germans as progressively more outsiders participated in the concerts and attended them.

Another chapter in Texas History
TEXAS STATE SÄNGERBUND.
The Texas State Sängerbund is an association of German singing societies.
After a successful Fourth of July celebration in 1853, the New Braunfels Germania male singing society invited similar organizations from Austin, San Antonio, and Sisterdale to a state Saengerfest (singers' festival), held in New Braunfels on October 15 and 16, 1853.
Each group sang a cappella separately and joined together for works by Felix Mendelssohn and Heinrich Marschner.
At the second Saengerfest, held in San Antonio in May 1854, when the societies formed the Texas State Sängerbund (Deutsch-Texanischer Sängerbund or German Texan Singers' League), participation extended to singers from Coletoville, La Grange, Indianola, and Victoria.
The next year's and each succeeding Saengerfest before the Civil War (New Braunfels, May 1855, October 1856, October 1858, and Fredericksburg, May 1859) brought added members or increased musical sophistication.
In 1860 the first participating mixed chorus (male and female) contributed excerpts from Franz Joseph Haydn's Creation.
The Civil War disrupted plans for an 1861 Saengerfest in Austin, for which orchestral participation had been planned, and the festivals did not begin again until September 1870 in San Antonio on a more modest scale.
There was a Saengerfest in New Braunfels in May 1873.
The festival in San Antonio in October 1874 was a milestone.
An orchestra of symphonic proportions, conducted by Professor Müller, participated in the public concert.
When San Antonio hosted the state festival again in 1877 because New Braunfels could no longer afford the burden, the city added an enlarged orchestra of nearly forty musicians under Emil Ludwig Zawadil.
Mixed choruses and massed choruses began to take some of the emphasis from individual singing societies, but each local group had an opportunity to sing at the banquet.
Not to be outdone, Austin imported the orchestra of the National Theater of New Orleans from St. Louis, Missouri, for the April 1879 Saengerfest.
With the addition of out-of-state musicians and non-Germanic politicians to speak, the festivals now became more oriented to the entire community rather than primarily to the German element.
When distant and wealthy Galveston invited the singing societies for a Saengerfest of two massive concerts in May 1881, the choruses of the New Braunfels-Fredericksburg area felt disfranchised and seceded from the state Sängerbund to found their own West-Texanischer Gebirgs-Sängerbund (West Texas Hill Country Singers' League), which has held modest but musically and socially satisfying festivals for more than a century.
While hosting the state festival in May 1883, Dallas added a third concert and an English-language chorus to the program for the first time and attracted audiences of up to 4,500 for the performances.
Later that same year the Houston Sängerbund was founded.
At that time the state festivals, held at two-year intervals, began to rotate between Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Galveston, and Dallas.
With minor variations this practice continued until 1916.
The number of concerts ranged up to five for each festival; choruses of school children began to participate; the massed male choruses and larger mixed choruses shared with the orchestra and imported soloists (often of world fame) the increasingly sophisticated content of the festival concerts, while individual male choruses were almost totally relegated to the jovial Kommerse.
Wherever held, the festivals became the impetus for expanded musical activity on the purely local level, while they themselves ceased to be the sole property of the Germans as progressively more outsiders participated in the concerts and attended them.
During World War I, the Saengerfest ceased when German Texans were suspected of "Hunnish" collaboration.
They began again in 1921 and continued on a modest scale resembling the social and musical meetings of the early 1870s: individual choruses from San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, and Houston; massed choruses; a band concert; and an evening dance to celebrate a rich German heritage in Texas.
Individual Sängerbunds continued to meet in cities throughout Texas in the twentieth century, and in many cases, benefitted from both non-German membership as well as new German immigrants who sought membership.
Saengerfests took place into the twenty-first century to carry on the German cultural traditions that had begun in the Lone Star State more than 150 years earlier.
GERMAN MUSIC.
The earliest reference to music among Texas German immigrants dates from 1834, when the elder Robert Justus Kleberg imported a piano and music books to Harrisburg.
In 1837 Mary Austin Holley enjoyed the informal singing of some Germans on a boat trip between Galveston and Houston.
Two years later German musical soirées were held at Kessler's Arcade in Houston, and in 1840 Emil Heerbrugger gave recitals on violin, horn, and guitar, with piano accompaniment, at the Capitol.
With colonization by the Adelsverein after 1844, German music began to flourish in Texas, and German musicians became more influential, even in the centers where the population was not primarily German.
Johann N. S. Menger was active in San Antonio as a piano teacher in 1847, and Franz Xavier Heilig became a music teacher for the city's public schools in 1853, to be joined later by Christoph Plagge and Henry Grossmann.
Likewise Joseph Petmecky, and later Udo Rhodius, J. Messner, and William Besserer taught in Austin, and other Germans taught in Houston, Galveston, Dallas, and other cities.
About 1879 Julius Weiss, from Saxony, went to Texarkana, where he taught a young student named Scott Joplin, destined to become "King of Ragtime."
Singing was among the earliest leisure activities, first with informal groups in Galveston, Houston, and New Braunfels in the mid-1840s, and then with formal male singing societies, including the San Antonio Männergesang-Verein (1847), New Braunfels Germania (1850), Austin Männerchor (1852), and Houston Männer-Gesangverein.
In 1853 the societies held a Saengerfest (singers' festival) in New Braunfels and formed the Texas State Sängerbund (singers' league).
Throughout the years other singers' leagues followed, such as the Houston Sängerbund, founded in 1883.
The German singing societies ultimately became the prime promoters of serious music in Texas before World War I.
Other leagues served their respective locales: the Hill Country, Gillespie County, Guadalupe Valley, and South Texas.
Singing societies existed at one time or another in roughly ninety Texas communities.
The oldest surviving singing society is the Beethoven Männerchor (San Antonio), founded in August 1865.
Mixed choruses were begun outside of church settings: the New Braunfels Concordia (1860), San Antonio Mendelssohn (1872), Houston Philharmonic Society (1872), and Austin Musical Union (1888), for instance.
These often signaled increased participation by non-German Texans and wider musical education throughout the community.
Opera arrived early in Texas in one form or another; Emil Heerbrugger's 1840 Houston recitals contained overtures and potpourris of popular operatic airs.
Musical immigrants brought opera scores and selections with them from Europe and often sang them around the family piano.
Frederic Law Olmstedqv heard excerpts from Mozart's Don Giovanni during a social gathering in Sisterdale in 1854, and operatic choruses were standard repertoire for singing societies before the Civil War.
Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freischütz (or extensive portions of it) was reputedly staged by the Casino Club in San Antonio in the late 1850s.
Dallas saw a complete local production of Friedrich von Flotow's Martha with piano accompaniment in 1868 and again, with orchestra, in 1875.
San Antonio opened its Grand Opera House in 1886 with Gaetano Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia, performed by the Emma Abbott Opera Company, and later witnessed Richard Wagner's Lohengrin in the same theater.
The final State Saengerfest (1916) before World War I included extensive selections from Wagner's Die Meistersinger, which was not performed whole in Texas until 1974.
Musical instruments among the Germans in early Texas were often of high quality: Heinrich Backofen, son of a prominent Darmstadt clarinet maker, brought "a whole chest" of instruments with him to Bettina in 1847.
A piano trio consisting of the violinist Listich, cellist Scheliche, and pianist C. D. Adolph Douai was active in San Antonio and New Braunfels in 1852–53.
Bands ranged from a single fiddler playing for dances in the 1840s to full concert ensembles by the 1880s and were often connected with the conductor's teaching activities, either in school or private studio.
The German band tradition survives today in the American Legion bands of Seguin and New Braunfels, as well as the Beethoven Concert Band of San Antonio.
In the 1870s the Germans were responsible for the first symphony orchestras in Texas.
The Texas German population included a number of composers.
Gottfried Joseph Petmecky (New Braunfels), Adolph Douai (San Antonio), Simon Menger (San Antonio), and C. Wilke (La Grange) all wrote works for male chorus in the 1850s.
The last also composed and arranged the music for Texas Fahrten, a song pageant written by Friedrich Hermann Seele.
Adolph Fuchs wrote and composed several songs in the 1840s and later.
Menger wrote a few piano pieces, as did Gabriel Katzenberger and John M. Steinfeldt in the 1880s and 1890s.
W. C. A. Thielepape of San Antonio left twenty-seven compositions dated from 1840 to 1899, and conductors Carl Venth and Arthur Claassenqqv were already noted composers when they arrived in Texas during the decade before World War I.
In Victoria, the Hauschild Music Company, owned by German descendant George Hermann Hauschildqv, established itself as one of the largest publishers of sheet music throughout the Southwest from 1891 to 1922.
Popular German folk music and dances, such as the polka and schottische, and the use of instruments such as the accordion, not only imparted the German musical influence to younger generations but also influenced other musicians who incorporated some of these sounds into their own musical styles (such as Texas-Mexican conjunto).
The long-term impact of German musical culture throughout Texas is also present through the numerous dance halls constructed across the state.
Some of these early community centers remained throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first as popular music venues for a variety of genres, from country to blues to Tejano to rock.qqv Gruene Hall, Anhalt Hall, Dessau Dance Hall, and Luckenbach Dance Hall are all examples of buildings constructed by German settlers in German communities.
For a time, World War I and World War II led to a decline in the open display of German customs and music.
Some dance halls closed, and singing societies and other music organizations folded.
During the latter part of the twentieth century, however, German Texans made efforts to preserve the history of their music.
Numerous festivals, including Wurstfest in New Braunfels, Oktoberfest in Fredericksburg, and Maifest in Brenham, paid homage to German music and dance, as Texas maintained its German music heritage into the twenty-first century.
NEW BRAUNFELS, TEXAS.
New Braunfels, the county seat of Comal County, is at the confluence of the Guadalupe and Comal rivers and the intersection of Interstate Highway 35 and Farm Road 725, thirty miles northeast of San Antonio and forty-five miles southwest of Austin near the southeastern border of the county.
It was founded on March 21, 1845, when, under the auspices of the Adelsverein, Nicolaus Zink led a German immigrant wagontrain up the Guadalupe River to the ford of the San Antonio-Nacogdoches road.
They made camp at a site on Comal Creek (now Dry Comal Creek) chosen by Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels, the first commissioner general of the Adelsverein, and promptly organized to receive later arrivals.
Zink platted preliminary town and farm lots and supervised construction of a primitive stockade, the Zinkenburg, to protect the immigrants against allegedly cannibalistic Indians.
Within weeks Prince Solms had laid the cornerstone for a more permanent fort and headquarters for the immigrant association, the Sophienburg (now the Sophienburg Museum), made provision for supplying the burgeoning settlement through its first summer on the frontier, and handed leadership of the colony over to John O. Meusebach.
By summer the settlers numbered between 300 and 400, and the community had been incorporated under the name of Prince Solms's estate on the Lahn River in western Germany, Braunfels.
From 1846 until the 1880s a number of Hispanics and Lipan Indians moved into New Braunfels each spring during sheep-shearing season.
Taking advantage of the reliable water power afforded by Comal Springs and the community's position on the road between Austin and San Antonio, the settlers wasted little time establishing the supply and processing businesses-stores, millworks, and craft shops-that soon made New Braunfels the commercial center of a growing agricultural area.
Many immigrants brought artisanal skills as well as business acumen to their new home.
Within a decade of its founding New Braunfels had emerged as a manufacturing center supplying wagons, farm implements, leather goods, furniture, and clothing for pioneers settling the hills of Central Texas.
The town also figured as an important market for the expanding agricultural frontier.
Its markets supplied places as close as Bastrop and Victoria and as far away as New Orleans, New York, and the Nassau province of Germany.
It is reported that in 1850 New Braunfels was the fourth largest town in Texas.
The community's social and cultural development proceeded with its economic progress.
Independent Evangelical Protestant, Lutheran, Methodist, and Catholic congregations were formed in the early years of settlement and undertook the construction of permanent church buildings.
Blacks formed Baptist and Methodist churches in the late 1860s.
The initial church school gave way to a city school, then to a district system that in 1858 was incorporated with the New Braunfels Academy.
Citizens voted unanimously to impose a tax for the support of a public school eighteen years before the Constitution of 1876 provided for such local taxation throughout Texas.
New Braunfels, Galveston, and Fredricksburg were among the first Texas towns to collect taxes to support schools.
Catholics established schools in the 1860s under the direction of the Sisters of Divine Providence; black schools were formed during Reconstruction, and schools for Hispanics appeared early in the twentieth century.
In the decades before 1990 the New Braunfels Independent School District supported five schools.
A gregarious lot, the Germans of New Braunfels also organized the Germania Singing Society, the Schuetzen Verein, a shooting club, and one of the early Turnvereinsqv or athletic clubs.
All of these served to maintain the ethnic and cultural identity of the original settlers for later generations.
The Neu Braunfelser Zeitung, which issued its first edition in 1852, was published continuously in German until 1957; it later merged with the English language newspaper, the New Braunfels Herald.
By the early 1880s, with a population estimated at 2,000, the community was linked by telegraph and rail lines with Austin and San Antonio, and textile factories along the Comal River were shipping cotton and woolen products.
The following decade saw the installation of electric streetlights and the first telephone line through New Braunfels.
A permanent county courthouse adjacent to the town square in New Braunfels opened in 1898.
By 1900 both the International-Great Northern and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas railroads provided freight and passenger service and had helped secure the city's future as a manufacturing and shipping center.
Flour mills, textile factories, and processing plants for construction materials provided the basis for steady growth in the twentieth century; from a population estimated at 3,165 in 1912 the town doubled in size to 6,242 by the onset of the Great Depression.
The depression and the boll weevil nearly devastated the textile industry, which returned very slowly.
A new growth period during and immediately after World War II saw the depression-era total nearly double again.
In 1952 New Braunfels had approximately 12,200 residents.
To keep pace with this growth and attendant social changes, New Braunfels reorganized its city government twice in the twentieth century, replacing the original aldermanic form in 1920 with the mayor-commission system, and subsequently replacing that with a council-manager form.
In 1947 the city incorporated eight suburbs within its limits.
In the twentieth century New Braunfels added tourism to its major industries.
The replacement of water and steam with electrical power in the late 1800s made land along the Comal and Guadalupe rivers within the city limits available for public use.
By 1936 the city had reserved much of this land for parks by purchasing Cypress Bend and Landa parks.
Landa Park had first opened in 1899 as a private resort area, and, promoted by the International-Great Northern Railroad, had begun to develop as a tourist destination for weekend excursions from San Antonio.
Tourism in New Braunfels accelerated in the decades following World War II, when Interstate Highway 35 was completed and when local merchants and investors began to capitalize on the natural and historic attractions offered by the city and its environs, particularly the recreational potential of the Guadalupe River and, after 1964, of Canyon Lake.
The opening of Natural Bridge Caverns and the Wurstfest, a German-heritage celebration, in the early 1960s also facilitated the growth of a tourist industry that by the mid-1980s supported some thirty hotels and motels, as well as resort condominiums, around the city and Canyon Lake.
Tourism combined with the continued vitality of the city's industrial sector to sustain a roughly 30 percent increase in the population of New Braunfels for several decades after World War II.
The city's proximity to San Antonio was another factor in its growth; in 1973 Comal County became part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area.
In the mid-1980s New Braunfels had fourteen major industries (each with more than seventy-five employees), with textile and construction-materials producers still predominant.
Seven major financial institutions fueled the growth.
In the 1970 census New Braunfels registered 17,859 residents; in 1980 it posted a gain to 22,402.
Hispanic-surnamed residents constituted 34.3 percent of the population and blacks 1.6 percent.
In 1990 New Braunfels had a population of 27,334 and extended into Guadalupe County.
The population grew to 36,494 in 2000.

   Washington, which declared Texas free from Mexico, were momentous in driving the Texas colonies to resistance.<span style=
   "mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> They had for years patiently borne with Mexican duplicity and intrigue.<span style=
   "mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> They recognized the supremacy of Mexican rule and law and were sincere in their desire to obey
   them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> As late as November, 1835, the Texans declared in convention that “they will continue
   faithful to the Mexican Government as long as that nation is governed by the constitution and laws that were formed for the government of the
   political associates.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> When Santa Anna and the other military chieftains overthrew the federal
   constitution of Mexico and dissolved the social compact which existed between Texas and other members of the Mexican Confederacy, the Texans
   declared that “they were no longer morally or politically bound by the compact of the union * * * yet they offered their support and
   assistance to such members of the Mexican Confederacy as will take up arms against military despotism.”</font></font></span></p>

   "mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For years the leaders among the colonists had
   advised patience and forbearance, hoping that a peaceful solution of the troubles arising could be reached without resorting to
   war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> But the intolerable exactions of the Mexican rulers finally swept aside every desire they
   had to remain a dependence of that country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> It was then they grew impatient and rose in
   revolt.</font></font></span></p>

   November, 1835, was the first time the colonists had publicly expressed a spirit of rebellion against Mexican despotism.<span style=
   "mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> And even then there were those among the delegates to this convention who were hopeful that a permanent
   separation from Mexico might be averted, and contented themselves by having the convention to declare that “they hold it to be right, during
   the disorganization of the Federal System and the reign of despotism, to withdraw from the Union and establish an independent government or
   adopt such measures as they may deem best calculated to protect their rights and liberties.”</font></font></span></p>

   convention believed it still possible to avoid a permanent separation from Mexico, a proposition to at once adopt a declaration of
   independence was voted down, and they organized a provisional State Government and elected a Governor, Lieutenant-Governor and Legislative
   Council.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> This was but carrying out the plan of 1833, to establish Texas as a separate State from
   Coahuila.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> The General Council was given power to call a convention with plenary
   powers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> This convention was called to meet at Old Washington, March 1, 1836.<span style=
   "mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> When it met it was clear that the hope for a settlement of the differences had forever dissipated and the
   convention was unanimous for a permanent separation and a declaration of the independence.</font></font></span></p>

   1833, the colonists held conventions in which they united in presenting to Santa Anna their grievances arising from the passage of laws and
   decrees during the brief reign of Bustamante.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Texas and Coahuila were consolidated into one state
   in 1827.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> This, the Texans claimed, was only a temporary arrangement, and in their convention in
   1833 they memorialized the Mexican government to give Texas a separate state government, setting out that the Constitution of 1824 guaranteed
   to Texas the right of having a state government whenever she may be in a condition to ask for the same, referring to the language of the
   Constitution which read: “As soon as Texas shall be in condition to figure as a state of itself, it shall inform Congress
   thereof.”</font></font></span></p>

   the Sate and elected Stephen F. Austin, Dr. John B. Miller and Erasmo Seguin, commissioners to present the memorial and constitution to the
   Government at the City of Mexico and ask for the ratification of the State constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> They
   were also instructed to request a modification of the decree prohibiting further immigration to Texas from the United States.<span style=
   "mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Austin was the only one of the Commissioners to go to the City of Mexico.<span style=
   "mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> He was unable to see Santa Anna, but he laid the memorial and Sate Constitution before Vice-president
   Farias.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> He succeeded in having the decree prohibiting further immigration from the United States
   modified, but failed to secure the ratification of the State Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Austin left the City
   of Mexico, December 10, 1834 and started back to Texas, but he was later arrested and thrown into prison.<span style=
   "mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Here he remained until the following July.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> In the meantime
   Santa Anna had overthrown the Constitutional Government of Mexico and declared himself dictator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>
   When Austin reached home he found the colonists organizing for defense, and recommended the calling of a general consultation to outline a
   course of procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> While this convention was in session the first battle of the Texas
   Revolution was fought near Gonzales.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> This battle was closely followed by the Texans driving
   General Cos and his troops out of San Antonio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Cos was a kinsman of Santa Anna, and when he
   learned of Cos’ defeat he fell into a rage and threatened revenge.</font></font></span></p>

   1830, when the Decree of Bustamante had startled the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> While this decree was objectionable

   alarm among the Texans, as it was violative of the Constitution of 1824 and was known to be aimed directly at the peace and quiet of the
   colonists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Soon after this infamous decree had reached Texas and its provisions became known, the
   Texans espoused the cause of Santa Anna who was leading a revolution against Bustamante.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> A
   convention was called to meet at San Felipe, October 1, 1832, for the purpose of enabling the colonists to present to the Mexican Government
   certain conditions which had greatly disturbed the quiet of the colonists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> The officers calling
   this convention had no thought of rebellion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> The object was to lay before Santa Anna their
   grievances against certain acts of a government he was struggling to overthrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> The Texans
   naturally imagined that this course would be pleasing to Santa Anna.</font></font></span></p>

<div align=justify>
<p><b><font size=+3>S</font></b>tephen Fuller Austin, founder of Anglo-American
Texas, son of Moses and Maria (Brown) Austin, was born at the lead mines
in southwestern Virginia on November 3, 1793. In 1798 Moses Austin moved
his family to other lead mines in southeastern Missouri and established
the town of Potosi in what is now Washington County. There Stephen grew
to the age of ten, when his father sent him to a school in Connecticut,
from which he returned westward and spent two years at Transylvania University
in Lexington, Kentucky. At Potosi, Moses Austin was engaged in the mining,
smelting, and manufacturing of lead and, in addition, conducted a general
store. After his return from Transylvania in the spring of 1810, Stephen
Austin was employed in the store and subsequently took over the management
of most of the lead business. He served the public as adjutant of a militia
battalion and for several years was a member of the Missouri territorial
legislature, in which he was influential in obtaining the charter for the
Bank of St. Louis. After failure of the Austin business in Missouri, he
investigated opportunities for a new start in Arkansas and engaged in land
speculation and mercantile activities. While he was there the territorial
governor appointed him circuit judge of the first judicial district of
Arkansas. He took the oath of office and qualified in July 1820, but he
only briefly held court, for at the end of August he was in Natchitoches,
Louisiana, and in December in New Orleans, where he had made arrangements
to live in the home of Joseph H. Hawkins and study law. At this time Moses
Austin was on his way to San Antonio to apply for a grant of land and permission
to settle 300 families in Texas.
<p>Though not enthusiastic about the Texas venture, Austin decided to cooperate
with his father. He arranged to obtain a loan from his friend Hawkins to
float the enterprise and was at Natchitoches expecting to accompany his
father to San Antonio when he learned of Moses Austin's death. He proceeded
to San Antonio, where he arrived in August 1821. Authorized by Governor
Antonio Mar&iacute;a Mart&iacute;nez to carry on the colonization enterprise
under his father's grant, Austin came to an understanding about certain
administrative procedures and was permitted by the governor to explore
the coastal plain between the San Antonio and Brazos rivers for the purpose
of selecting a site for the proposed colony. Among other details, he arranged
with Mart&iacute;nez to offer land to settlers in quantities of 640 acres
to the head of a family, 320 acres for his wife, 320 acres for each child,
and 80 acres for each slave. For such quantity as a colonist desired, Austin
might collect 12? cents an acre in compensation for his services. Mart&iacute;nez
warned Austin that the government was unprepared to extend administration
over the colonists and that Austin must be responsible for their good conduct.
<p>Austin returned to New Orleans, published these terms, and invited colonists,
saying that settlements would be located on the Brazos and Colorado rivers.
The long depression, followed by the panic of 1819 and changes in the land
system of the United States, made settlers eager to take advantage of the
offer, and the first colonists began to arrive in Texas by land and sea
in December 1821. To his great disappointment, Austin was informed by Governor
Mart&iacute;nez that the provisional government set up after Mexican independence
refused to approve the Spanish grant to Moses Austin, preferring to regulate
colonization by a general immigration law. Austin hastened to Mexico City
and, by unremitting attention, succeeded in getting Agust&iacute;n de Iturbide's
rump congress, the junta instituyente, to complete a law that the emperor
signed on January 3, 1823. It offered heads of families a league and a
labor of land (4,605 acres) and other inducements and provided for the
employment of agents, called empresarios, to promote immigration. For his
services, an empresario was to receive some 67,000 acres of land for each
200 families he introduced. Immigrants were not required to pay fees to
the government, a fact that shortly led some of them to deny Austin's right
to charge them for services performed at the rate of 12? cents an acre.
The law was annulled when Iturbide abdicated, but in April 1823 Austin
induced congress to grant him a contract to introduce 300 families in accordance
with its terms. In August 1824 a new congress passed an immigration law
that vested the administration of public land in the states, with certain
restrictions, and authorized them to make laws for settlement. In March
1825 the legislature of Coahuila and Texas passed a law conforming in general
to the previous act approved by Iturbide. It continued the empresario system
contemplated by that law and offered to each married man a league of land
(4,428 acres), for which he was obligated to pay the state thirty dollars
within six years. In the meantime, Austin had substantially fulfilled his
contract to settle the first 300 families. Under this state law, he obtained
three contracts (in 1825, 1827, and 1828) to settle a total of 900 additional
families in the area of his first colony, besides a contract in partnership
with his secretary, Samuel M. Williams, for the settlement of 800 families
in western Texas. Unfortunately, this partnership contract led to a disagreeable
controversy with Sterling C. Robertson.
<p>Austin had complete civil and military authority over his colonists
until 1828, subject to rather nominal supervision by the officials at San
Antonio and Monterrey. He wisely allowed them to elect militia officers
and local alcaldes, corresponding to justices of the peace in the United
States; and, to assure uniformity of court procedure, he drew up forms
and a simple civil and criminal code. As lieutenant colonel of militia,
he planned and sometimes led campaigns against Indians. When population
increased and appeals from decisions of individual alcaldes promised to
become a burden, he instituted an appellate court composed of all the alcaldes-ultimately
seven in number. The Constitution of Coahuila and Texas went into effect
in November 1827, and Austin seized the opportunity to relieve himself
of responsibility for the details of local government by hastening the
organization of the ayuntamiento, over which by virtue of experience he
continued to exercise strong influence in relations with the superior government
of the state. Aside from the primary business of inducing immigrants to
come to his colonies, Austin's most absorbing labor was devoted to the
establishment and maintenance of the land system. This involved surveying
and allocating land to applicants, with care to avoid overlapping and to
keep conflicts at a minimum. The Mexican practice of issuing titles on
loose sheets without a permanent record invited confusion, and Austin asked
and obtained permission to record titles in a bound volume having the validity
of the original. Both copies and originals had to be attested by the land
commissioner, who represented the government, but Austin and his secretary
had to prepare them.
  <p>The labor of directing surveyors, checking their field notes, allocating 
    grants, preparing titles and records, entertaining prospective colonists, 
    corresponding with state and federal officials, punishing hostile Indians, 
    and finding food and presents for friendly visitors to keep them from marauding 
    was heavy and expensive. To meet current costs, Austin's only resource was 
    to assess fees against the colonists. Though his original plan to collect 
    12? cents an acre for services rendered was originally welcomed by the first 
    settlers, some of them refused to pay after the imperial colonization law 
    proposed to compensate empresarios by grants of land. Ignoring the facts that 
    the empresario could not claim the grant until he had settled at least 200 
    families and that he could hardly sell land when every married man could obtain 
    4,600 acres free, the settlers appealed to the political chief at San Antonio 
    for an opinion, and he ruled that Austin could not collect. At the same time, 
    however, he proclaimed a fee bill, which among other details allowed the land 
    commissioner (the Baron de Bastrop in the first colony) to charge $127 a league 
    for signing titles, and Austin made a private arrangement with Bastrop to 
    split this fee. A rather veiled provision of the state law of 1825 allowed 
    empresarios to reimburse themselves for costs and services, and under this 
    law Austin required colonists to pay, or promise to pay, first sixty dollars 
    and later fifty dollars a league. Nearly all such collections as he was able 
    to make were consumed in necessary public expenses, which fell upon him because 
    nobody else would pay them. This statement applies, in fact, to all his colonizing 
    experience. Though his personal circumstances became somewhat easier with 
    the growth of the colonies, he wrote shortly before his death that his wealth 
    was prospective, consisting of the uncertain value of land acquired as compensation 
    for his services as empresario.<img SRC="/web/20160521180238im_/http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adp/resources/images/austincolony.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 height=234 width=351 align=LEFT>Besides 
    bringing the colonists to Texas, Austin strove to produce and maintain conditions 
    conducive to their prosperous development. This aim coincided, in general, 
    with that of the government. For example, by an act of September 1823, the 
    federal government relieved the colonists of the payment of tariff duties 
    for seven years; and the state legislature was nearly always reasonably cooperative. 
    Mexican sentiment sometimes clashed, however, with practical needs of the 
    colonists, and Austin had to evolve or accept a compromise. The status of 
    slavery was always a difficult problem, and Austin's attitude from time to 
    time seems inconsistent. With almost no free labor to be hired and expecting 
    most of the colonists to come from the slave states, Austin prevailed on the 
    junta instituyente to legalize slavery in the imperial colonization law, under 
    which the first colony was established. Contrary to his strenuous efforts, 
    the Constitution of Coahuila and Texas prohibited further introduction of 
    slaves by immigration, but the legislature passed a law at his suggestion 
    that evaded the intent of the constitution by legalizing labor contracts with 
    nominally emancipated slaves. He appeared to concur, however, when congress 
    prohibited immigration in 1830, and tried to convince the colonists that the 
    long-time interest of Texas would be served by the prohibition. He vividly 
    pictured the potential evils of slavery and was apparently sincere, but he 
    failed to reconcile the colonists to the law and after 1833 declared consistently 
    that Texas must be a slave state. Whatever his private convictions may have 
    been, it is evident that they yielded to what may have seemed to be the current 
    need of Texas. It is inferable, moreover, that his acceptance of federal and 
    state regulations against the extension of slavery contemplated continuation 
    of the evasive state labor law. 
  <p>Another subject in which the interests of the colonists were deeply
involved was their protection from efforts of creditors to collect debts
incurred by debtors before they moved to Texas. In view of conditions in
the United States during the 1820s, it was inevitable that many should
have left debts and unpaid judgments behind them. Working through the local
ayuntamiento, the political chief at San Antonio, and representatives in
the congress, or legislature, Austin secured a state law that closed the
courts for twelve years to plaintiffs seeking collection of such debts
and permanently exempted land, tools, and implements of industry from execution
if a suit was finally won. The law provided further that unsuccessful defendants
could not be required to pay produce or money in a way to "affect their
attention to their families, to their husbandry, or art they profess."
In effect, it was a sweeping homestead exemption law. For a while, in 1832,
Austin toyed with the idea of abolishing collateral security for loans
and basing "the credit system upon moral character alone...avoiding unjust
retroactive effects."
<p>Aware of the importance of external trade, Austin consistently urged
the establishment of ports and the temporary legalization of coasting trade
in foreign ships. In lengthy arguments to various officials, he declared
that the coasting trade would establish ties of mutual interest between
the colonists and Mexico and enable Mexico to balance imports from England
by exporting Texas cotton. Congress legalized the port of Galveston after
a survey of the pass by Austin in 1825, and the government winked at the
use of the Brazos and other landing places, but the coasting trade in foreign
vessels was not established. As a result, external trade was confined to
the United States. As early as 1829 and as late as 1835 Austin was giving
thought to diversion of the Missouri-Santa Fe trade to Texas, but this
was another far-sighted plan that could not be realized.
<p>Harmony with state and federal authorities was indispensable to the
success of the colonies. Austin clearly realized this fact and never allowed
the settlers to forget the solid benefits that they received through the
liberal colonization policy or their obligation to obey the laws and become
loyal Mexican citizens. He anticipated and disarmed criticism of inconvenient
laws and clumsy administration and then used the patience of the colonists
as evidence of good faith in begging the government for concessions. He
thwarted the efforts of Haden Edwards to drag his colonists into the Fredonian
Rebellion and led the militia from the Brazos and Colorado to assist Mexican
troops in putting it down. His settled policy before 1832 was to take no
part in Mexican party convulsions. "Play the turtle," he urged, "head and
feet within our own shells." Two factors finally defeated the policy of
aloofness. By 1832 Austin's various colonies comprised 8,000 persons, and
other empresarios, though less successful, had brought in a great many
more. Naturally, it became more and more difficult for Austin to reconcile
them to his cautious leadership. On the other hand, the rapid growth of
the colonies, in addition to persistent efforts of the United States to
buy Texas, increased the anxiety of Mexican leaders. Their consequent attempt
to safeguard the territory by stopping immigration-with other irritations-caused
an insurrection, and continued friction led to revolution and independence.
<p>The Law of April 6, 1830, embodied the Mexican policy of stopping the
further colonization of Texas by settlers from the United States. The law
proposed to annul general empresario contracts uncompleted or not begun
and prohibited settlement of immigrants in territory adjacent to their
native countries. In effect, it applied only to Texas and the United States.
By ingenious and somewhat tortuous interpretation, Austin secured the exemption
of his own colonies and the colony of Green DeWitt from the prohibition.
He thereby gained a loophole for continued immigration from the United
States and then turned industriously to the task of getting the law repealed.
He succeeded in this in December 1833.
<p>In the meantime, however, military measures to enforce the Law of April
6, 1830, and imprudent administration of the tariff laws, to which the
Texans became subject in September 1830, produced the Anahuac Disturbances.
Austin had been away from Texas for several months at Saltillo attending
a session of the legislature, of which he was a member. It is probable
that he could have averted the uprising, had he been at home. In fact the
local authorities, including Ram&oacute;n M&uacute;squiz, the political
chief, had quieted and repudiated it, when irresistible circumstances compelled
Austin to abandon his well-tried policy of aloofness from national political
struggles and adopt the cause of Antonio L&oacute;pez de Santa Anna against
the incumbent administration of President Anastasio Bustamante. Texas could
no longer stand aside. Fortuitously Santa Anna won, and the colonists could
not be diverted from claiming the reward of their valorous support.
<p>The Convention of 1832 met in October of that year to inform the government
of the needs of the Texans. They wanted repeal of the prohibition against
immigration from the United States, extension of tariff exemption, separation
from Coahuila, and authority to establish state government in Texas. For
reasons not entirely clear these petitions were not presented to the government.
Though Austin was president of the convention, he doubted the expediency
of the meeting, fearing that it would stimulate suspicion of the loyalty
of the colonists-all the more because the old Mexican inhabitants of San
Antonio had sent no delegates to the convention. It is easy to conclude
that Austin held out hope that he might persuade these local Mexicans to
take the lead in asking for reforms in a later convention; at any rate,
he was in San Antonio engaged on this mission when the ground was cut from
under his feet by publication of a call for a second convention to meet
at San Felipe on April 1, 1833. Again Austin acquiesced and served in the
convention, hoping in some measure to moderate its action. This Convention
of 1833 repeated the more important petitions of the previous meeting and
went further in framing a constitution to accompany the request for state
government. Though it was well known that Austin thought the movement ill-timed,
the convention elected him to deliver the petitions and argue for their
approval. Even men who distrusted him acknowledged his great influence
with state and federal authorities. He left San Felipe in April, arrived
in Mexico City in July, and, after unavoidable delays, persuaded the government
to repeal the Law of April 6, 1830, and to promise important reforms in
Texas local government. He started home in December, reasonably satisfied
with his work and convinced at least that he had left nothing undone; President
Santa Anna simply would not approve state government for Texas. Austin
was arrested at Saltillo in January, under suspicion of trying to incite
insurrection in Texas, and taken back to Mexico City. No charges were made
against him, no court would accept jurisdiction of his case, and he remained
a prisoner, shifting from prison to prison, until December 1834, when he
was released on bond and limited to the area of the Federal District. He
was freed by a general amnesty law in July 1835 and at the end of August
returned to Texas by way of New Orleans.
<p>Austin was thus absent from Texas for twenty-eight months. Upon his
return, he learned that an unofficial call had been issued for a convention,
or consultation, to meet in October. Probably he could have quashed this
call, but in a notable speech at Brazoria on September 8 he gave it his
sanction, and election of delegates proceeded. The Consultation organized
on November 3. In the meantime, during September and early October, Austin
had been in effect civil head of Anglo-American Texas, as chairman of a
central committee at San Felipe. War began at Gonzales on October 1. Austin
was elected to command the volunteers gathered there and led them against
the Mexican army at San Antonio. In November the provisional government
elected him to serve, with William H. Wharton and Branch T. Archer, as
commissioner to the United States. He arrived in New Orleans in January
1836 and returned again to Texas in June. The business of the commissioners
was to solicit loans and volunteers, arrange credits for munitions and
equipment, fit out warships, and do whatever they could to commit the government
of the United States to recognition and eventual annexation if Texas should
declare independence. They were fairly successful in accomplishing this
program, except in the effort to obtain assurances from President Andrew
Jackson and Congress. Austin was convinced, however, that Congress would
have voted for recognition in May, after the battle of San Jacinto, if
the acting president, David G. Burnet, had cooperated with the commissioners
by sending them official reports of conditions in Texas. Somewhat hesitantly,
Austin consented to offer himself for the presidency after his return to
Texas. He was defeated in the election of September 1836, but accepted
the office of secretary of state from the successful candidate. He died
in service on December 27, 1836, at the untimely age of forty-three.

<p>Judged by historical standards, Austin did a great work. He began the
Anglo-American colonization of Texas under conditions more difficult in
some respects than those that confronted founders of the English colonies
on the Atlantic coast. He saw the wilderness transformed into a relatively
advanced and populous state, and fundamentally it was his unremitting labor,
perseverance, foresight, and tactful management that brought that miracle
to pass. Contemporaries who disagreed with his cautious policy of conciliating
Mexican officials accused him of weakness and instability, but criticism
did not cause him to abandon it. Casually discussing this subject in a
letter of April 9, 1832, to his secretary, he wrote, "Some men in the world
hold the doctrine that it is degrading and corrupt to use policy in anything....There
is no degradation in prudence and a well tempered and well timed moderation."
Until the passage of the Law of April 6, 1830, attempting to shut out emigrants
from the United States, he believed that Texas could develop into a free
and prosperous Mexican state, a goal that he sincerely desired. Passage
of that law and continued political turmoil in Mexico certainly shook his
confidence, but prudence forbade abandonment of the policy of outward patience
and conciliation before Texas seemed strong enough to demand reforms and
back the demand by force. Premature action might be fatal, or so he thought.
He would have prevented the conventions of 1832 and 1833 if he could have
had his way, but, since he could not, he went along and tried to moderate
their demands. The same considerations caused him to oppose the Texas Declaration of Independence by the provisional government in 1835, while there was hope of winning the support of the liberal party in Mexico. In short, his
methods varied with circumstances, but from the abiding aim to promote
and safeguard the welfare of Texas he never wavered. As he wrote in July
1836, "The prosperity of Texas has been the object of my labors, the idol
of my existence-it has assumed the character of a religion, for the guidance
of my thoughts and actions, for fifteen years." Consciousness of heavy
responsibility dictated his policy of caution and moderation and compelled
him to shape his methods to shifting circumstances.</div>

The Sun THURSDAY, November 20, 1986 A9 CALIFORNIA Ex-prosecutor killed by arsonist harboring grudge investigator; arson investigator Fred DuPuis; and Nick Giampali, a private investigator and former San Rafael police investigator.
signed by Schlette, listed Weissich and four others involved in the arson case: Stinson; Charles Daniels, then a San Rafael insurance bored a grudge for 31 years and for some reason or other decided to murder Bill Weissich," Marin County District Attorney Jerry Herman said Wednesday. "
There's nothing we can do to anticipate against that deranged mind.
" Police said a search of Schlette's van turned up weapons, a gas mask, a rubber raft and other equipment that showed he could have been preparing to kidnap other people he felt had wronged him. "
Isn't it something that a person can harbor such hatred for so SAN RAFAEL (AP) A "deranged" arsonist who harbored a grudge for 31 years made good on his threat to kill the man who prosecuted him, then committed suicide as police closed in, apparently by taking poison, authorities said Wednesday.
Malcolm Roland Schlette, 72, forced a receptionist at gunpoint to escort him into the private law office of William 0.
Weissich, 66, Tuesday and shot him several times with a .45-caliber pistol equipped with a silencer and laser sight, authorities said.
"Here we have a man who har long?"
said former Marin County Undersheriff Sid Stinson, who investigated the 1955 arson case.
Police Detective Michael Keller said at a news conference a note found in Schlette's apartment in Santa Rosa read: "I declare as my final act on earth that I and I alone am responsible for all acts of violence I was able to perpetrate against my enemies. "
My regret is that society only gave me this avenue to square extraordinary wrongs committed against my branch of the Schlette family.

' - " .12 Carat Three Link Starter Bracelet Judge removes himself from McMartin case LOS ANGELES Superior Court Judge Roger Boren agreed to remove himself Wednesday as the trial judge in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case, and a new judge was chosen after two others were vetoed by attorneys.
Superior Court Judge William Pounders was assigned the case.
There was no immediate word on how long the change of judges might delay the scheduled Nov. 25 trial, or a Nov. 24 hearing on a defense motion to dismiss the case because of alleged prosecutorial misconduct.
Of the original seven defendants, only Raymond Buck-ey, 28, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 59, remain.
They face more than 100 child molestation and criminal conspiracy charges.
Both Buckey and his mother were present for Wednesday's court action.
Boren removed himself from the case Wednesday morning after defense attorney Dean Gits filed a peremptory challenge with the jurist.
LaRouche offices raided in probe LOS ANGELES The state attorney general's office raided offices of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche in two California cities Wednesday in its investigation of alleged improprieties in qualifying the AIDS initiative for the November ballot.
The raids were condemned by Jim Duree, a spokesman for PANIC, the Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee, as "a political witchhunt against Lyndon LaRouche and his associates.
" "What they are trying to do is harass us," said Khushro Ghandhi, PANIC president. "
Our members have been living under close harassment since October," when the U.S. attorney general's office raided the LaRouche offices in Lees-burg, Va.
Chief Assistant Attorney General Steve White said the raids, executing search warrants, were carried out in Liv-ermore and Los Angeles by agents of the attorney general's office and the district attorneys' offices of Alameda and Los Angeles counties.
Materials were seized from both offices, White said, but added he couldn't elaborate until an inventory of the items was completed.
The raids were part of the state's previously reported investigation into alleged improprieties into how signatures were gathered for the ballot measure, Proposition 64, which voters overwhelmingly.
Bouquet bomb suspect charged SAN FRANCISCO A man accused of delivering a booby-trapped bouquet to the estranged wife of his reputed homosexual lover was charged Wednesday in the bombing, which injured the woman and a co-worker.
Meanwhile, the injured woman's husband telephoned police and said he was flying back to San Francisco from his native West Germany, where he apparently had been for several days.
Shaun Jerome Small, 27, was arraigned on charges of attempting to damage or destroy a federal office with a bomb, possession of an unregistered explosive and construction of an unregistered explosive.
Authorities say the bombing apparently stemmed from a bitter divorce between Peter K. Pilaski, 52, and Melanie Pilaski, 41.
A source close to the investigation said neighbors and friends believed a homosexual relationship between the two men was behind the divorce.
Mrs. Pilaski's father, Willard O. Swanstrom, said he could not confirm published reports the men were lovers. "
Their goings-on were more or less private," he said.

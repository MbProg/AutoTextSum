About Us
The metro dailies don't cover Vashon's local news and have poor circulation on the Island. This is why almost everyone on the Island subscribes to The Beachcomber. If your business draws customers from Vashon, the most effective way to reach them is through the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber. Despite being only 15 minutes by ferry from Seattle, Vashon Island has maintained a separate identity, preserving a rural way of life that includes a vibrant local economy with no major retailers. Residents frequently travel to Seattle or Tacoma for shopping.

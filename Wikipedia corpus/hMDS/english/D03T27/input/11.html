<h2>Lyndon LaRouche: Man of Vision or Venom?</h2>

<h3>What's the Real Story?</h3>

<P>Supporters of Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. seem to be everywhere these days: on street corners, behind campus literature tables, outside post offices, at anti-war meetings and demonstrations.  Is the man behind the LaRouche Youth Movement a progressive mentor for young activists?  Is he really-as some of his supporters suggest-one of the world's greatest living economists and philosophers?  Is LaRouche, the perennial presidential candidate, an important leader in the Democratic Party? Or is Lyndon LaRouche a self-promoting demagogue surrounded by devoted followers who sanitize his long history of bigotry and crackpot statements, and dismiss his criminal conviction as the result of a vast conspiracy?</P>

<P>Twenty years ago these questions weren't necessary. Back then, a wide range of activists across the political spectrum readily denounced Lyndon LaRouche and his international network as a fascistic totalitarian group spreading lunatic political theories, monitoring progressive activists and providing the information to government agencies, and engaging in dubious fundraising schemes.<SUP><A HREF="#P5_1151" NAME="P5_1152">1</A></SUP></P>

<P>These days, browsers stopping by a LaRouche table at an anti-war rally may be unaware of his past, or the truth about his political views. LaRouchite publications critical of the Bush Administration, the neoconservatives, and the Iraq War can seem appealing to progressives. So let's review the LaRouche record.</P>

<h4>Sexism and Misogyny</h4>

<P>LaRouche has written about &quot;Mothers' Fears,&quot; the many psychological problems of activists allegedly caused by their moms. An early LaRouchite editorial declared that &quot;all across the U.S.A., there are workers who are prepared to fight. They are held back, most immediately, by pressure from their wives.&quot;<SUP> <A HREF="#P9_2383" NAME="P9_2384">2</A></SUP> Women in the LaRouche organization at the time report they were verbally attacked in long criticism sessions as &quot;witches,&quot; and &quot;sadistic bitches&quot; and were accused of &quot;mother-dominating&quot; the male members.<SUP> <A HREF="#P10_2739" NAME="P10_2740">3</A></SUP></P>

<P>One former member said she left the LaRouche group in disgust when told that women's feelings of degradation were because female sexual organs are near the anus, thus causing women to confuse sex with excretion.<SUP> <A HREF="#P12_3488" NAME="P12_3489">4</A></SUP></P>

<h4>Racism</h4>

<P>LaRouche and some of his followers spread racist ideas that range from the absurd-such as the claim that Black musicians did not invent Jazz<SUP><A HREF="#P15_3709" NAME="P15_3710">5</A></SUP>-to the crude, as in the question posed by LaRouche in one essay: &quot;Can we imagine anything much more viciously sadistic than the Black Ghetto mother?&quot;<SUP> <A HREF="#P16_4173" NAME="P16_4174">6</A></SUP> It's not just Blacks LaRouche has a problem with. He has dismissed rural Chinese culture as &quot;hideous muck&quot; with its people &quot;paralleling the behavioral stagnation of lower animal life.&quot;<SUP> <A HREF="#P17_4521" NAME="P17_4522">7</A></SUP> Elsewhere he dissed a group of Puerto Rican organizers as incompetent, which LaRouche asserted was tied to their being &quot;almost totally sexually impotent.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#P18_4844" NAME="P18_4845">8</A></SUP></P>

<P>While the cultural accomplishments of people of color have been routinely dismissed by LaRouche, he regularly celebrates Eurocentric icons. We all become civilized, according to the LaRouchites, by learning to sing along with Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven;<SUP> <A HREF="#P20_5259" NAME="P20_5260">9</A></SUP> reading the work of 17<SUP>th</SUP> century European scholars such as Leibniz;<SUP> <A HREF="#P21_5676" NAME="P21_5677">10</A></SUP>  and, surprise, studying the words of LaRouche.</P>

<h4>Homophobia<SUP><A HREF="#P23_5898" NAME="P23_5899">11</A></SUP></h4>

<P>LaRouche charged that the federal government allowed AIDS to spread because it didn't want to &quot;estrange the votes of a bunch of faggots and cocaine sniffers, the organized gay lobby, as it's called in the United States. (I don't know why they're `gay,' they're the most miserable creatures I ever saw!)&quot;<SUP> <A HREF="#P25_6430" NAME="P25_6431">12</A></SUP> LaRouche later suggested that history would not judge harshly those who beat gay people to death with baseball bats to stop the spread of AIDS.<SUP> <A HREF="#P26_6699" NAME="P26_6700">13</A></SUP> </P>

<P>A LaRouche network newspaper insert distributed in Illinois declared that &quot;as a category, gays and lesbians do not represent a valid voting constituency, and neither do prostitutes, drug pushers, child molesters, warlocks, witches, pornographers, or others who are morally equivalent.&quot;<SUP> <A HREF="#P28_7134" NAME="P28_7135">14</A></SUP></P>

<h4>Antisemitism &amp; Fascism</h4>

<P>While LaRouche's antisemitism is often veiled, he has written that Judaism is a kind of parasitic appendage to Christianity, that &quot;a selfsustaining Judaism never existed and never could exist,&quot; and that Jewish culture &quot;is merely the residue left to the Jewish home after everything saleable has been marketed&quot; to non-Jews.<SUP><A HREF="#P31_8109" NAME="P31_8110">15</A></SUP> In the mid-1970s, LaRouche began incorporating claims of a vast Jewish conspiracy into his writing and the LaRouchites began to forge ties with persons from right-wing racist and antisemitic groups.<SUP><A HREF="#P32_9144" NAME="P32_9145">16</A></SUP></P>

<P>Antisemitic conspiracy theories were a core element of Hitler's Nazi movement, and later, the Nazis encouraged homophobia-themes picked up by LaRouche and some of his followers. A top spokesperson of the Anti-Defamation League has said of LaRouche: &quot;He is a small-time Hitler, if I can put it that way, in that he regurgitates many little things that Hitler did but he does it in a somewhat ambivalent way, in a somewhat camouflaged way.&quot;<SUP> <A HREF="#P34_9986" NAME="P34_9987">17</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Dennis King, author of <I>Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism</I>, argues that often reporters avoid &quot;the terms `fascist,' and `neo-Nazi' which alone could adequately express [LaRouche's] aims and methods.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#P36_10580" NAME="P36_10581">18</A></SUP> Former U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, however, used the terms &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;neo-Nazi&quot; to warn of the danger posed by the LaRouche group.<SUP> <A HREF="#P37_11452" NAME="P37_11453">19</A></SUP></P>

<h4>Attacking Environmentalism</h4>

<P>Pro-LaRouche publications have been at the forefront of denying the reality of global warming<SUP><A HREF="#P40_12600" NAME="P40_12601">20</A></SUP> and have denounced Greenpeace and other ecology groups.<SUP> <A HREF="#P41_13427" NAME="P41_13428">21</A></SUP> One of the major planks of the LaRouche platform is the immediate construction of numerous nuclear power plants.<SUP> <A HREF="#P42_14399" NAME="P42_14400">22</A></SUP> </P>

<P>The LaRouchites have a long history of snooping on environmentalists and other progressive activists and groups, and providing biased and distorted information to the media and government law enforcement and intelligence agencies.<SUP><A HREF="#P44_15756" NAME="P44_15757">23</A></SUP></P>

<P>In fact, the industrious LaRouchites have run what is essentially a private international intelligence gathering operation for decades.<SUP><A HREF="#P46_17046" NAME="P46_17047">24</A></SUP> For a time, top LaRouche aides supplied information to Ronald Reagan's National Security Council.<SUP><A HREF="#P47_17151" NAME="P47_17152">25</A></SUP> They have falsely accused environmental activists (and civil liberties activists) of plotting terrorism.<SUP><A HREF="#P48_17354" NAME="P48_17355">26</A></SUP></P>

<h4>Thuggery</h4>

<P>During a five month campaign called &quot;Operation Mop-Up,&quot; some LaRouche supporters used fists and martial arts weapons to break up meetings and beat up LaRouche's opponents on the political Left in the 1970s. Many targets of LaRouchite thuggery were injured and some were even hospitalized. At the time, one progressive publication described the LaRouchites as &quot;Brownshirts of the Seventies&quot; because of the similarity of these attacks to those carried out by Hitler's &quot;Brownshirt&quot; thugs in the 1920s.<SUP><A HREF="#P51_19197" NAME="P51_19198">27</A></SUP></P>

<h4>Criminality</h4>

<P>LaRouche was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for federal conspiracy, mail fraud and tax law violations.<SUP><A HREF="#P54_20532" NAME="P54_20533">28</A></SUP> Six of LaRouche's aides and fundraisers also were convicted. Prosecutors argued that LaRouche &quot;oversaw a fund-raising effort in which loans were solicited with false assurances to lenders,&quot; according to the <I>Washington Post</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#P55_20959" NAME="P55_20960">29</A></SUP> </P>

<P>The jury also found that the defendants showed &quot;reckless disregard&quot; because they failed &quot;to mention the organization's already severe financial difficulties and that top LaRouche officials never intended to repay the loans.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#P57_21248" NAME="P57_21249">30</A></SUP> The <I>Post</I> added that nine of the lenders who testified, (&quot;most of them elderly women,&quot;) loaned a total of $661,300 to LaRouche's organizations, with only $10,000 being repaid &quot;at a time when LaRouche's group spent $4.2 million on real estate in Virginia,&quot; including improvements to LaRouche's &quot;200-acre Leesburg estate.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#P58_21575" NAME="P58_21576">31</A></SUP>  The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the conviction of LaRouche and his six associates, and LaRouche served 5 years in prison before being paroled in 1994.<SUP><A HREF="#P59_21991" NAME="P59_21992">32</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Scores of victims of LaRouchite financial misdeeds, however, told a different story to reporters across the country, revealing a pattern in which some fundraisers for the LaRouche group victimized the elderly (among others) through aggressive fundraising and dubious investment schemes, and failed to repay tens of millions of dollars in loans. Several told of buying LaRouchite publications with their credit card and then seeing huge unexpected charges on their monthly statement-charges that were difficult if not impossible to have removed. Some told of purchasing printed matter from LaRouchite literature tables and then finding themselves listed as making a campaign donation to LaRouche's Presidential committee. LaRouche campaign &quot;donations&quot; were submitted by the LaRouche group for federal Presidential campaign matching funds paid for with tax dollars.<SUP><A HREF="#P61_22982" NAME="P61_22983">33</A></SUP> </P>

<P>LaRouche claimed he had no knowledge of any of this. He also claimed that he had no income, although he lived in a huge mansion surrounded by armed guards, and regularly jetted around the globe. LaRouche also had no clue where his food or clothing came from...it just appeared, he claimed.<SUP><A HREF="#P63_24276" NAME="P63_24277">34</A></SUP> The LaRouchites insist that they were framed and railroaded and that the prosecution was as part of a decades-long politically-motivated international conspiracy involving government officials, numerous others, and a mass media brainwashing campaign.<SUP><A HREF="#P64_24691" NAME="P64_24692">35</A></SUP></P>

<h4>Crackpot Conspiracies</h4>

<P>Why is LaRouche considered a crank in some circles? Consider the following tidbits drawn from numerous similar statements over 30 years. </P>

<P>According to LaRouche, The Beatles (who &quot;had no genuine musical talent&quot;) were created by the &quot;British Psychological Warfare Division&quot; and promoted &quot;by agencies which are controlled by British intelligence.&quot;<SUP> <A HREF="#P68_25421" NAME="P68_25422">36</A></SUP> Furthermore, the Queen of England and the British royal family run the global drug trade.<SUP> <A HREF="#P69_25610" NAME="P69_25611">37</A></SUP> </P>

<P>LaRouche asks: &quot;Who is pushing the world toward war?&quot; It is &quot;the forces behind the World Wildlife Fund, the Club of Rome, and the heritage of H.G. Wells and the evil Bertrand Russell.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#P71_26349" NAME="P71_26350">38</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Having a hard time as a political activist? LaRouche has the cure! He is &quot;confident and capable of ending your political-and sexual-impotence; the two are interconnected aspects of the same problem....I am going to make you organizers...by taking your bedrooms away from you....I shall destroy your sense of safety....&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#P73_26774" NAME="P73_26775">39</A></SUP> </P>

<h4>Response</h4>

<P>It's not effective to simply dismiss the claims by the LaRouchites as outright lies; they will simply deny it, and anyway, most of the people who surround LaRouche really seem to believe the many myths about the man and his mission. What do you think? Check it out.</P>

<P>The next time you pass the LaRouchites, stop and spend some time examining the literature. You may notice that all the publications from the various related groups-LaRouche PAC, <I>New Federalist</I>, Schiller Institute, LaRouche Youth Movement, <I>Executive Intelligence Review</I>-revolve around the latest speech, article, or statement by a single individual: Lyndon LaRouche. Is this how truly democratic political and social movements are structured? Do effective grassroots activists need a guru to tell them what to think?</P>

<P>Whether you want to work for social and economic justice through the electoral system, seek more dramatic systemic change through radical political activism, or just want to speak out against the foreign or domestic policies of the Bush Administration, your commitment of time, energy, and moral outrage will be better served by walking past the LaRouchites toward a group that does not carry so much heavy baggage of bigotry.<SUP> <A HREF="#P78_28105" NAME="P78_28106">40</A></SUP></P>

  <P>&quot;One month before the Clamshell Alliance staged its massive Seabrook occupation, [representatives of the LaRouche group] met with New Hampshire State Police agents, and warned them the demonstration was a cover for a terrorist attack. Among the documents provided to the police was material from Information Digest, a right-wing blacklist newsletter produced by aides and consultants to the late Rep. Larry McDonald (D-GA), a John Birch Society member who often blasted progressive groups in the Congressional Record. These USLP-supplied documents were apparently the basis for then-New Hampshire Governor Thompson's statements that the Seabrook Demonstration was being planned by `terrorists.' In the New Hampshire Police's summary of the USLP material, the Labor Party representatives are repeatedly described as `well- informed' and the police investigators give total credence to the charges that the proposed demonstration was `nothing but a cover for terrorist activity.' The Seabrook demonstration included non-violent civil disobedience, but no acts of violence on the part of the demonstrators.&quot;</P></DIV>

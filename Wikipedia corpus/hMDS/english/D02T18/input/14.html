<b><font size="4">&quot;Original Intent&quot; Ten Standard Fire Fighting Orders</font></b></p>

<p>For several years I have presented what I call the �Original Intent Ten Orders�. Fellow
fire fighters have asked me to put the talk in writing. I hope that these orders will become 
your fire fighting foundation.

<p><b>First</b>. Throw
away the listing of the <b>Ten Orders</b> as written in today�s literature. The <b>Orders</b> as 
written will compromise your safety. The present listing was developed as a catchy way for you to 
memorize the <b>Orders.</b> It will not help you in real world terms to effectively implement 
them. For the <b>Orders</b> to make sense, you must understand the original intent of the 
engagement and disengagement process. The <b>Orders</b> are in fact your rules of engagement.

<p>The <b>Ten Standard Firefighting Orders</b> were developed
by a Task Force commissioned by Forest Service Chief Richard E. McArdle in 1957.
The task force reviewed the records of 16 tragedy fires that occurred
from 1937 to 1956. Yes, both the Blackwater Fire of 1937 on the Shoshone National Forest and the Mann Gulch Fire at the Gates of the Mountains in 1949 
contributed to the wisdom contained in the <b>Ten Orders</b>. The <b>Fire Fighting Orders</b> 
were based in part on the successful �<b>General Orders</b>� used by America�s armed forces.

<p>Through my 29 fire seasons as a Fire Guard, Hot Shot,
Smokejumper and FMO I have restructured only 2 of the orders to better fit the
concept of engage and disengage as I was taught early in my career. I feel that my 
change in the order structure further complements the original intent of the authors. 
Remember the orders are designed to move up and down in sequence in an engagement and
disengagement process. Understanding this concept should make sense to you through 
your personal, on the ground experience.
<ol>
  <li><b>Know what your FIRE is doing at all times</b>. This is the basic order that 
     all orders fall back on. This order frames your fire in three dimensions. 
     The reason why we all like to initial attack is because of the
     unknown. What is my fire doing? What is it burning in? Soon,
     the unknown becomes the known as we complete our size up.</li>
  <li><b>Base all actions on current and expected BEHAVIOR of the FIRE</b>. 
     Your fire moves through the fourth dimension of time and space. Once you have 
     fixed your fire through the size-up process, you must then begin to anticipate 
     its movements through time. Current and expected fire behavior will help you do this.
     Your fire is not static. It will constantly move and grow until it is controlled.</li>
  <li><b>Keep informed on FIRE WEATHER conditions and forecasts</b>. This is the second leg 
     of your prediction matrix. In the Rocky Mountains, weather will most often dictate where 
     and how your fire will move.</li>
  <li><b>Post a LOOKOUT when there is possible danger</b>. You are close to engaging the fire 
     with firefighters. But first you have to assure that your first three orders are not 
     compromised. A Lookout will be able to tell you <b>What Your Fire Is Doing.</b>
     The Lookout can also take weather readings to help you predict where the fire is going 
     to go.</li>
  <li><b>Have ESCAPE ROUTES for everyone and make sure they are known</b> (safety
     zones). This is your final order before firefighters can become engaged. If the fire 
     situation deteriorates, you can always disengage to this order until the situation 
     becomes clear to you.</li>
 <li><b>Be ALERT, keep CALM, THINK clearly and ACT decisively</b>. The final five orders 
     deal with people. You must first be clear and calm in your own mind before you can lead 
     others. If you are confused then disengage to order 5 until the situation is clear again.
  Remember that all of us no matter what our experience level will be confused and unsure 
     of ourselves at times on the line. There are often just too many variables
     changing too fast for our minds to process. If you are confused, then disengage to your 
     safety zone to watch and learn.</li>
 <li><b>Maintain CONTROL of your men at all times</b>. Now you are moving out of your own 
     presence and out to others. This order goes directly back to Wagner
     Dodge and his smokejumpers at Mann Gulch. If the crew would have only listened to their 
     foreman and his revelation about an escape fire we might not have those 13 stations of the
     cross. All of us have doubts and uncertainties. The leadership on the fire must understand 
     the situation and make sure that it is communicated in a calm and orderly manner. </li>
 <li><b>Give clear INSTRUCTIONS and be sure they are understood</b>. If your crew is unsure, 
     then take the time to re-evaluate and bring everyone up to speed. When in doubt, ask your 
     firefighters to repeat the instructions until you are all on the same page.</li>
 <li><b>Maintain prompt COMMUNICATION with your men, your boss, and adjoining forces</b>. 
     Good communications are a sign of maturity. I have reviewed dispatch
     check-in and destination procedures with my high school daughter. I have had limited success. 
     As professional firefighters we must demand nothing less then the best possible communication. 
     If your communication lines are broken, then start the disengagement process until the lines 
     are open again.</li>
 <li><b>Fight fire aggressively but provide for SAFETY first</b>. I want to fight fire aggressively.
     I want to see the dirt fly. I want to move my crew around the fire�s head and cut the fire off. But, I know through experience that before I can fully engage, I
     must first satisfy the <b>Ten Orders</b>. If a safety problem arises at this point of 
     engagement, then I must start the disengagement process. Safety is written all over and 
     through the <b>Ten Orders</b>. I believe that the tenth order was written to emphasize the 
     disengagement and not the engagement process. Even when things are going great (your crew 
     is engaged and the dirt is flying), be ready to disengage back through the orders.</li>
</ol>

It is my hope that the Ten Standard Orders will be used as they were intended and not become 
just a list of items to be memorized by our field firefighters. I am not a saint. In my early 
years, I would tend to rush through the orders so I could aggressively engage. However, age 
and experience does change us all. I now submit, that the <b>Ten Standard Fire Fighting Orders</b> 
are the basic building block of our fire culture. All other fire suppression policy is based
on these <b>Orders</b>.

<p>I hope each firefighter will commit them to their heart, mind and soul. Be safe out there. 
This looks like a repeat of the �Fire Season from Hell�.

<p align="center">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p><i><b>Historical note:</b></i><p>
Like most of my articles and poems (on fire) I provide circulation first in <i>
The Smokejumper</i> (originally <i>The Static Line</i>). The &quot;Orders&quot; were 
published in the October 2001 Issue. </p>
<p>The Forest Service at first gave no support to the idea, until Hutch Brown at
<i>Fire Management Today</i> said &quot;this is good - lets get it published in a 
more official format&quot;.&nbsp; I could also count on the smokejumper brotherhood to get 
the ball rolling.&nbsp; A fellow jumper alumnus (Mike Apicello) pushed my write up 
from <i>The Smokejumper</i> at high levels. Mike was steadfast and pushed hard.&nbsp; 
I understand he gave copies of the article to anyone and everyone he could get 
to listen to him.&nbsp;If I remember right, the Interior Department Agencies (USNPS/BLM/USFWS) 
were very supportive. We also mailed copies through the computer system to 
anyone and everyone who would listen. </p>
<p>I had always taught our young firefighters the process I laid out in the 
article.&nbsp; The first publication (<i>The Smokejumper</i>) was the start in 
getting the orders back to their original format of what I believed to be an 
engagement - disengagement process. I also shared the article with Paul Gleason 
who was very supportive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The <i>Fire Mgt Today</i> publication (at a later date) was edited to be more 
friendly in nature.&nbsp; Attached is my original write up as sent to <i>The 
Smokejumper</i>. <i>(<a target="_blank" href="/web/20160409193134/http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/2003_n_before/10fireorders.htm">This 
Smokejumper version from 2001</a> is what we have here in the Archives. Ab.)</i></p>

ENGLEWOOD FIRE DEPARTMENT
After more than a century of service, the City of Englewood disbanded its fire department on June 1, 2015 and turned operations over to the Denver Fire Department on a contract basis. If all goes well, the contract will save Englewood millions of dollars. Two of Englewood's three fire stations remain open, served by newly organized Engine 37 and Truck 38 of the Denver Fire Department. Paramedic service is provided by Denver Health. Forty Englewood firefighters were hired by the Denver Fire Department and will serve throughout Denver.

On the night of Nov. 30, 1934, Fire Lt. John Kessels and his crew from Engine Co. 2 were advancing a hose through dense smoke on the third floor of Midwest Trunk & Bag Co. in Denver, Colorado.
"We were playing a line directly on the flames and thought we were getting along pretty good," Kessels told The Denver Post.
In an alley along the east side of the building, Assistant Fire Chief Andrew Mahon shouted orders.
Then ...
A wall collapsed, pinning Mahon to the wall of an adjacent building, trapping Kessel beneath a timber support and burying others in brick and mortar.
A dozen men down.
...
The Midwest Trunk & Bag Co. building was located at 1524-1526 15th St. at Wazee Street in the warehouse district.
It was constructed of hand-pressed brick three decades earlier with timber supports.
It had been considered "one of the finest buildings in lower Denver," according to The Rocky Mountain News.
At 8:34 p.m., the first alarm was turned in by a nightwatchman who discovered flames in the rear of the structure.
Crews thought they had the fire under control soon thereafter when a whoosh of air sent flames rocketing up an elevator shaft 75 feet into the night sky.
Denver Fire Chief John Healy ordered a second alarm - "2-11 signal" - transmitted over the fire alarm telegraph system, bringing more men and more equipment from distant parts of the city.
...
Assistant Chief Mahon, 47, immigrated from Ireland as a young man and served as a member of the Denver Fire Department for 28 years.
On the night of the fire, he was assigned to South Denver and "covered in" on the "2-11" with his driver, Joseph Murray.
In the alley where Mahon took position, men climbed a 50-foot ladder.
On the roof, Lieutenant H.M. Klein and 10 others went about their work.
Engine 2's Kessel and his crew held the third floor.
Others covered the second.
Firemen Roxie Pomponio and Clinton Turnbull had the first.
More prowled the alley.
"Chief Mahon saw the wall was giving in and yelled for all the firemen to get out of the building and out of the path of the wall," Fireman John Treckman told the Post. "Just as he hollered there was a terrific crash.
"I saw the debris coming down and jumped into a doorway for protection," Treckman said. "I saw Chief Mahon was caught in the debris. I saw his legs sticking out from a pile of bricks."
...
R.L. Wynkoop, an employee of Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph, was about a half a block away when the wall came down and ran for the nearest phone.
"I saw a tangle of men, debris and bricks and I knew some of the men must be badly hurt," Wynkoop told the News.
He asked the police operator to "send all the ambulances you've got to 15th and Wazee. Get them there in a hurry. A lot of firemen have been hurt by a falling wall."
In 1934, fire apparatus had yet to be equipped with two-way radios.
...
Captain William Carlin of Rescue Squad 2 instinctively took charge to save the fallen firemen.
Firemen Frank Piper, O.D. Wilson and J.J. Johnson were the first to reach Mahon.
George Reynolds and Harry Moore of Rescue Squad 2 followed.
The men lifted a heavy window frame pinning Mahon to a wall.
The 50-foot ladder near Mahon snapped and those scaling it "clung dizzily in mid-air," the Post reported.
On the roof, Lieutenant Klein shouted "let's get out of here" and directed his men to ladders that remained intact.
On the third floor, a crew lifted the timber pinning Lieutenant Kessels while Fireman Ted Webber pulled him loose.
From the first floor, Pomponio and Turnbull dropped into the basement, remarkably without injury.
...
Mahon was taken to Denver General Hospital where he died the next day at 4:20 a.m.
He suffered internal injuries, a fractured left leg, a fractured left arm and spinal injuries.
On its front page of its Dec. 1 edition, the Post printed a photo of Mahon sprawled on the ground, attended to by a civilian.
Engine Company 6 suffered the most casualties: William Behrman, Eugene Sullivan, Herbert Jacobson and Captain Harry Wood.
Doctors feared Behrman and Sullivan might not survive, but they did with Sullivan receiving a blood transfusion from Fireman Frank Neujahr, one of about 20 men who offered to act as donors.
Engine 2 suffered three casualties: Kessels, Londi Ross and Ralph Paul, both of whom were advancing the hose line with Kessels.
Engine 1 suffered two casualties: John Dempsey and Charles Jones.
Squad 4's John Doherty was also injured as was Peter Golesh, driver for Assistant Chief Guy Walker.
Others suffered cuts and bruises but refused treatment.
...
For a time it seemed the fire, which started in an overheated coal stove, claimed the life of Mahon's driver, Fireman Joseph Murray, as he was nowhere to be found.
He turned up at a firehouse later that night, having been dispatched from the blaze to pick up another assistant chief.
Engine 12 never made it to the fire from its quarters at West 26th Street and Federal Boulevard.
It was struck by a locomotive at a crossing on 15th Street.
None of its men were hurt but the front of the rig was demolished.
A police radio car responding to the fire was also in a wreck with another automobile.
...
With his head bandaged and right leg splinted, Lieutenant Kessels of Engine 2 bummed a cigarette and telephoned his wife from a ward at Denver General Hospital.
According to the Post, Kessels told her:
"You'll hear about a bunch of us getting hurt at this fire. Don't worry about me. I got a little scratch on my eye. I'm alright."
 
POST-WAR HOTEL FIRES
 
 Evacuation at LaSalle Hotel fire in Chicago
 
In the years following World War Two, the U.S. hotel industry suffered a spate of deadly fires, with three of the worst striking in 1946 -- Canfield Hotel in Dubuque, Iowa, 19 dead; LaSalle Hotel in Chicago, 61 dead; Winecoff Hotel in Atlanta, 119 dead.
Hotels of that era were plagued by a lack of maintenance and investment owing to the Great Depression and shortages of building supplies and other material during the war.
Many hotels were serviced by open stairwells, allowing for the swift spread of smoke and flame. Buildings lacked sprinklers and adequate fire exits. Open transoms over guest room doors were common as were varnished hallways and lobbies.
In the Rocky Mountain region, a fire at the Jackson Hotel in Laramie, Wyoming, claimed six lives on March 15, 1955.
Residents were forced to escape through windows - or jump.
Survivor Alfred Warner said: "The stairs were a sheet of flame. I climbed out the window and hung onto the hotel sign."
The hotel was built in the early 1900s and occupied the second floor of a two-story brick building.
Laramie Fire Chief Blake Fanning said there were about 25-30 people in the hotel and that the blaze apparently started in the lobby.
(Among the dead was retired rodeo rider Ed "Boots" Smith, who toured Europe in the early 1900s as a member of the Buffalo Bill Cody and Gandy Brothers Wild West shows.)
Additionally:
On Aug. 26, 1950, three people died and six were injured in a hotel fire on Denver's Market Street
On April 10, 1974, fire killed three people at the three-story Lewiston Hotel, a refuge for transients in downtown Denver. About a dozen other were injured. The hotel's fire doors were "blocked open."
 
MOFFAT TUNNEL - 1943 
Photo: Denver Fire Dept.
On Sept. 20, 1943, three members of the Denver Fire Department died in a fire in Tunnel No. 10 of the Moffat Tunnel Rail Line, near Rollinsville, Colorado.
Following is from Sept. 21, 1943, edition of Denver Post:
THREE DENVER FIREMEN KILLED BATTLING RAIL TUNNEL BLAZE
Meet Death in Bore on  Moffat Road, Probably from Suffocation; Body of Only One is Recovered
Three Denver city firemen died  Monday night fighting a fire in the timbered walls of a 1600 foot Denver and  Salt Lake railroad tunnel, twenty-seven miles northwest of Denver.
The dead,  according to Fire Chief Healy, are Douglas Vernon Parrish, 49, of 340 Clarkson  street, machinist in the fire department shops; James Williams, 37, of 1209 East  Colfax avenue, Chief Healy's driver, and John Kennedy, 34, of 665 Lafayette  street. All were married and two were fathers.
Parrish's body was recovered  just inside the east portal of the tunnel, but fire department officials said it  is unlikely any trace ever will be found of the other two men.
TUNNEL  STILL ROARING FURNACE.
At noon Tuesday the tunnel was still a roaring  furnace, filled with poisonous flumes. A pumper truck the Denver men had  accompanied to the scene was pouring a stream of water in the east end, and a  locomotive was doing the same at the west end.
Men still could not approach the  entrances.
Fire Capt. William R. Parry in command of the Denver men and  pumper, was saved only by accident, because his gas mask was working improperly  and he left the tunnel to get another. The pumper, one of Denver's newest, was  loaded on a flatcar and taken to the scene with its crew in response to a call  for help about 6:30 p.m. There is no road highway near the tunnel. When the  report of the disaster was received, Chief Healy sent rescue squad No. 4, under  Capt. Wilfred Lindsay, to the scene. The squad truck left the city at 1:25 a.m.  These firemen worked over Parrish about two hours without success.
Fred W.  Warner, superintendent of equipment for the fire department, who was sent to the  tunnel Tuesday morning, returned at noon to report to Chief Healy.
"Parry  went with Williams and Kennedy about 600 to 700 feet into the tunnel to fight  the fire," Warner said. "They had their gas masks on; Parry's wasn't working  right, so he came out." That's all that saved his life! Apparently a short time  after he left his companions, carbon monoxide gas formed, possibly from creosote  on the burning ties and timbers.
A stiff wind had been blowing from the east  into the tunnel mouth. It suddenly veered, creating the hazard most feared by  firemen—a back draft.
The gas and back draft combined to make a death trap  for Kennedy and Williams. Their masks were ineffective against monoxide, but  even if they became conscious of the gas and tried to flee, they possibly were  trapped by falling timber.
Parrish working at the pumper, became alarmed when  the men had not returned in ten minutes, Warner stated. Seizing a gas mask, he  entered the tunnel.
ROAD MASTER FINDS BODY.
A. L. Johnson, general  superintendent of the D. & S.L., said G. E. Hamilton, the roadmaster, then  took a mask and went in search of Parrish. He stumbled over Parrish's body about  100 feet inside. Hamilton was losing consciousness trying to drag out Parrish,  when he was rescued by other railroad men.

DENVER FIREMEN STEP UP TO HELP BROTHER
On Dec. 21, 1929, Denver fireman Elmer Hargis of Engine 15 lay ill in St. Anthony's Hospital in need of a blood transfusion. District Chief P.J. Boyne asked for donors. This was a risky procedure at the time. Firemen Ben Miller, James Williams, Joe Bernstein, Thomas Seely, Dan Nash and Ray Warne were chosen as candidates. Seely was deemed best match. "From those who volunteered I chose every type of man," Boyne said. "I chose a large one, a small one, a fat one, a thin one. There is no religion, no race in an emergency likes this."

CASANOVA NIGHT CLUB
 
On May 20, 1935, fire broke out at the Casanova, night club of the famous Brown Palace Hotel in downtown Denver.
 
"Flimsy draperies and hanging decorations in the Casanova went up like tinder, pouring smoke and gas fumes through the hotel," the United Press reported. "Some of the guests rushed to the windows and threatened to jump. Firemen produced nets, but prevented any from jumping by calling to them to remain in their rooms."
 
Several guests were carried down ladders by firemen.

The Casanova, itself, was demolished along with musical instruments belonging to the "Husk O'Hare Orchestra."
 
Fire Chief John Healy said the fire was caused by "an explosion of gas fumes."

HEROES ALL
1895 HOTEL FIRE TRAGEDY
Fire captain and three of his men lost in Denver blaze
'Blind fire' at St. James Hotel on Curtis Street
Editor's Note: On March, 23, 1895, four members of the Denver Fire Department’s Hose Co. 3 died when a fire at the St. James Hotel caused the lobby floor to collapse. They were: Capt. Harold Hartwell, Frederick Brawley, Richard Dandridge and Stephen Martin. With the exception of their captain, Hose 3's firemen were African-American. At the time, the Denver Fire Department, like many other U.S. fire departments, was segregated.
By Jerry Michals
Denver Fire Deprtment (retired)
Assistant Chief Alonzo Bates paid a visit to Hose #3 on Saturday evening March 23, 1895 and its crew: Captain Hal Hartwell, Lt. Fred Brawley, Pipeman Richard Dandridge and Pipeman Stephen Martin.
Driver William M. Walton was on his day off.  
At 10:40 p.m., an alarm from Box 7 came in on the gong for 15th and Curtis.
Chief Bates telephoned Fire Alarm and confirmed that it was the St. James Hotel, 1524 Curtis St.
They performed a quick hitch and as the second alarm was sounding, Pipeman Dandridge drove Chief Bates and followed Hose #3 to the working fire.
An Officer at the fire would have tapped in the 2nd Alarm from a Street Box.
The closest they could park the hose wagon was 16th and Arapahoe Sts. where they joined Chief Bates and Richard Dandridge.
They unhitched and tethered the horses with another company’s driver and the crew raced to the fire.
Horses were always unhitched and tethered to prevent runaways with the apparatus. 
The main St. James Hotel was a difficult fire to fight was that is was the old 1872 hotel that had a five-story addition built in 1881 and remodeled in 1887.
These additions and remodeling over the years created a maze in the basement and a difficult lobby to navigate.
Either faulty wiring or spontaneous combustion was the apparent fire cause.
The wiring was in poor condition due to the many changes made over time and had been an ongoing problem.
Chief Bates was given command of the Curtis St. entrance by Chief Roberts, who was in command at the rear of the building ordering Steamer #5 and Steamer #8 to focus their streams into the basement stairways and the elevator shaft at the rear of the building to keep the fire from spreading to the upper floors, thus losing the building.
Steamer #4 and Steamer #1 were at the front of the building.
The basement fire generated a large volume of heat and smoke that reached the upper floors through the elevator shaft.
Firemen did not have breathing equipment at this time and would use a wet piece of natural sponge to keep their airways cooled, breathing through clenched teeth and refreshing the sponge at the closest hose nozzle whenever possible. 
Chief Bates directed Hose #3 to take two lines off Steamer #4 through the front door across the lobby to the basement stairway and elevator at the opposite side of the rotunda or find any fire that was breaking through from the basement.
Two men on a line was too much to handle, so Captain Hartwell ordered one line to be given to Ladder #2, firemen from his first firehouse.
Visibility was zero.
Ladder #2 and Steamer #4 were on the opposite side of the lobby.
Five minutes after 11 PM Captain Hartwell and Pipeman Steve Martin were on the nozzle with Lt. Brawley and Steve Dandridge pulling line straight into the rotunda.
This is why a firefighters’ job description was “smoke eater”.
They were on their knees in the dense smoke and heat and paused to wet their sponges.
A tongue of flame from the rear appeared dimly through the smoke to guide them on.
They were now crawling slowly over the tile floor, no voices could be heard when the sound of breaking pottery and a loud crash was heard, followed by intense heat and smoke banking down from the ceiling.
No one heard a scream or yell as the four firemen of Hose #3 fell into the basement fire.
Ladder #2 directed their stream downward and assumed Hose #3 was doing the same.
Hose #3’s line was still flowing water.
Every newspaper had different accounts of other fireman being rescued from falling in the hole.
Firemen also rescued a woman trapped on an upper fire escape.
Just prior to the collapse, Chief Bates saw the hose lines moving and reported their progress to Chief Roberts.
There were five hose lines at the rear of the building and four at the front. Twenty-five minutes after the collapse, crews had knocked the fire.
The collapse provided access the seat of the fire, which was quickly extinguished by basement and 1st floor hose lines; the total time was one hour to save the building.
Chief Roberts and Chief Bates began searching for Hose #3 when they determined that there had been no contact from them. 
Crawling while following the line through the clearing smoke they found the gaping hole in the floor.
They ordered crews to the basement for a search that found the charred bodies of Hose Company #3.
The only portable lighting was the dim glow of kerosene lanterns.
It was determined that the fire had burned some time before the alarm was given thus allowing enough time to weaken the floor joists and support timbers.
NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT OF ST. JAMES HOTEL FIRE
The Weekly Pioneer Press of Akron, Colorado, described the blaze as:
“A blind fire -- that is a fire where the flames are not discernible and where the flames themselves are of little account, but where the smoke is most dangerous."“The actual fire did not reach above the basement” however, “it burned away the supports of the floor." 
Firemen “stayed the flames, but not so with the smoke" as "it penetrated the whole building."
“It could be seen belching from the doors on the ground floor and the windows up to the fourth story."
“The fumes caused by the cellar damp and the burning of the wood made it appear as if the whole building was ready to belch fourth in flames, while as a matter of fact the fire was confined to the walls and partitions in the basement of the building."
“The firemen who lost their lives groped their way through the smoke into the main entrance of the hotel, where the floor had been weakened by the fire."
“The result was that they went down into the smoky vortex below with no chance to save themselves or to be saved.”

PUEBLO INFERNO
On Aug. 29, 1953, flames devoured the Central Block in Pueblo, Colorado.
O.G. Pope, 88, an attorney who had an office and apartment in the building, was the sole fatality.
As the building crumbled, "We started running fast. Don't know where, just fast," said C.C. Wood, a Pueblo fire captain.
According to the Pueblo Fire Museum, flames broke out at the Standard Paint and Glass Co. and spread to other businesses.
 
DENVER: Flames Whip Garden Hose
  
From Fire and Water Engineering, Aug. 9, 1922 edition
 
A fire which threatened heavy loss in Denver, Col., occurred on June 21 in the plant of the Western Laundry Company in the central part of the city, according to Chief John F. Healy, of the fire department.
The fire was going through the roof and the building was entirely involved when the department arrived at 6:08 p.m. in response to a box alarm.
This was owing to the fact that the night watchman lost fully a half an hour in attempting to fight the fire himself with the aid of a garden hose.
By the time he realized that he could not extinguish the fire the entire building was in flames.
He then called the fire department.
 
MONTANA
Three firefighters died battling a blaze at the Ormesher Store and Moose Lodge in Missoula, Montana, on Dec. 30, 1951. The fire had been burning for several hours. It flared up at about dusk and a wall collapsed, burying the men - Bernard J. Albright, Walter E. Cain, and Edward Sayler.
 
WYOMING: Roof Ablaze
On Aug. 5, 1980, an electrical fault in a transformer atop the Wort Hotel in Jackson, Wyoming, ignited a bird nest and the flames spread.
The fire burned into the night and the roof collapsed.
Just days later, a sign went up saying: "We will be back."
The hotel reopened in June 1981.

 TURKEY SHOOT
ROCK SPRINGS, Wyo., Dec. 15 (AP) - Firemen rushed into J. H. Cox's blazing shooting gallery, only to rush right out again. Eleven ducks and seventeen turkeys intended as prizes to marksmen protested loudly as they roasted, but the firemen were busy dodging 4,000 rounds of exploding rifle ammunition.

'MILLIONAIRE'
FIRE CHIEF OF CHEYENNE
Percy Hoyt
From Fire Service magazine Jan. 28, 1922 edition
The resignation of Percy Hoyt as chief of the Cheyenne, Wyo., Auxiliary Volunteer Fire department, an organization of fire-fighting veterans called upon to aid the paid city department in time of emergency has been delivered to Mayor Taylor and the auxiliary department is to be disbanded.
Whether it will be replaced by a similar new organization of volunteers has not been decided.
Chief Hoyt, a wealthy clubman whose hobby is fire fighting, has been chief of the auxiliary since its organization 13 years ago, when the old volunteer department was disbanded.
Chief Hoyt was a conspicuous figure at the annual conventions of the International Association of Fire Engineers.
He was in the habit of wearing a cowboy’s sombrero with a rattlesnake skin around it.
The local papers in writing up the conventions frequently referred to him as “the millionaire Chief.”
Whether a millionaire or not, it was admitted that he had done much for the fire service of his state.
More than once he paid for apparatus out of his own pocket and was liberal in expenditures for the fire department over which he presided.

On Aug. 3, 1933, the Castlewood Dam crumbled, sending a deluge roaring into Denver. 
The Associated Press reported:
"Pounding down on Franktown, tiny village on a hillside four miles below the dam, the surging tide swept on six miles to Parker, at times on a mile-wide front, and picked up tons of debris as it swirled into suburban Denver and sent Cherry Creek on a rampage through the heart of the city."
Denver police and firemen - their sirens "going full blast" - sped through streets warning people to evacuate.
Seven people died in Denver, according to the National Weather Service.

Sam Van Arsdale, a firefighter with the Federal Bureau of Public Roads, was injured at the Blackwater Fire and told his story to the Associated Press from a hospital bed.
By SAM VAN ARSDALE
Cody, Wyo., Aug. 23 (AP) - When that fierce wind came up, I did the most natural thing.
I tried to get away from that terrible heat.
I threw my hands over my face and ran away from the first big wave of heat.
But, then, as I was running against the rim rock, a cross wind hit us.
The flames scorched right over my hands. They were badly burned.
I threw my hands away from my face and I screamed. And I knew my face was burned.
It was my first experience in a fire.
When I felt my face was burned, I turned around and ran down the hill toward the fire coming up from below.
I realized as I ran I was going into a fire. I began to think how horrible it would be to die that way.
So I turned around just quick enough to get away from the flames and ran back up the hill again.
Running up the heat hit me again. You just couldn't get away from it. The wind was twisting all around.
I guess I screamed and fell down. I remember I started to roll down the hill. Then it was all over.
I remember there were other fellows running with me down the hill the first time. But they didn't turn around. I guess they tried to run on through.
But I saw some of them just lay down in there and let the fire burn over them.
When I woke up lying on the ground, I was holding my face and the first thing I thought of I was going to die. I know I prayed and I think every other fellow did, too.
I though of mother and dad, and my girl friend, and my career. I wondered if I ever could use my hands again. You see, I'm going to study surgery.
Many of the fellows around me were screaming. There was still a lot of smoke and it made me panicky. I wanted to scream, too, but I realized there were fellows burned much more badly than I was, so I tried not to.
Somebody came in then and found us. A started walking out through the coals. I could feel my feet getting hot.
But we got out all right.
It was the most horrible experience I ever went through.

FIRE STARTED IN A BROTHEL:
CRIPPLE CREEK
From Legends of America
On April 25, 1896, a lovers' quarrel triggered a conflagration in the Wild West, boom-town of Cripple Creek, Colorado.
Firefighters resorted to using dynamite to topple buildings to check the flames.
In the end, much of the city was gone and thousands were without shelter.
Here is the story:
Started in one of the many brothels, a dance hall girl named Jennie Larue, got into an argument with her lover and while quarreling, accidentally upset a gasoline stove.
The wooden frame buildings of the camp quickly ignited and spread from one building to the next.
Buildings in the fire’s path were blown up in an effort to stop the approaching flames.
The fire departments of Victor, Florence, Colorado Springs and Denver dashed to the city’s aid but there was little that could be done.
Four days later, half of the city lay in smoldering ruins, when a second fire alarm went off.
This fire began in the Portland Hotel on Myers Avenue and was believed to have been deliberately set because other fires were discovered simultaneously in other parts of the city.
In this second fire, eight blocks of buildings were consumed, six lives were lost and nearly four thousand residents were left homeless.
When it was all said and done, less than ten buildings were left to mark the site of the city.
The firebugs who were suspected of setting the second fire were lynched.

EXPLOSION IN RIDGWAY
'Hugged The Ground'
On Jan. 6, 1957, an explosion tore into a crowd of 150 spectators at a fire in Ridgway in southwestern Colorado, killing three people and injuring 15 others.
Children were among those pushing for a closer view when blast hit. 
The fire - at a county garage - had been burning for 25 minutes.
Officials attributed the explosion to gasoline storage tanks or a stove, according to Associated Press dispatches in the Milwaukee Sentinel and the St. Joseph Gazette.
A woman likened the debris to shrapnel on a battlefield.
Harold Leicester, an employee of the Western Colorado Power Co., died after scaling the wall of the burning building to secure an electrical meter.
George Copeland and Virgil Gould, residents of Ridgway, also died in the explosion. 
Dean Hainey, the town's postmaster, sustained serious injuries.
"It was terrible - I thought all of us were going to be killed," said Dale Whittington, a cafe owner. "We hugged the ground for at least three minutes.
"Then I helped pick up the bodies."

DENVER, Sunday, April 19, VIA JULESBURG, Tuesday, April 21.
At 2 o'clock this morning a fire broke out in the; Cherokee House, in the center of the business part of the town, and had acquired such headway before it was discovered that it was impossible to check it. The flames spread to the surrounding buildings and in less than an hour the greater part of four blocks was in ruins. By blowing up and tearing down buildings the fire was checked at about 5 o'clock, and at the present writing, is about subdued. The loss will reach nearly $1,500,000. The loss in flour and other provisions was very heavy.

On Sept. 26, 1973, an explosion trapped workers atop a grain elevator in Loveland and fire officials called for a helicopter to rescue them. 
The blast ripped out a section of the Big Thompson Mill and Elevator from levels three to seven, according to the archives of the Loveland Fire Rescue Authority.
The alarm was transmitted at 1:56 p.m. and the first engine - call sign “City 1” – arrived at the "Big T" four minutes later reporting “multiple injuries.”
All available fire equipment was ordered to the scene. Aid arrived from Berthoud and Fort Collins.
At 5:30 p.m., the helicopter arrived to reach the perched workers, aided by the Mountain Rescue Group of the Larimer County Sheriff’s Department.
Fire investigators determined the explosion was triggered by a fault in a welding cable.

GUMRY HOTEL DISASTER
 Boiler Explosion, Fire Killed 22
One of the Mile High City's deadliest accidents
Denver Fire Journal
On Aug. 19, 1895, a boiler exploded at downtown Denver's Gumry Hotel while the boiler operator was drinking at a saloon.
"Naught but the walls were left intact," the Aspen Weekly Times reported.
A Utah newspaper called it "a gaunt and sinister ruin."
The explosion killed 22 people including Peter Gumry, proprietor.
Newspapers published graphic details of the disaster. The hotel was located on Lawrence Street between Seventeenth and Eighteenth streets.
"The firemen, with light and torch, entered all parts of the hotel," according to a daily quoted by an insurance journal. "Out of the pile of brick, wood and iron below came feeble moans and piteous cries."
James Murphy, trapped in the ruins, pleaded with firemen to amputate his leg. Moments later a wall collapsed and buried Murphy. He died.
M.E. Letson, a dairyman, who waited 10 hours for rescuers to reach him, told a newspaper correspondent of his ordeal:
"You cannot have the slightest idea of my feelings as I lay there in the bottom of the basement with all the ruins on top and around me, hearing the excruciating cries of the dying and those in agony and being almost overcome by the shock, and also soaked with water and almost drowned and fearing that the next minute I would be buried alive."
Three Denver firemen - P. Gilchrist, J.E. Troy and Louis Maguire - were injured when a wall collapsed and "were almost suffocated to death by smoke and dust," according to a dispatch published in a New Jersey newspaper. [Daily True American of Trenton] The firemen were treated at the county hospital "where it was found they were not seriously injured."  
Boiler operator Helmuth Loescher fled Denver and was returned to face investigators.
A coroner's jury determined it was impossible to assign blame, according to October 1895 edition of The Locomotive, a publication of the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company. [Google Books archive]
'Cries of a babe and the moans of men and women could be heard, but the flames and smoke increased, and finally the voices were all silenced'
From daily newspaper account 
 
Author Howard Potter Dunham, writing in a 1912 textbook [Google Books archive] entitled "The Business of Insurance," said the boiler contained adequate water.
However, the jury assailed Gumry and his business partner for allowing Loescher to work long hours; censured Loescher for negligence; and criticized the city boiler inspector for lax procedures and standards.
Excerpt of verdict [Chronicling America]:
"From the testimony submitted, which was conflicting, we are unable to fix the responsibility for the disaster upon any one person, but we believe the owners and managers, Peter Gumry and Robert C. Greiner, were blamable for requiring of the engineer sixteen hours' work out of twenty-four - a request far beyond the ability of any man to endure and perform good work; also for employing an engineer whose habits were dissipated and unreliable, and whose experience did not justify them in placing him in such a responsible position, all of which were well known to them.
"We find that the engineer, Helmuth Loescher, had been drinking on the night of the disaster, and further, he had not examined the safety valve to the boiler for two months, proving him unfit to occupy any position where security to life and property depends upon the faithful performance of duty."
Jury members: K. G. Cooper, F. B. Croke, F. E. Edbrooke, Charles W. Babcock, Frank M. Demange and R. W. Speer.
"Walls have been torn down, but three upper floors and an immense square skylight in the roof  hangs suspended in midair directly over where the bodies are supposed to be … Firemen, laborers and their superintendents have worked incessantly, but little appears to have been accomplished … Chief of Police Goulding is in receipt of hundreds of letters and telegrams from all over the country making inquiry of the missing" - San Francisco Call [8/21]
"Every engine in the city was called to the scene … The firemen worked with great heroism. The heat was intense, and the smoke blinding. Electric light wires dangling in the alley, and walls tottering to a fall, increased the perils of the situation." - Oswego Daily Times [8/19]

TUNNEL of FLAMES
Tragedy at Elitch's
Fire Engulfed Ride
Six Perished 
On July 16, 1944, fire roared through a "tunnel of love" boat ride at Denver's famed Elitch Gardens amusement park. A locked gate delayed fire engines from reaching the blaze.
Smoke blackened the "Old Mill" boat ride, which featured colorful vessels and oil-painted canvas scenes.
Six people died. Four of the dead were soldiers and their wives. Two worked at the park and rushed into the flames to save the others. 
"Flames were still at their height when firemen crashed through the walls of the Old Mill with axes," the Associated Press reported.
William Kilbourne, a soldier from Louisville, Kentucky, was credited with saving lives by pushing boats out of the tunnel.
"I heard a scream and looked back over my shoulder," Kilbourne said. "I saw a flash of flame in other boat or beside it."
The tragedy led to reforms in the municipal fire code.
"For nearly an hour firemen feared the entire million dollar park would be burned down"

FIREMEN CHASE HORSE, WAGON, FIRE
 Holiday Pursuit in Downtown Denver
By The United Press
DENVER - "Julius Caesar," a milk wagon horse with a sense of humor, and the Denver Fire Department gave Christmas shoppers a treat when they played "tag" in the main business section Saturday.
Julius, as a rule, goes about his business like any ordinary horse, but when an oil stove in the wagon exploded while the driver was delivering a bottle of milk, he broke away.
As Julius kicked up the snow in a burst of speed down a busy avenue, scattering bottles of milk, six fire trucks took up the pursuit.
The firemen "tagged" Julius after a chase of five blocks and extinguished the blaze.

On Aug. 21, 1899, fire destroyed 14 blocks of Victor, Colorado, leaving the gold mining town's business district in ashes.
Firefighters failed to contain the flames even after turning to  dynamite to topple buildings, most of which were made of pine timber.
A train rushed firefighters from other cities, according to a dispatch in the Boston Evening Transcript.
A year earlier, fire destroyed the city jail, which was also made of timber, killing several inmates.

On April 16, 1955, Aurora fire crews rescued little David Mark Counterman, 2, from the bottom of an 18-foot water well shaft.
Firemen lowered into a rescue shaft bored by city workers and telephone company drillers cut through dirt and rock to reach the boy who tumbled into the abyss.
Oxygen pumped into the well sustained David during the four-hour drama.
"He screamed all the time he was in the hole," said George Moorehead, fire chief of Aurora. "But the minute we laid hands on him, he gave us a feeble smile and stopped.
"He knew he was OK," Moorehead said in an Associated Press story printed in the Sunday News-Press of St. Joseph, Missouri.

They say that St James Palace is a maze of corridors and quite clumsy.
Does anyone know of the corridor that is supoosed to connect St James and Clarence House?
After the death of George IV in 1830, the Duke of Clarence acceded to the Throne as William IV.
In start contrast to his late brother, William IV was quite informal and not at all extravagent, and preferred to remain living at Clarence House as King.
When the Houses of Parliament were destroyed by fire in 1834, William IV actually offered the new Buckingham Palace as a ready-made replacement (Parliament declined).
William IV's main concession to his new role as Sovereign was the addition of a corridor at first-floor level in Clarence House to connect with the State Apartments of St. James's Palace.
I'm not sure exactly where it is located - but old floor plans I have seen show a couple of small closets or anterooms at the western end of the first floor State Apartments at St. James' Palace (along with a back staircase), right where the two building meet.
I'd imagine that's where the corridor was added - which would also be right behind (north) of the Prince of Wales' bedroom suite which faces south over the palace gardens and the Mall.
Thanks Chris.
Do you happen to know where I could see those pics?

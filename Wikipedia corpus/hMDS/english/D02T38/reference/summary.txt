The exhumation and reburial of Richard III began with the discovery of the king's remains within the site of the former Greyfriars Friary Church in Leicester, England, in September 2012.
Following extensive anthropological and genetic testing, the remains of Richard III, the last English king killed in battle, were ultimately reinterred at Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015.
Richard III, the final ruler of the Plantagenet dynasty, was killed on 22 August 1485 in the Battle of Bosworth Field, the last significant battle of the Wars of the Roses.
His body was taken to Greyfriars Friary in Leicester, where it was buried in a crude grave in the friary church.
Following the friary's dissolution in 1538 and subsequent demolition, Richard's tomb was lost.
An account arose that Richard's bones had been thrown into the River Soar at the nearby Bow Bridge.

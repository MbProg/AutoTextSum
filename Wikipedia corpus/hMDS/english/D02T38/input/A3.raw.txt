THE STATUE OF RICHARD III AT MIDDLEHAM CASTLE
Statement from English Heritage.
We have been contacted by Gillian Savage, the Manager of Middleham Castle, who has given us the following statement from English Heritage with regards to the recent publicity about replacement of the statue of Richard III at the castle:
...
"We have been approached by various people who are keen to see the statue reviewed in the light of the discovery of Richards remains and the discoveries over the last few years. In support. people have been looking at fundraising opportunities, but any statue replacement would have to be authorized by and designed in conjunction with English Heritage and the English Heritage curatorial team."

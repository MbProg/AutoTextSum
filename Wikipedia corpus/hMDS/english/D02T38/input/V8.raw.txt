Historians identify 'spot where Richard III was killed in battle'

A pair of historians believe they have identified the spot where Richard III was killed in battle.
In their new book Bosworth 1485: A Battlefield Rediscovered, Professor Anne Curry and Dr Glenn Foard pinpoint east of the battlefield a spot where the king supposedly met his violent death.
Through archaeological research and a study of the landscape, Curry and Foard have concluded Richard that was most likely killed at Fenn Lane, near Ambion Hill in Leicestershire.
The Roman road crossing a stream may be the ford referred to in the name ‘Sandeford’. Further research will be carried out to test this theory.
“We believe Richard takes the cavalry down Fenn Lane, fails, and so he and his men are then pursued by Henry’s troops up the marshy lane,” Curry said.
“This fits with accounts we have of Richard’s death, which was in a wet area.
“His horse gets stuck when Richard is attacked around the head.”
Curry explained the site is also close to where a number of items linked to the death of Richard were found, such as a silver-gilt badge in the shape of a boar and a chape – the crossbar of a sword.
“We have not got his body there of course but by studying the landscape and putting it together with archaeological research, we have a pretty good argument,” she said.
Curry and Foard were part of a team that in 2010 identified what is now believed to be the true site of the 1485 Battle of Bosworth .
The pair have been working on their book, Bosworth 1485: A Battlefield Rediscovered, for around three years.
“It’s been very rewarding, particularly in terms of working with archeologists,” said Curry.
“It’s rare for historians and archaeologists to work so closely together. It has entailed lots of different processes.”

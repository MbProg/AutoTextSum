Dig to reveal city's medieval era
Bristol Cathedral now stands on the site of the abbey
A formal excavation process is to start at Canon's Marsh on the harbourside in Bristol, to reveal more about life in the city more than 500 years ago.
The four-month archaeological dig will try to piece together the daily activities of monks who lived at the medieval abbey.
The city's Anglican cathedral now stands on the historic site.
A nearby dig four years ago unearthed glassworks and coins from the 17th Century.
Project manager Richard Young said he hoped the dig would discover enough evidence to reveal a detailed picture of monastic life.

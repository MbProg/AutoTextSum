<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Dark Ages or Early Middle 
Ages confirmed the increasing importance of cavalry in conjunction with the bow, 
even in the Balkans with its wooded mountainous terrain. The region was 
dominated by the Byzantine Empire which sought to resist new barbarian invasions 
from north of the Danube. However, by the end of this period these invaders had 
established themselves in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;<b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Bulgars, 
Slavs &amp; Avars 500-600</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;New barbarian tribes, the Bulgars and the Slavs were 
pushed south into the Balkans by the Avars. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;The Slavs began to infiltrate 
the Balkans around 500. They came in small groups first to raid and later to 
settle in fortified earthworks called grads (eg. modern Belgrade). Each clan was 
lead by a Zupan. These were grouped into tribes with chieftains called Voivodes 
or Grand Zupan. Early Slav armies consisted almost entirely of javelin armed 
infantry with some archers and other ill-armed peasants. As they became more 
settled the chieftains developed a small retinue of cavalry called Druzhinas. 
Militarily they were most effective in broken terrain and when allied with 
Bulgars or Avars who provided a strong cavalry element. Despite reverses such as 
Sardica (Sofia) in 550 they occupied most of the Balkans by the end of the 
century.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;The Bulgars in contrast were 
Asiatic horseman related to the Huns. The core of their armies consisted of 
heavy noble cavalry supported by swarms of light horse archers. In the 6th 
Century they were subjects of the Avars who had absorbed the remnants of the 
Huns. Their raids reached Constantinople in 559 when Belisarius was brought out 
of retirement to force them back from Thrace.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;The Avars were heavy bow armed 
cavalry who after initially being paid by Justinian to attack the Slavs, allied 
themselves with the Balkan Slavs, Gepids and Bulgars to ravage the Balkans. 
Under the great chief Bayan they reached as far south as the Aegean in 591. They 
were finally defeated in a series of battles on the Danube at Viminacium by the 
Emperor Maurice in 601. The mobility of the Avars and their allies being negated 
by disciplined squares of Byzantine troops<sup><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; position: relative; top: -3.0pt">1</span></font></sup>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Whilst the Avars, Bulgars and 
Slavs occupied the Balkans the Byzantine Empire reached its greatest extent 
under Justinian (527-565). Byzantine armies under Belisarius and Narses fought 
successful wars against the Ostrogoths in Italy, the Vandals in Africa and the 
Persians. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Byzantine Empire 
602-800</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The Byzantine Empire spent the 7th Century on the 
defensive in the Balkans while it fought most of its wars in the East resisting 
Sassanid and then Arab invasions. The Avars regularly swept through the Balkans 
with peace being bought with tribute. In 626 a 100,000 strong Avar army 
(including Slavs and Bulgars) invested Constantinople in conjunction with the 
Persians. In a desperate siege the Emperor Heraclius fought off the combined 
assaults. He went on to save the Empire defeating the Sassanids at Nineveh in 
627.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;In the later 7th and 8th Centuries the Empire was limited 
to the coastal regions and Thrace largely due to Arab invasions from the East 
which culminated in yet another epic siege of Constantinople in 717.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Slavs occupied Illyricum, 
Macedonia and Greece as semi-independent tribes, eventually throwing off Avar 
control. Four distinct groups developed; Slovenes, Croats, Serbs and those who 
intermixed with the Bulgars.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Intermittent wars with the 
Byzantines continued throughout the century. Emperors came to accept that the 
tide of Slav tribes could not be halted and therefore negotiated treaties and 
sent punitive expeditions into the Balkans when agreements were broken or dues 
not paid. Unlike the Asiatic nomads the Slavs transformed themselves from 
marauders to settlers. The original settlers did not disappear. The Illyrians 
were forced westward into the mountains of Albania and the Greeks south to 
modern Greece and the islands. The Latin speaking provincials were forced to the 
uplands preserving a degree of individuality reflected to this day in modern 
Romania.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;The Franks made some inroads 
into the western fringes of the Balkans assisting both the Byzantines and Slavs 
by destroying the Avars by the end of the 8th century.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Bulgaria </span></b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The Bulgars established an independent kingdom between the 
Balkan Mountains and the lower Danube plus parts of modern day Romania under 
Isperich (643-701). Under Terbelis they defeated the Byzantines at Anchialus 
708. There was a brief alliance with Byzantium in 718 when a Bulgarian army 
helped defeat the invading Arab armies at Adrianople. Constantine V gained the 
upper hand in the wars of 755-772 with victories at Marcellae 759 and Anchialus 
763. However, by the end of the century Kardam of the Bulgars was once again 
forcing Byzantium to pay tribute. The army of this period relied heavily on Slav 
infantry armed with either javelin or bow. Usually only a third of the force 
would be the effective Bulgar cavalry.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b>The 9th Century Bulgars under Khan Krum raided 
westwards into Croatia and Serbia as well as southwards. Emperor Nicephorus 
sacked the Bulgar capital of Pliska in 811 before being trapped in a mountain 
pass, dying with his army. In 813 Krum besieged Constantinople after defeating 
another Byzantine army at Versinikia,&nbsp; but without a fleet he was powerless to 
capture the city. After Krums death his son Omortag was defeated at the Battle 
of Mesembria 817 by Leo V and the Bulgars agreed to a thirty year peace. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;In 866 Emperor Michael III and his uncle Bardas invaded 
Bulgaria. Bulgarian King Boris I (852-889) was forced to accept Christianity and 
was unsuccessful in attempts to expand westwards into Croatia and Serbia.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">His second son Symeon (893-927) 
fought a series of wars with the Byzantine Empire gaining Macedonia, Thessaly 
and Albania. In 895 he allied with the Pechenegs (another nomadic race of horse 
archers) defeating the Magyars in the north before turning south to defeat the 
Byzantines driving them to the gates of Constantinople. He finally brought 
Serbia under Bulgar control in 918, although he failed in Croatia. However, in 
the North he lost Transylvania and Pannonia to the Magyars and Wallachia to the 
Pechenegs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;After Symeon's death the Bulgar state declined. In 967-69 
a concerted invasion by the Byzantines from the south and the Russians by sea 
overran the country. The invaders fell out over the spoils and a victorious 
Byzantine Empire (Battles of Arcadioplois 970 and Dorostalon 971) annexed all of 
Eastern Bulgaria up to the Danube in 972. The Serbs also revolted and the 
Magyars raided southwards at will.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Samuel (976-1014) 
re-established the Bulgarian state in 976 and defeated an invading Byzantine 
army near Sofia in 981. He went on to occupy all of Thessaly by 989. Samuel 
established himself in Macedonia around the great lakes, Ochrid and Prespa, with 
fortifications and a mobile field army. Byzantine Emperor Basil II returned from 
his difficulties with the Arabs to capture Eastern Bulgaria and then defeating 
Samuel at Spercheios 996 recovering Greece and Macedonia. Samuel 
counter-attacked and the war continued until the decisive Battle of Balathista 
(Macedonia) 1014 where a fortified Bulgar army in the Kleidon Pass was surprised 
by a Byzantine force which traversed the mountains. After the battle Basil 
blinded 15,000 captives earning himself the title 'Basil the Bulgar Slayer'. 
Samuel died of shock when the captives returned home. Basil went on to capture 
the Macedonian forts and Bulgaria became a Byzantine province for the next 168 
years<sup><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; position: relative; top: -3.0pt">2</span></font></sup>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">The Magyars</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;The Magyars (or Hungarians)&nbsp; 
were the last steppe peoples to settle in the Balkans. Unlike most of the steppe 
tribes previously described, the Magyars belonged to the Finno-Ugric language 
group rather than Turkic or Mongol. However, they were still mounted archers and 
their method of warfare was similar to the Huns and Avars who preceded them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;The Magyars were driven from 
the steppe by the Pechenegs<sup><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; position: relative; top: -3.0pt">3</span></font></sup>&nbsp;and&nbsp; 
established themselves in Hungary from 899 under their chieftain Arpad, driving 
the Slavs south out of the Danube valley. Their main invasion effort 
concentrated on Germany. For more than a century they invaded Northern Italy, 
Germany and France until their decisive defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. 
As the poet Bishop Liutprand exclaimed &quot;No man ever wished more desperately for 
food or water than these savages desire a fight ... their only joy is in 
battle&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">After Lechfeld Hungary became a 
settled European state converted to Christianity by Bavarian missionaries. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;The Slav tribes West of the 
Bulgars known as Serbs coalesced as a state in the 9th Century. They 
acknowledged the suzerainty of the Byzantines and were converted to Christianity 
by the missionary work of Cyril and others. Their loose affiliation to the 
Empire was insufficient to fend off the Bulgars. Conquered by Symeon of Bulgaria 
in 918 there was a brief period of independence under Prince Chaslav in 931 
before again being conquered by the Bulgars. The Serbs did not regain autonomy 
until the 11th Century.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;<b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Croatia</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;To the West of the Serbs were 
found another Slav tribal group, the Croats. Although the original Croats were 
probably Iranian and became assimilated by the Slavs. The Croats&nbsp; original 
twelve tribes were invited to occupy lands in Dalmatia under Byzantine rule, as 
confirmed in a treaty in 678. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;In the 9th and early 10th 
centuries Croatia was overrun at different times by Franks, Moravians, Bulgars, 
Magyars, and the Byzantines. The Franks held most of Slavonia and Croatia 
following the peace of Aachen 812, with the Byzantines retaining the coastal 
towns of Dalmatia<sup><span style="font-size:10.0pt">4</span></sup>. At this 
time both of the Croatian Dukes converted to Christianity. Duke Trpimir 
(845-864) gained considerable autonomy from the Western Empire and defeated a 
Byzantine army in 846. At the end of his reign the Croats came under the 
religious sway of Rome, dividing them from their Slavic cousins to the East.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;After internal squabbles Duke 
Branimir gained papal recognition as the first independent ruler of Croatia in 
879. The new state fought off the growing strength of Venice and although 
Slavonia was overrun by the Magyars, Duke Tomislav held them off establishing 
the Kingdom of the Croats in 925. This state probably included modern Croatia, 
Slavonia and much of Northern and Western Bosnia including the Dalmation coast. 
The settled state was rocked by civil war in 949 losing Bosnia to the Serbs and 
control of the Dalmatian towns to Venice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Drzislav (969-997) supported 
the Byzantines against the Bulgars and was recognised as an independent monarch 
in 988.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;<b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Conclusion</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;The Dark Ages in the Balkans 
were dominated by the invasions from the steppes. Whilst on some occasions the 
effects were transitory, other groups established themselves permanently. The 
outline of&nbsp; the modern Balkans can be seen with the establishment of the states 
of Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria. The Byzantine Empire was the dominant influence 
on the Balkans particularly in the South and at the end of this period was in 
revival.</p>

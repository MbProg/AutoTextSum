Somethings change or do they?
Thank goodness we no longer throw people in
prison if they are in debt.
Behind these gates was where the notorious Marshalsea prison stood between 1373 - 1842.
One of the more well known prisoners was none other than Charles Dickens.
Prisons were private enterprise businesses run for profit during these times.
There were shops, bars and even a restaurant for those that could afford it.
A bit of a problem if you were in there for your debts in the first place.
Without friends on the outside you might even starve to death.
Lucky prisons aren't ruled by profit anymore.
Oh, but don't our governments want to change that?
Aren't they slowly being sold to private companies?
What will be be saying about the new prisons in 500 yrs I wonder.

They used to hang you for debt in England also.

That's a good question.
We've got some "for profit" prisons here and they have been involved in a few scandals.
There is a move to get rid of them.

This park used to be my lunch time haunt!
I worked in the building to the left of those gates and that sign but I first escaped to head office before my company sold the building.

Our previous PM wanted this sort of arrangement here as well.

Independent 8109 / Dac
Posted by duncanshiell on October 10th, 2012
This was another excellent puzzle by Dac.
He really does write clues that make good sense.
I always look for Ninas and themes in puzzles that I blog, but I know I will very rarely find such things in a puzzle by Dac.
He just concentrates on producing good clues that lead to words that most of us use on a regular basis.
Inevitably there will be one or two words or phrases that have to be shoe horned into the crossing letters.
Today, I felt that NOISE ABROAD might fall into that category.
On the other hand, the clue was so smooth that perhaps it was a phrase that Dac wanted to clue and put into the grid early on.
All the other words and phrases were fairly well known to me.
I came across MARSHALSEA recently watching a bit of an adaption of one of Charles Dickens‘ works on television.
I had to do some research on the film Un Chien Andalou to confirm the reference to EYEBALL.
I liked the misdirection of rambler at 3d.
Other clues I enjoyed were those for BELLADONNA (14a ), GRANOLA (22a), and FILMABLE (16d).
I expect there was an uprising somewhere in 1051.
The only parsing I have struggled with slightly is at 7d AGA SAGA.
I struggle a bit with relating the final three letters AGA to ‘reprint almost’.
Across
No.

Afternote: the simpler and more elegant parsing of M AND DATE being the component parts of the word MATE seems far better than my rather strained effort.
Thanks to all who have suggested it

Book a great success – reprint almost complete (3,4)
A + GAS (something delightful; impressive; great success) + AGAIN (reprint?)
excluding the final two letters [almost complete] IN  I’m not entirely happy with AGAIN as a definition of ‘reprint’, nor am I happy dropping two letters rather than one for ‘almost complete’, but I can’t think of an alternative.
I hope someone can suggest a better parsing.

denis loretto
Tuesday 30 June 2015 12.02pm
As we all know one of our historic relics is the original wall of Marshalsea prison - featured in Dickens' Little Dorrit.
It is in Angel Place off Borough High Street and borders one side of the graveyard of St George the Martyr .
Not any more!
OK - original brickwork is still in there but such is the degree of "refurbishment" currently being carried out (by Southwark Borough Council?)
that it is hard to recognise its original features.
Several courses of new brickwork have been added at the top and a capping of level concrete coping stones added.
When I looked today, workmen seemed to be regrouting the entire old brickwork, severely damaging any real sense of antiquity.
Presumably it was deemed necessary to carry out remedial work to combat crumbling of brickwork and avoid danger to pedestrians but my impression is that this has gone way too far.
Anyone else with any thoughts about this?

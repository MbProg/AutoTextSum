We take abuse seriously in our never-ending book quiz.
Only flag lists that clearly need our attention.
As a general rule we do not censor any content on the site.
The only content we will consider removing is spam,      slanderous attacks on other members,       or extremely offensive content       (eg.
pornography, pro-Nazi, child abuse, etc).
We will not remove any content for bad language alone,     or for being critical of a book.

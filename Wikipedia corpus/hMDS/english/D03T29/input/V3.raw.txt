In 1824 Charles Dickens' father was imprisoned in the Marshalsea, and in 1857 the prison was used as the setting for Little Dorrit.
Administrative / biographical background:
By the late eighteenth century the prison of the Marshalsea lay on a site adjoining the King's Bench Prison in Borough High Street, Southwark. The prison was originally a branch of the Court of the Verge and Marshal, the disciplinary department of the medieval royal household (not to be confused with the Marshal of the King's Bench who had responsibility for prisoners in the King's Bench prison). In later periods it was a major debtors' prison and also held Admiralty prisoners: smugglers, those charged with excise offences, and sailors who had been court-martialled.
It was abolished under the Queen's Prison Act 1842, and prisoners were transferred to the Queen's Prison.

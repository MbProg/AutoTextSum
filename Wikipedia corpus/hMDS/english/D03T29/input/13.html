Probably, Dickens wanted to show how unfair it was to eliminate criminality of the Victorian society by sentencing convicts to transportation as it were not a social problem. </p><p>The hulks, the name that received the ships that transported convicts to the penal colony Australia, were used as floating prisons. In the novel, Dickens offers the reader a portrait of the convicts when being transported to the hulks: </p><p>“At that time </div><div class="paragraphA"><a href="/web/20160516141925/http://essaymania.com/130824/capital-punishment-9">Capital Punishment 9</a><br />Capital Punishment Capital punishment should not be reintroduced into Australia or any other country.

Also the treatment of convicts on trips was inhuman: “Cruel masters, harsh discipline and scurvy, dysentery and typhoid resulted in a huge loss of life”.

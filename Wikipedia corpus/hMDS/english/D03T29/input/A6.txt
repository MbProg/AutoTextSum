Independent 8109 / Dac
Posted by duncanshiell on October 10th, 2012
This was another excellent puzzle by Dac.
He really does write clues that make good sense.
I always look for Ninas and themes in puzzles that I blog, but I know I will very rarely find such things in a puzzle by Dac.
He just concentrates on producing good clues that lead to words that most of us use on a regular basis.
Inevitably there will be one or two words or phrases that have to be shoe horned into the crossing letters.
Today, I felt that NOISE ABROAD might fall into that category.
On the other hand, the clue was so smooth that perhaps it was a phrase that Dac wanted to clue and put into the grid early on.
All the other words and phrases were fairly well known to me.
I came across MARSHALSEA recently watching a bit of an adaption of one of Charles Dickens‘ works on television.
I had to do some research on the film Un Chien Andalou to confirm the reference to EYEBALL.
I liked the misdirection of rambler at 3d.
Other clues I enjoyed were those for BELLADONNA (14a ), GRANOLA (22a), and FILMABLE (16d).
I expect there was an uprising somewhere in 1051.
The only parsing I have struggled with slightly is at 7d AGA SAGA.
I struggle a bit with relating the final three letters AGA to ‘reprint almost’.

Thanks, Dac and Duncan.
The eyeball in Un Chien Andalou is of course not cut out, just cut across.

Yes, an excellent offering from Dac and relatively easy after the last two days.
I concur with K’s D on the parsing of AGA SAGA – but I couldn’t parse ADO (I thought of ‘Adonis’ as a ‘poster boy’ but couldn’t equate the removal of ‘nis’ with ‘unclothed’), so thanks, Duncan, for that.
Re 3dn, I always thought the ship’s toilet was ‘heads’ but I see that under ‘head’ Chambers just says “often in plural”.

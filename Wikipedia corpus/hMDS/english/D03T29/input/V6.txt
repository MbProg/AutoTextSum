Independent 8109 / Dac
Posted by duncanshiell on October 10th, 2012
This was another excellent puzzle by Dac.
He really does write clues that make good sense.
I always look for Ninas and themes in puzzles that I blog, but I know I will very rarely find such things in a puzzle by Dac.
He just concentrates on producing good clues that lead to words that most of us use on a regular basis.
Inevitably there will be one or two words or phrases that have to be shoe horned into the crossing letters.
Today, I felt that NOISE ABROAD might fall into that category.
On the other hand, the clue was so smooth that perhaps it was a phrase that Dac wanted to clue and put into the grid early on.
All the other words and phrases were fairly well known to me.
I came across MARSHALSEA recently watching a bit of an adaption of one of Charles Dickens‘ works on television.
I had to do some research on the film Un Chien Andalou to confirm the reference to EYEBALL.
I liked the misdirection of rambler at 3d.
Other clues I enjoyed were those for BELLADONNA (14a ), GRANOLA (22a), and FILMABLE (16d).
I expect there was an uprising somewhere in 1051.
The only parsing I have struggled with slightly is at 7d AGA SAGA.
I struggle a bit with relating the final three letters AGA to ‘reprint almost’.
Across
No.
Clue
Wordplay
Entry
1
Ultimately getting very thin?
Probably not, if this (6)

4
Officials releasing last two characters from prison (8)
MARSHALSEA (reference MARSHALSEA prison situated on the south bank of the River Thames in Southwark, now part of London.
From the 14th century until it closed in 1842, it housed men under court martial for crimes at sea, including those accused of "unnatural crimes", political figures and intellectuals accused of sedition – and most famously London’s debtors.
Charles Dickens’ father was imprisoned as a debtor in MARSHALSEA and Little Dorrit has a number of scenes set in the prison) excluding (releasing) EA the last two characters

Afternote: the simpler and more elegant parsing of M AND DATE being the component parts of the word MATE seems far better than my rather strained effort.
Thanks to all who have suggested it
MANDATE (charge, instruction; commission) – I suppose we should be looking at equality but WOMANDATE isn’t a word that dictionaries recognise.
14

SPRING (an outflow of water from the earth; well OR well up) double definition
7
Book a great success – reprint almost complete (3,4)
A + GAS (something delightful; impressive; great success) + AGAIN (reprint?)
excluding the final two letters [almost complete] IN  I’m not entirely happy with AGAIN as a definition of ‘reprint’, nor am I happy dropping two letters rather than one for ‘almost complete’, but I can’t think of an alternative.
I hope someone can suggest a better parsing.
Afternote: Kathryn’s dad has ridden to the rescue at comment 1 below> The AGA at the end is a ‘reprint’ of A GAS excluding the final letter (almost complete) S

Thank you, Duncan.
You are right, this was another excellent puzzle from Dac – seldom any bells and whistles, but always a sound crossword with plenty to enjoy.
BELLADONNA was clever, I thought, and I was pleased to remember MARSHALSEA to give me MARSHALS.
AGA SAGA is A GAS A GA[S], with the second A GAS being ‘almost complete’.

Thanks, Dac and Duncan.
The eyeball in Un Chien Andalou is of course not cut out, just cut across.

Yes, an excellent offering from Dac and relatively easy after the last two days.
I concur with K’s D on the parsing of AGA SAGA – but I couldn’t parse ADO (I thought of ‘Adonis’ as a ‘poster boy’ but couldn’t equate the removal of ‘nis’ with ‘unclothed’), so thanks, Duncan, for that.
Re 3dn, I always thought the ship’s toilet was ‘heads’ but I see that under ‘head’ Chambers just says “often in plural”.

13a – I parsed it as ‘M’ and ‘Ate’, being the components of ‘mate’

Thanks Dac and Duncan.
I needed your explanation for NOISE ABROAD, which I wrote in without understanding.
I did, however, parse MANDATE simply as M AND ATE, which seems fairer.

My only even vaguealy negative though with this was the use of ‘in the end’ at 24.
Otherwise what a great puzzle!
Here is the master of smooth surfaces, and I loved every minute of the 20 I spent on it!
Great stuff Dac and Duncan.

Thanks for the improved parsing of <MANDATE.
I’ve updated the blog.

Thanks, Dac and Duncan.
I found this a bit harder than usual for a Dac puzzle with the NE corner the hardest – possibly because of some less familiar (to me) answers.
All completely fair with, as others have said, excellent surface readings all through.

Got it all eventually, and I think I was able to parse every clue.
I quickly noticed that “deadhead” and “deathcap” could both fit the crossing letters for 3dn, and I could fit neither to either definition or wordplay for a very long time – it was nearly the last one in.
Needed a word search for 7dn, which was a phrase I was vaguely familiar with, and that gave me the final crossing letter for 15dn.

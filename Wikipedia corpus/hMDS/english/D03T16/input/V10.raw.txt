In this paper, the writer has attempted to clarify the pedagogical stereotype that has hindered many historians of education from pointing out that corporal punishment was never abolished in the early modern history of educational thoughts. In fact, according to the writer's perusal of the texts, the early modern educationists permitted a rod or beating as a last resort of correction, while they denounced corporal punishment. For example, John Locke did admire the use of the "Whipping" for children's "Obstinacy" and "Stubbornness" in his famous book Some Thoughts concerning Education (1693,see §78), though he denounced corporal punishment as a "slavish" one in the same book (§52). Locke admitted the corporal punishment as a means of discipline, for it was not outside (corporal) punishment. The same fact can be pointed out in the educational thoughts of Quintilian, Augustine, Erasmus, Joseph Lancaster, Pestalozzi, Horace Mann, and so forth. Lancaster, while he condemned the corporal punishment, recommended the punishment of pillory, fetters, and "the birds in the cage". Similarly, Mann maintained the corporal punishment as a lesser evil that cured the grave evil. In spite of such undeniable facts, many historians of education have ignored the facts. Why? The writer maintains that the eyes of historians of education have been blurred by the pedagogical stereotype that emerged to obtain a professional authority of the educational science in the nineteenth century. For example, Joseph Payne, as "the first professor of education in England", established such a pedagogical stereotype in his lecture "On Corporal Punishment as a means of discipline in Schools" (The Educational Times, March 1861). He pretended to demonstrate that corporal punishment was denied as a means of discipline as well as a means of promoting learning in the history of orthodox educational thoughts including John Locke's.

In this paper, the writer has attempted to reconsider a manslaughter case against a schoolmaster (Regina v. Hopley, 1860) by examining contemporary newspapers and educational journals. Through this research, he intends to clarify not only the incident itself but also public reactions and opinions for/against school corporal punishment. Regina v. Hopley had been regarded as an archetype of legal cases of school corporal punishment in commentaries on the laws of England, until the school corporal punishment was abolished in 1987. But, curiously enough, the incident itself and contemporary reactions have never been brought to light. Because of such absence of full investigative research, we often tended to consider Regina v. Hopley to have been only a trivial and minor matter for contemporary people. However, as the writer has provided a detailed picture on account of his investigation of local newspapers (The Sussex Advertiser, The Lews Times, The Sussex Express, and so on), the Hopley's incident was most sensational and caused the greatest excitement in England. Local newspapers enthusiastically reported the case in detail, and furthermore, submitted a profile of Hopley's career and their analyses of "The Eastbourne Tragedy" (The Brighton Observer, 11 May 1860). Furthermore, most of English and Scotch principal newspapers also reported the trial of Hopley (July 23,1860) and made comments on the incident; The Times, The Illustrated London News, Saturday Review, The Bristol Mercury, The Manchester Guardian, The Caledonian Mercury (Edingburgh), and so on. It is certain, as English legal textbooks told us, that Regina v. Hopley permitted a "moderate and reasonable" corporal punishment. But on the other hand, it is more certain that the "brutal affair" stimulated popular feelings averse to corporal punishment. For example, The Sussex Advertiser pointed out how Hopley's "miserable desire" to establish his educational system "converted correction into cruel and brutally aggravated punishment", and The Brighton Observer (May 11) demanded "the abolition of all corporal punishment in the schools of England" in order to prevent a recurrence of such tragedies. And, above all, not only Justice Cockburn and the prosecutor Parry but also the pleader Ballantine hoped for a school without corporal punishment in the court. On the other hand, it was only four of twelve educational periodicals published in 1860 that made comments on the Hopley case. Most of them, except Papers for the Schoolmaster, were averse to the "public opinion" expressed vigorously in the newspapers; especially their proposal of "the total abolition of corporal punishment" (The Brighton Examiner, 31 July 1860). But they were obliged to keep silence and left behind "public opinion". In order to relieve the educational discourses from such peril and establish a professional leadership in the debate on school corporal punishment, Joseph Payne attempted to formulate a new pedagogical paradigm of school corporal punishment from a point of view of "Science and Art of Education" in his lecture (The Educational Times, March 1861). He was "the first professor of education in Britain" (Richard Aldrich). He himself, however, did not argue against the use of physical punishment as a means of maintaining discipline. He denied only habitual use of corporal punishment. Rather, he asserted that "a vigilant administration", which corresponds to the "pouvoir pastoral" (Michel Foucault), was necessary for the discipline and it would become a basis for the effectiveness of corporal punishment. In Payne's lecture, Hopley's act was criticized merely for its "cool, conscientious barbarity". However, Hopley vindicated his act as a deliberate and educational one based upon John Locke's view of corporal punishment which Payne also referred to as one of his forerunners. Locke even approved corporal punishment against children's "Stubbornness" in his famous book Some Thoughts concerning Education (§ 78).

In this paper, the writer has attempted to reconsider a manslaughter case against a schoolmaster (Regina v.Hopley, 1860) by examining contemporary newspapers and educational journals. Through this research, he intends to clarify not only the incident itself but also public reactions and opinions for/against school corporal punishment. Regina v.Hopley had been regarded as an archtype of legal cases of school corporal punishment in commentaries on the laws of England, until school corporal punishment was abolished in 1987. But, curiously enough, the incident itself and contemporary reactions have never been brought to light even by D. P. Leinster-Mackay ( "Regina v Hopley : Some Historical Reflections on Corporal Punishment" Journal of Education Administration and History, vol. 9 , no.1 , 1977). Because of such absence of full investigative research, we often tended to consider Regina v. Hopley to have been only a trivial and minor matter for contemporary people. However, as the writer has provided a detailed picture on account of his investigation of local newspapers, the Hopley's incident was most sensational and caused a furor in England. Local newspapers enthusiastically reported the case in detail, and furthermore, submitted a profile of Hopley's career and their analyses of "The Eastbourne Tragedy". Now, we can list up The newspaper items the writer has referred to is as follows: 1 . The Lewes Times, Eastbourne Chronicle and Hailsham Observer. May 9 p. 1 & p.4 "Brutal Case of Manslaughter, by Beating" p.2 "A Schoolmaster Committed Manslaughter" May 16 p.1 "The Inquest on Mr. Hopley's Case. Mr. Hopley at the Inquest and before the Magistrates." May 23 p.1 "Mr.Thomas Hopley on the Wrongs which cry for Redress. Theory v. Practice" July 25 p.4 "Manslaughter Case, The Queen v. Hopley " 2 .The Sussex Advertiser, Surrey Gazette, and West Kent Courier. May 1 p.5 "Coroner's Inquest" May 8 p.4 "The Terrible Catastrophe at Eastbourne" p.7 "Committal of a Schoolmaster for Manslaughter, at Eastbourne" July 24 pp.3-5 "Trial of Mr. Hopley for Manslaughter" July 24 (Special Assize Edition) pp.2-3 "Trial of Mr.Hopley for Manslaughter" 3 . The Sussex Express, Surrey Standard, Herald of Kent Mail, and County Advertiser. April 28 pp.4-5 Article without captions begins: 'An inquest---'May 5 p.5 Article without captions begins: 'The greatest excitement---'May 5 p.6 "Alleged Death of a Pupil from Excessive Punishment at Eastbourne." July 24 pp.2-3 "The Eastbourne Tragedy. Trial of Thomas Hopley" July 28 p.6 "The Eastbourne Tragedy Concluded" 4 . The Brighton Observer, Fashionable Arrival List, and County Intelligencer. May 4 p.3 "A Brutal Affair" May 11 p.2 "The Eastbourne Tragedy" July 27 p.2 "The Eastbourne Tragedy" p.3 "Sussex Summer Assizes" 5 . Brighton Examiner, Fashionable Directory, Sussex County Journal, & Genaral Advertiser. May 8 p.3 "Charge of Manslaughter against a Schoolmaster" July 24 p.3 "The Eastbourne Manslaughter Case " July 31 p.2 "Corporal Punishment Furthermore, most of English and Scotch principal newspapers also reported the trial of Hopley (July 23, 1860) and made comments on the incident ; The Times, The Illustrated London News, Saturday Review, The Bristol Mercury, The Manchester Guardian, The Caledonian Mercury (Edingburgh), and so on.

In this paper, the writer has attempted to analyze the educational thought of Thomas Tryon (1634-1703) in order to clarify an aspect of the historical stream of European thought of embryo education. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, citing Varro's discourse, said such as the following : Educit obstetrix, dit Varron; educat nutrix, instituit poedagogus, docet magister. Ainsi l'education, l'institution, l'instruction, sont trois choses aussi differentes dans leur objet que la gouvernante, le precepteur et le maitre. This shows explicitly that the term "educacion" traditionally meant the action of midwives and nurses. "Education" did not mean school-instruction but "san-iku (bringing forth and breeding up)" (Kunio Yanagida). Accordingly, in the first place, the history of education must be a history of "saniku" which clarifies the historical transformation of "education". Furthermore, the crucial and critical field of such history, though it might sound strange, is the history of embryo education, because it comprises the overlapping field both of "san" and "iku". In fact, historical materials of embryo education consist of books for midwifery and child-rearing. However, at least to Japanese, European history of embryo education discourses has not been familiar. On the other hand, we have already had many informations on Japanese history of embryo education ("taikyo"). Therefore, in Japan, exsists a tendency to think that embryo education discourses exisist in Japan rather than in Europe. But, in this paper, the writer presents one of embryo education discourses in the 17th-century England as an example for embryo education in Europe. Thomas Tryon, a Pythagorean and vegetarian, published his book A New Method of Educating Children in 1695,which was read by John Locke too. This book on education began with his discourse on embryo education, which was founded on two premises : (1) The "Impressions" that women make, whilst they are pregnant and go with the child, have a wonderful "Influence" upon their issue. (2) There is a strong and unconceivable "Sympathy" between the mother and the child. Because of these premises, he had to submit the discourse on embryo education at first, proposing six dietetic advices, physical and mental, toward mothers. Of course, his dietetic advices which were based upon his The Way to Health functioned as a manual for mothers' self-fashioning, naturally stressing on the importance of female education. In Tryon's educational thought, embryo education was an archtype and a foundation of his whole thought of education, which represented European tradition of education.

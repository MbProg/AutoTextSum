Famous quotes containing the words killings, child and/or killers:
‚Äú¬ëI told him, Look at all those fightings and killings down there,
What¬ís the matter? Why don¬ít you put a stop to it?
¬ëI try, he said¬óThat¬ís all he could do, he looked tired. He¬ís a bachelor so long, and he likes lentil soup.¬í‚Äù
‚Äî Allen Ginsberg (b. 1926)
‚ÄúHaving children can smooth the relationship, too. Mother and daughter are now equals. That is hard to imagine, even harder to accept, for among other things, it means realizing that your own mother felt this way, too¬óunsure of herself, weak in the knees, terrified about what in the world to do with you. It means accepting that she was tired, inept, sometimes stupid; that she, too, sat in the dark at 2:00 A.M. with a child shrieking across the hall and no clue to the child¬ís trouble.‚Äù
‚Äî Anna Quindlen (20th century)
‚Äúwe want to remember when you were
money in Massachusetts and yet were wild and rude
and killers. We want our killers dressed in black
like grease for we are sick of writing checks,
putting on our socks and working in the little boxes
we call the office.‚Äù
‚Äî Anne Sexton (1928¬ñ1974)

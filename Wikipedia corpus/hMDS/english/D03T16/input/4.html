<td style="text-align:left;">Peter Connelly (also known as "Baby P", "Child A" and "Baby Peter") was an English 17-month old boy who died in London after suffering more than 50 injuries over an eight-month period, during which he was repeatedly seen by Haringey Children's services and NHS health professionals. Baby P's real first name was revealed as "Peter" on the conclusion of a subsequent trial of Peter's mother's boyfriend on a charge of raping a two-year-old. His full identity was revealed when his killers were named after the expiry of a court anonymity order on 10 August 2009. The case caused shock and concern among the public and in Parliament, partly because of the magnitude of Peter's injuries, and partly because Peter had lived in the London Borough of Haringey, North London, under the same child care authorities that had already failed ten years earlier in the case of Victoria Climbié. This had led to a public enquiry which resulted in measures being put in place in an effort to prevent similar cases happening.</td>

<td>Islington, London, England</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">Ben Michael Kinsella, was a 16-year-old English student at Holloway School. Kinsella was murdered by a gang of black men in Islington, London after an argument in which he was described as "blameless". The significant media attention around his murder (the 17th stabbing death of a teenager in London during 2008) led to a series of anti-knife crime demonstrations, a raised profile for the government's anti-knife crime maxim "Operation Blunt 2" and a review and change of UK knife crime sentencing laws.</td>

				<p id="quote_ext"><span class="quot">&ldquo;</span>Having children can smooth the relationship, too. Mother and daughter are now equals.

It means accepting that she was tired, inept, sometimes stupid; that she, too, sat in the dark at 2:00 A.M. with a <i>child</i> shrieking across the hall and no clue to the <i>child</i>&#146;s trouble.<span class="quot">&rdquo;</span><br>&mdash;<a href="/web/20160402122622/http://www.liquisearch.com/who_is_anna_quindlen" title="Who is Anna Quindlen?">Anna Quindlen</a> (20th century)</p>

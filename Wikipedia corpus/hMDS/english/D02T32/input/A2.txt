American pioneer group

Donner party, group of American pioneers stranded en route to California.
In late 1846, 87 immigrants led by George and Jacob Donner were trapped by heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada.
Fifteen of the group set out to find help.
When the others’ food ran out, they reportedly resorted to cannibalism of those already dead.
(After examining remains from the campsite, researchers in 2010 announced that they had been unable to find any human bones or other physical evidence of cannibalism.)
The 47 surviving members were rescued in February 1847.
Donner Lake and Donner Pass , Calif., are named for them.

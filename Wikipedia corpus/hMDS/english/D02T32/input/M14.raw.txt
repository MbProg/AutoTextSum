Donner party
George Donner leader of party: decided to take Lansford Hasting's cutoff (200 miles longer and went through salt marsh desert) = Lansford Hasting was never actually on cutoff.
Truckee Lake (now known as the Donner lake) got to lake (Sierra Nevada mountains) when worst snow storm in California's history hit that night. didn't stop snowing for 2 months. (less than 100 miles away from safety at Sutter's fort) lake= camp for winter. had to eat the dead to survive.
Forlorn Hope sent 15 people to get help while rest of party waited at lake. they got lost and resorted to cannibalism. only one of 15 Forlorn Hope people made it to Sutter's fort and back
what did this do to the Westward movement? this caused decline in Westward Movement=people heard about the Donner party and had doubts about journey.
how many people survived? 2/3 of women and children lived, 2/3 of men died. 46-87 survived
who was Lansford Hasting found a cutoff through mountains. had never actually been on cutoff but still paid people to go on it

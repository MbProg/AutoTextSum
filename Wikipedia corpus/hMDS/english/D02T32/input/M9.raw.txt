A question for our learned Mormon posters here at C-D: does the LDS Church hold any special appreciation for the Donner Party, the group of "settlers" who crossed the continent in 1846 on a journey to the "Great West?" The Donners are of course most famous for getting snow-bound in the Sierra mountain in California and resorting to cannibalism to survive as they wintered down in the snow.
(Quick disclosure: my thread is not to talk about cannibalism, as this obviously has nothing to do with Mormons).
We know that the Donner Party spent 30 days in the Wasatch Mountains, just east of present day Saly lake City, cutting a very difficult trail through the mountains to get their wagons through. We also know that the Mormons, the very next Spring, followed this cut trail through the Wasatch, immediately before arriving to the Great Salt Plain that spread out before them. Apparently Bringham Young liked the location!
So do Mormons teach anything about the Donners in their sunday school classes? Are there any monuments at the big LDS church in SLC? What's the relation?

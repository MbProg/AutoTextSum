Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act - Scientology and The Alaska Mental Health Bill - Conspiracy Theories
Conspiracy Theories
In Ron's Journal 67, Hubbard identified "the people behind the Siberia Bill ", who he asserted were
less than twelve men.
They are members of the Bank of England and other higher financial circles.
They own and control newspaper chains, and they are, oddly enough, directors in all the mental health groups in the world which have sprung up.
Now these chaps are very interesting fellows: They have fantastically corrupt backgrounds; illegitimate children; government graft; a very unsavory lot.
And they apparently, sometime in the rather distant past, had determined on a course of action.
Being in control of most of the gold supplies of the planet, they entered upon a program of bringing every government to bankruptcy and under their thumb, so that no government would be able to act politically without their permission.
According to David Miscavige, the bill was the product of a conspiracy by the American Psychiatric Association.
In a public address in 1995, he told Scientologists that it was "in 1955 that the agents for the American Psychiatric Association met on Capitol Hill to ram home the infamous Siberia Bill , calling for a secret concentration camp in the wastes of Alaska."
It was "here that Mr. Hubbard, as the leader of a new and dynamic religious movement, knocked that Siberia Bill right out of the ring â€” inflicting a blow they would never forget."
The assertion that Scientologists defeated the bill is made frequently in Scientology literature.
In fact, the original version of the bill with the offending Title I commitment provisions only passed the House of Representatives; it was subsequently amended in conference to strike the commitment portion and retain the transfer of responsibility for mental health care.
The revised bill passed easily without further changes.

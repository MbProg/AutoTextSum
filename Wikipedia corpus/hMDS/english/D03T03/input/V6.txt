The Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act controversy
by Graham
Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Mental_Health_Enabling_Act
Today, in the process of researching something, I landed on Wikipedia to find this fascinating story highlighted about the Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act .
The controversy over this legislation is notable for the various groups that made common cause to oppose it, and the tactics that they used in the process.
Also notable was how the intent of the act was subverted after its passing, as susccessive Alaska administrations attempted (successfully) to starve the program of resources, until they were forced to wind back the cut-backs by the Alaska Supreme Court.
An example of a higher judicial body actually intervening correctly to turn back political subversion.
The most fascinating part of the story is the involvement of the Church of Scientology.
As the article makes clear, they were initially nowhere to be found, even though they now pretend that they were opposed to the legislation all along.
It seems that a major plank of their anti-psychology worldview is based on what happened in the Alaska situation.
Reading this story today, I am struck by the parallels between the tactics of the opponents, and some of the tactics being used today by religious groups and even the current Administration, where they quite cheerfully deploy all types of fallacious reasoning to justify nonsensical ideas and policies.
More on this later when I have the time.

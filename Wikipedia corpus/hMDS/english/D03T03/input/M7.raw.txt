The Siberia Bill

That interview can be found on Youtube. I was curious about this bill that was before Congress in 1956. This has some pretty interesting facts about the Bill and $cientology's crazy stance on it:

I still find it hard to believe that I once considered myself a member of this ridiculous nut-job "church" and believed that everything that the great LRH said was the gospel truth.

ASU board deserves scrutiny
Gerald L.K. Smith, the founder of the Eureka Springs Passion Play and the Christ of the Ozarks, was a notorious anti-Semite according to the Anti-Defamation League.
He was a member of William Dudley Pelley's pro-Nazi Silver Shirts organization, which was patterned after Hitler's brown shirts.
He was convicted under the U.S. Alien Enemies Act.
He lobbied for decades for the release of all Nazi war criminals convicted at the Nuremberg Trials.
In 1956, Smith joined a campaign against the Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act, and denounced it as being part of a communist plot to hospitalize and brainwash Americans.
Glen Jeansonne wrote a biography of Smith entitled "Gerald L. K. Smith: Minister of Hate."
If I lived in Eureka Springs, I sure as hell wouldn't want to be associated with anything Gerald Smith created.

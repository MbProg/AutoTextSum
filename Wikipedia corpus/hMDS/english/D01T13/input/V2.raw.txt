Looks like you didn't have the greatest light. I took the liberty of bringing out a few details.

In PSP X34, I used the fill light/clarity slider to brighten the structure. Next, I went into Topaz Adjust, where any number of presets will create a more pleasing image. I don't know exactly which one I used, but here's another, using spicify, lowering the opacity of the layer about 50%.
You would have had better results if you had been there at a better time of day.

Indonesian police have been put on alert at the Borobudur Temple after a threat against the world’s biggest Buddhist temple and UNESCO World heritage Site was made on Facebook by Islamic State supporters.

The threat was posted on a Facebook account under the title ‘We   Are Islamic State’ – apparently the one of Islamic State   (formerly known as ISIS) followers – on August 15.
It read, “God willing, [Borobudur] will be demolished by   Islamic caliphate mujahidin!”
Tightening security around Borobudur was not the only measure   taken, as police in Central Java province also begun thoroughly   searching through data from the Internet for possible clues about   the plan, National Police spokesman Ronny F. Sompie told the Jakarta Post on Friday.
“The Central Java Police chief has ordered an investigation   into the threat and we expect that there will be cooperation with   the temple’s security personnel and the Indonesian Military [TNI]   to safeguard the temple from any possible damage,” he said   in the capital city of Jakarta.
Following the reports of the threat, Borobudur Conservation   Agency had prepared for the imminent bombing with increased   number of security personnel within and around the temple, said   the head of the agency, Marsis Sutopo.
“We’ve increased the number of security officers and have   coordinated with PT Taman Wisata Candi Borobudur [TWCB, which   manages tourism activities at the temple] and the local   police,” he said on Friday in Magelang.
The Indonesian army has also been involved.
Earlier this week,   commander of the Diponegoro Military Command, operating in two   Java districts, Major-General Sunindyo confirmed readiness to   back up security around the temple.
Built in Central Java in the IX century, Borobudur is known as   the largest and one of the most important Buddhist monuments in   the world.
It was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in   1991, after major renovation works.
With over 500 Buddha statues,   it serves not only as a key tourist attraction in Indonesia, but   also as a pilgrimage site for Mahayana Buddhists from all over   the world.
It is not the first time Borobudur has become the target of an   attack in an archipelago nation with a Muslim majority and six   official religions recognized.
It was bombed in 1985, when nine of the stupas at Borobudur were   damaged.
Three Muslim radicals were held responsible for the   attack.
In August last year security in Borobudur – as well as in other   Java places of worship – was similarly tightened due to the   bombing of the Buddhist temple Ekayana Graha Vihara in Jakarta.

      <p><b><font size=+2 face="Arial">Lessons of the Irish Hunger Strikes - Part 
        1</font></b> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Near the Beechmount area, in Belfast’s Falls 
        Road, there is a mural of the ten prisoners who died in the 2nd great 
        hunger strike of 1981. What strikes you, as you approach from afar, is 
        the beaming smiles they share.&nbsp; The subliminal message is that they 
        would have approved the outcome that we live in today.&nbsp; Inevitably 
        there is a battle about who inherits the mantle of the hunger strikes 
        and about the interpretation of their significance.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many years after the hunger strikes, in 
        the later phases of the implementation of the good Friday agreement, the 
        first shot was fired in that battle. A local luminary in West Belfast 
        who was both a member of Sinn Fein and a strong supporter of the agreement, 
        remarked that the hunger strikers has died of because they lacked negotiating 
        skills.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The resulting fury was quickly glossed over 
        by the republicans, but in fact the remark was indicative of a commonplace 
        view - that behind the hunger strike was a hidden battle of diplomacy 
        between Irish nationalism and the British. It's a view that justifies 
        and underpins a whole secret history of the hunger strike which eventually 
        led Sinn Fein first to capitulate to Irish nationalism and the church 
        and then, in alliance with the nationalists, reach an accommodation with 
        imperialism.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another view, perhaps the most widespread, 
        views the hunger strike as essentially an act of heroism and the struggle 
        as essentially the continuation of a military conflict between the IRA 
        and the British.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a further, forgotten view. This 
        was that, although the hunger strike was at the centre of the struggle, 
        its essential dynamic was mass struggle - the mobilisation and organisation 
        of a significant section of the Irish population, attempting to broaden 
        out its base to the point where the majority of the Irish population mobilized 
        against the British and called into action working-class support around 
        the globe.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Within this mass campaign was hidden critical 
        class tensions.&nbsp; The struggle could either shift to the left and 
        move into conflict with Irish capital and its policy of collaboration 
        with capitalism or it could shift right, join with the capitalist parties 
        and seek an accommodation with imperialism.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This forgotten history of mass and class 
        struggle is important.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It’s important because it both explains 
        the history of the hunger strike within a wider struggle and links the 
        strike to the reality of people’s everyday lives. Joining in the campaign 
        was not simply an act of solidarity.&nbsp; It was an act of self-defence 
        – an attempt to push back a British offensive that was never meant simply 
        to attack prisoners but also to silence mass struggle and delegitimise 
        resistance to British rule.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This history situates the hunger strike 
        within the ebb and flow of earlier struggles within the 30 years of the 
        troubles and identifies it as a decisive moment when the maximum weight 
        available to the republican milieu was locked in a decisive battle with 
        the full force of British imperialism.&nbsp; The battle cost Britain a 
        great deal, but at the end imperialism still stood and the mass movement 
        was dispersed and demobilised.&nbsp; What was left was electoral gains 
        for Sinn Fein – a pale shadow of the energy, organisation and consciousness 
        there before. This was all the more so as Sinn Fein at the end of the 
        hunger strike had already applied to be junior partner to the nationalist 
        family and was moving steadily to the right.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When we understand this we see the link 
        between the hunger strikes and the Good Friday agreement. The hunger strike 
        campaign was the maximum that the republicans could muster.&nbsp; They 
        had already abandoned the inflated claims of militarism by recognising 
        that IRA actions had no real place in the campaign. A movement, supposedly 
        with the power to force Britain out of Ireland, was unable to change British 
        policy on prisoners. In fact, armed actions would have to be suppressed 
        to build the movement. The mass movement that was built was enough to 
        damage the British and make it worthwhile to make some concessions to 
        the republicans but insufficient to win, to force the British back.&nbsp; 
        When Sinn Fein and the IRA faced up to that reality and began a process 
        of secret diplomacy with the church and Fianna Fail they broke with their 
        tradition of irreconcilable opposition to imperialism and adopted a policy 
        of accommodation and reform.&nbsp; Defeated in their attempt to build 
        revolution, they were equally unable to win genuine reform.&nbsp; The 
        outcome was the solution favoured by Irish capital – an undemocratic settlement 
        that aimed for stability.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A class history of the Hunger strike is 
        important above all because it points a way forward.&nbsp; The radicalism 
        of the H-block movement tended to stop at the border.&nbsp; In elections 
        we asked southern workers if we could borrow their vote and abstained 
        on all the issues directly affecting them.&nbsp; Not surprisingly we got 
        mass sympathy but only a limited direct support. A new starting point 
        is to rebuild the self-organisation of the masses and this can only be 
        done if we appeal above all to the working class.&nbsp; The Good Friday 
        agreement is the outcome of defeat.&nbsp; It represents the interests 
        of imperialism and capitalism.&nbsp; A new resistance will be built by 
        opposing the agreement, by adopting the irreconcilable support for democracy 
        and opposition to imperialism represented by the old demand “Smash Stormont” 
        and by ruling out any front with an Irish capital which shows itself both 
        unable to support genuine democracy and all too willing to further exploit 
        and divide the Irish working class in the interests of imperialism.</font>

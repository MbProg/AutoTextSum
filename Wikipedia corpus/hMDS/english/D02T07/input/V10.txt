Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator threatening Hillary Clinton’s bid for the White House, made a direct plea to Margaret Thatcher on behalf of the IRA hunger strikers, The Daily Telegraph can disclose.
Sanders made his plea in July 1981 while serving as mayor of Burlington, the town where he forged his political reputation, as recorded in his political archive held by the University of Vermont.

Papers also reveal the strong influence the Irish Republican movement had in the town during the 1980s, at the height of the Troubles.
The IRA hunger strikes were the culmination of a five-year protest by convicted paramilitary prisoners, which culminated in the death of 10 inmates.
Sanders wrote two months after the death of hunger striker Bobby Sands: “We are deeply disturbed by your government’s unwillingness to stop the abuse, humiliation and degrading treatment of Irish prisoners now on hunger strikes in Northern Ireland.”
The letter was co-signed by Terry Bouricius, a Burlington alderman, and sent on July 15 1981.
“We ask you to end your intransigent policy towards the prisoners before the reputation of the English people for fair play and simple decency is further damaged in the eyes of the people of Vermont and the United States.”
Britain’s involvement in Northern Ireland was hugely controversial in the US, where Irish descendents wielded considerable political influence.
Even though they carried less sway in Vermont than states such as Massachusetts further to the south, pro-Irish activism remained powerful.
Only two days before the letter was sent, Burlington aldermen were addressed by Fergus O’Hare, a civil rights activist who won a Belfast council seat at the expense of Gerry Fitt, from the moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party.
A resolution backing the demands of H Block prisoners was not put to the meeting.
Sanders, however, was quoted in the local press, saying: “I am delighted to have a member of the Belfast City Council coming here.”

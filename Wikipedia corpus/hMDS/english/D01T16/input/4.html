        face="Verdana">That morning in October, 1986, as the
        police officer from India, under training at the
        Bramshill, was passing through the huge chapel drawing
        room, he came across an area where he smelt a fragrance,
        pleasing and soft. He stopped there. There was no doubt
        the fragrance was there. He stepped aside a few steps.
        There was no trace of any fragrance then. He walked back
        into the area in front of the cushioned chairs, to find
        again that it held the scent. He decided to experiment
        and discover the source.He eyed the flower pots on the
        windows, and went up to them and put his nose to the
        plants. He sniffed under the sofa-sets and below the
        centre table, behind the curtains and under the carpet.
        The scent that had filled his nostrils earlier was to be
        detected nowhere else except in a small area facing the
        cushioned chairs. In fact, he could step in and out of
        the smell from that area. However, when he walked into
        this area the sixth time and thereafter, the fragrance
        had gone, as if the invisible source had moved away! The
        thought that it might have been a spirit made the hair on
        the back of his back bristle.</font><p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana">The Chief Superintendent volunteered the
        information that the Bramshill House was haunted by no
        less than 14 spirits and that the most important feature
        of the White Lady was that she announced her presence
        with a strong floral fragrance, the smell of the arum
        lilies or the lily-of-the-valley.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Bramshill is
        magnificent Jacobean mansion built in the earlier part of
        the 17th century by Edward Lord Zouche, of Gray&#146;s
        lnn. It was intended to be used as royal palace by Henry,
        son of James I. Young Henry died of typhoid before the
        work could be completed in 1625, thereby associating the
        house with tragedy from the very beginning. However, the
        present mansion is built on the site which had buildings
        of the 14th century. Today, only an ancient gateway and a
        part of the cellar of an earlier building remains.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since the completion of
        the mansion, it has had a succession of private owners.
        The longest continuous period under one owner was from
        1699 to 1935 when it was owned by eight generations of
        the Cope family. In 1953, the mansion was acquired by the
        Home Office for housing Britain&#146;s Police College.
        The area is spread over several hundred acres, and one is
        captivated by the grandeur of the palace situated in
        idyllic surroundings.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The story of the White
        Lady is fascinating and tragic. It is said to be the
        spirit of a young bride who, married on a Christmas eve,
        played the game of hide-and-seek with her husband and
        guests. She hid herself somewhere, and was nowhere to be
        found. Fifty years later, her skeleton was discovered,
        still clothed in its bridal gown and with a sprig of
        mistletoe in her skeletal hand, from inside an old large
        wooden chest. Having climbed into the chest to hide, the
        spring-lock had snapped shut, entombing her for 50 years.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The mistletoe-bough
        chest, Italian in origin, is displayed in the
        Bramshill&#146;s reception hall. One legend has it that
        when the chest was in Italy, Genevre Orsini, who was 15,
        had suffered the ghastly fate described above in 1727.
        And when the carved Italian chest was imported by the
        fifth Baronet Cope, Genevre&#146;s ghost was imported,
        too.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She wanders in the
        mansion, sad-faced, favouring the Long Gallery, the Fleur
        de Lys room and the area around the chest.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">During the 1930s, young
        Joan Penelope Cope and her brother often awoke to find
        the White Lady by their bedside. The family of King
        Michael of Romania, which stayed at the Bramshill from
        1950 to 1952, felt the presence of the White Lady. His
        queen saw &#145;her&#146; sitting in the King&#146;s
        room. An exorcism had had no effect.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Samuel Rogers describes
        the White Lady thus in his poem:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Oh! Sad was her
        fate! In sportive jest,</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She hid from her Lord in
        the old oak chest.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It closed with a spring
        and her bridal bloom,</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lay withering there in a
        living tomb.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yet another ghost, the
        Grey Lady, so named because of her grey coloured robe, is
        said to be the ghost of one of the members of the Cope
        family. She has auburn hair and is dressed in a straight,
        sleeveless robe. One story has it that her husband, a
        dissenter, was brought to the Bramshill in the early 17th
        century, where he was interrogated, summarily tried and
        immediately thereafter beheaded. She now wanders through
        the mansion in search of him. The &#145;husband of the
        Grey Lady&#146; has also been felt. The &#145;son of the
        Grey Lady&#146; too is heard crying from the pre-Jacobean
        cellars.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then, there is the
        ghostly &#145;Green Man&#146;, seen in the vicinity of
        the fresh water-lake, some times standing on the little
        bridge near the Tudor gatehouse. It is said to be the
        ghost of a member of the Cope family who drowned in the
        lake in 1806. At the time of the death, he was dressed in
        green from head to knee. From knee down-wards, he wore
        black boots &#151; and so, he is seen as legless against
        the dark background.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In 1976, a security
        officer on night patrol encountered a ghost, believed to
        be Ronald, the son of the Bramshill&#146;s last private
        owner Lord Brocket. Ronald had died in tragic
        circumstances 30 years back. At the time he was sighted
        the young man&#146;s ghost was in tennis gear and
        carrying a racket.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The panelled hall with
        the mistletoe bough chest is haunted by the ghost of old
        man with a long beard, and the chapel drawing room by the
        ghost of a woman from the days of Queen Anne. There is an
        adjoining room with the lady ghost in a tight bodice and
        a full skirt. A bedroom upstairs is haunted by an
        invisible presence where a child&#146;s tiny hand is some
        times placed in the hands of a visitor.One room on the
        first floor has ghostly forms that float two feet above
        the floor level. It is an interesting fact that this
        particular floor was lowered during structural
        alterations, and it would appear that the ghosts walk at
        the same level where they had walked earlier.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is also a path in
        the grounds of the Bramshill haunted by &#145;the
        Gardener&#146;, who was drowned in a lake in the
        north-west side. Dogs smell something as soon as they
        come to the tunnel formed by the intertwining branches of
        overgrown trees, and avoid going through the tunnel.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In 1972, a college
        security officer saw from the hall a man in a grey
        flannel suit on the path outside, walking towards the
        mansion. The man came in through the open door, crossed
        the hall and went straight through the wall opposite, not
        to reappear. The part of the wall through which the man
        had walked, there used to be an archway, which had been
        blocked and plastered years ago.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The terrace, with its
        loggias and elegant bay windows with balustrades, is
        haunted by a mysterious woman in white. She appeared
        dramatically one evening in front of Sir William Cope and
        his family. As the butler approached the figure, it
        seemed to melt into the balustrade.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are other stories
        of strange happenings in the house. No wonder, the
        Bramshill is known as the &#145;most haunted house in
        Hampshire&#146;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Significantly, all but
        one of the ghosts &#151; the exception being the Gardener
        &#151; are &quot;friendly&quot;, or more appropriately,
        not harmful to those who experience them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The College Secretariat
        keeps a &#145;ghost file&#146; &#151; a file on ghosts
        &#151; which meticulously records encounters of all
        ghosts sighted in and around the house. If happen to
        visit the Bramshill and have a &#145;ghostly&#146;
        experience, do not forget to have your experience entered
        in the &quot;ghost file&quot;.</font></p>

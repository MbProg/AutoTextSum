Date 1596. — This chamber adjoins the Drawing-room before described, <br />
and is eighteen feet square in its dimension. The walls are panelled <br />
with oak. The Chimney-piece is equally elegant in its design with that <br />
of the drawing-room, and is engraved amongst the illustrations to the <br />
Account of the House by Mr. Palmer. The carvings shown on this <br />
Plate, represent the central and one of the side panels of the entabla- <br />
ture over the lower columns of the chimney-piece. Both consist of a <br />
scroll and strap pattern, in which bunches of fruits are introduced. <br />

Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury, daughter of John Hardwick, Esq. <br />
This lady had been married twice before she became the wife of the <br />
Earl of Shrewsbury, first to Robert Bailey, Esq. and Sir WiUiam <br />
Cavendish, and it was not till after the death of her first two husbands, <br />
that she erected this stately edifice. There are very few mansions like <br />
Hardwick, which give so clear and complete an idea of the architec- <br />
tural taste of the times in which it was built ; and by the singular o-ood <br />
taste of the possessors, it has been suffered to remain in its primitive state, <br />
with much of the ancient furniture, to this day. Over this Chimney- <br />
piece in the Great Hall, is a beautiful arabesque compartment of very <br />
large size, in which is fully displayed the armorial achievement of the <br />
Countess of Shrewsbury ; the lozenge-formed shield is charged with a <br />
saltier engrailed, and in chief three roses, her paternal arms of Hard- <br />
wick, as now quartered by the present Duke ; the supporters are two <br />
hinds, each collared, the whole painted and emblazoned. In the Great <br />
Hall is the history of Patient Grizel, in old tapestry, and in the gallery <br />
is a very curious collection of portraits of distinguished characters. <br />
<br />
Plate XXIX. The principal Elevation of Bramshill House, in <br />
Hampshire, the Seat of Sir John Cope, Bart. Date 1603. — ^Brams- <br />
hill House is in the parish of Eversley, on the borders of Berkshire and <br />
Surrey, at a short distance from Hartford Bridge : its situation is open <br />
and commanding, and as a specimen of Elizabethan architecture, merits <br />
particular attention, exhibiting all the stateliness for wliich the period <br />
referred to was remarkable, with a suite of apartments both large and <br />
lofty. The amplitude of its dimensions indicate a princely residence, <br />
and it is traditionally reported to have been erected for the highlv <br />
accomplished and amiable Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES. 35 <br />
<br />
eldest son of King James I. who died at the age of eighteen, in the <br />
year 1612. Bramshill House was the residence of Edward, Lord <br />
Zouch, of Harringworth, a nobleman highly favoured by King James, <br />
who appointed him Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Constable <br />
of Dover Castle. <br />
<br />
Bramshill Park is not large, but there is an historical anecdote con- <br />
nected with it, which gives the spot some interest. Dr. George Abbot, <br />
Archbishop of Canterbury, who took an active part in all the great <br />
transactions of state, when in a declining state of health, used in the <br />
summer to retire into Hampshire for the sake of recreation, and had <br />
accepted an invitation from Lord Zouch to hunt the fallow deer in his <br />
park at Bramshill. During the enjoyment of his sport, he one day <br />
accidentally killed that nobleman's keeper by an arrow from a crossbow, <br />
which he had aimed at one of the herd. This misfortune threw the <br />
Archbishop into a deep melancholy, and the prelate ever afterwards <br />
kept a monthly fast on Tuesday, the day on which this fatal accident <br />
happened. The Archbishop's conduct was submitted to inquiry, but it <br />
did not lessen him in the King's favour, who observed, " that an angel <br />
might have miscarried in this sort," and accordingly his Majesty granted <br />
him pardon, and declared him still capable of all the authority of a <br />
primate. <br />
<br />
In the reign of Charles I. Bramshill House was partly destroyed by <br />
fire, a circumstance which is noticed by Fuller. In 1673, it was the <br />
residence of Sir Andrew Henley, Bart., but has been for a considerable <br />
time the property of the family of the present possessor, one of which <br />
built the mansion at Kensington, now called Holland House. <br />
<br />
Plate XXX. The Oriel Window in the Western Elevation of <br />
Bramshill House, in Hampshire. Date 1603. — In the architecture of <br />
Bramshill House, is to be observed the attempt at Italian improvement, <br />
then newly introduced. The main building, three stories in height and <br />
about one hundred and forty feet in extent, is constructed with brick, <br />
with stone dressings to the numerous large and lofty windows ; the <br />
quoins also are of stone, and the whole is surmounted by an open <br />
carved parapet of the same material. The central compartment of the <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
36 ELIZABETHAN ARCHITECTURE. <br />
<br />
principal front, about twenty feet in width, is built wholly with stone, <br />
and displays a profusion of ornamental decoration, including the very <br />
fine Oriel Window shown on the Plate. This portion of the building, <br />
an interesting architectural specimen, is earned up with terminal pilasters <br />
of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian style, from story to story, and is <br />
surmounted by a florid pediment which is perforated. <br />
<br />
The Oriel, or compas Window, in the centre of the front, is sin- <br />
gularly beautiful in design, with much lightness and elegance in its <br />
details. This species of window is one of the most ornamental features <br />
in the exterior of a building, and equally cheerful in the interior. In <br />
the instance here given, the beauty of its proportions renders it an <br />
example particularly worthy of attention. <br />
<br />
Plate XXXI. The Elevation of the Eastern Side of Bramshill <br />
House, in Hampshire. Date 1603,— This front towards the east, <br />
exhibits comparatively little ornament, but shows that general unifor- <br />
mity in design was preserved, even although it was necessary for <br />
internal convenience to vary the situation and size of particular <br />
windows. In the centre of this front is a bold projection, in which is <br />
the arch of entrance, and above it a bay window. This projection, like <br />
the rest of the building, is crowned with an ornamental pierced parapet, <br />
and the whole is surmounted by a large gable, containing a recessed <br />
niche and statue of King James I. This front is about one hundred <br />
and twenty-four feet in extent, and two stories in height, <br />
<br />
Plate XXXII. The Elevation of the Southern Side of Bramshill <br />
House, in Hampshire. Date 1603. — The extent of this front is about <br />
one hundred and ninety-three feet, and in height, to the top of the <br />
parapet, forty-six feet : its principal feature, and most important dif- <br />
ference from the other fronts of this noble building, is a terrace twenty- <br />
five feet in width between the projecting wings, a kind of architectural <br />
fore-ground to the garden, which is extremely beautiful. The terrace is <br />
bounded by a balustrade, and the general effect is very striking. <br />

Plate XXXIII. Balustrades, from the Deanerij at Lincoln, and <br />
<br />
from Bramshill House. Date 1603.— The first subject of this Plate <br />
<br />
is a very beautiful crest or ornamental parapet of the Deanery House <br />
<br />
at Lincoln, rising three feet above the building, constructed about the <br />
<br />
same period as Bramshill House. <br />
<br />
The second example shown is the pierced parapet, which crowns <br />
the whole of the house at Bramshill. The height of the parapet is <br />
three feet seven inches, and the small piers, about fourteen inches in <br />
width, are about four feet five inches distant from each other : the effect <br />
of the pierced work between them is very fine: a more light and <br />
elegant parapet is rarely found, even in the compositions of the best <br />
Italian architects. The parapet, a great improvement to the elevation, <br />
is an architectural feature that in the Elizabethan era was much varied, <br />
but for simplicity of design it would be difficult to produce a finer <br />
instance. <br />
<br />
The balusters of the terrace at Bramshill, which form the remaining <br />
example, are excellent in their proportions, and well adapted to the <br />
purpose for which they are applied. The height of the balustrade is <br />
three feet three inches. <br />
<br />
Plate XXXIV. The Arcade at Bramshill House, in Hampshire. <br />
Date 1603.— The Arcade on the terrace of the southern front is here <br />
shown : it is a feature of domestic architecture, borrowed from Italy, <br />
where the terrace answered the purpose of exercise, and became an <br />
important accessory to every villa. In the present design, it may be <br />
objected by the classical architect that the imposts of the arches rest <br />
upon the pillars, and convey an appearance of instability. This idea <br />
has been combated by Mr. Woods, in his " Letters of an Architect," <br />
who admits that the judgment does not easily reconcile itself to arches <br />
upon columns or on posts, for a column is only an ornamented stone <br />
post, but he confesses that there is a delightful hghtness and airiness <br />
of effect produced by the distribution, difficult to be obtained by other <br />
means. The enrichments of the arcade at Bramshill are extremely <br />
pleasing. The order intended is Doric ; but in this instance it is made <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
to assume all the lightness of the Ionic : the trigh-phs and ornamented <br />
metopes, together with the simple capitals of the columns, are the only <br />
distinctions by which the identity of the order is determined. <br />
<br />
Plate XXXV. The Stone Screen in the Hall at Bramshill House, <br />
in Hampshire. Date 1603.— The Screen, at the lower end of the <br />
ancient halls, was a necessary arrangement, to mask the entrances from <br />
the offices, and much embellishment was usually lavished upon it. In <br />
ruder times it was customary to inscribe this part of the mansion with <br />
notices of invitation and welcome to the hospitality then ostentatiously <br />
exhibited; as at Halnaker House, in Sussex, now belonging to the <br />
Duke of Richmond, where the doors are labelled with the words, " Le <br />
Bien Venue," and " Come in and drinke," coarsely carved. The screen <br />
at Bramshill bears numerous shields, seemingly intended for emblazon- <br />
ment of the arms of the neighbouring gentry, who might be welcome to <br />
the spread of good cheer inseparable from the domestic establishment <br />
of a large mansion. The simple inscription at Montacute House, in <br />
Somersetshire, " And yours, my friends," answered the same benevo- <br />
lent purpose as the emblazoned frieze at GilHng Castle, where the <br />
members of every division of the county of York are separately distin- <br />
guished by their family insignia. The height of the screen in the hall <br />
at Bramshill is thirteen feet, and the depth of the entablature, con- <br />
taining a double row of sculptured shields, is two feet six inches. In <br />
the spandrils of the arches are introduced small female figures, one in <br />
each, emblematical of Justice and Wisdom, Industry and Plenty. The <br />
order intended in this enriched portion of the hall is Corinthian ; but the <br />
architectural features are so modified by the exuberance of decoration <br />
as to be scarcely perceptible. A section of the Screen is given on the <br />
same Plate, by which its relative thickness may be determined ; and in <br />
the details the arabesque ornaments of the sculptured shields are shown <br />
at laro;e. <br />

<br />
chamber, into which the company retired, sometimes called the drawing- <br />
room, a name abbreviated from withdrawing room : the phrase is <br />
generally supposed to be of more modern date ; but in the age of <br />
Elizabeth, Whetstone, in his Heptameron says, " The queene sent for <br />
the chosen company who were placed in the drawinge chamber :" <br />
proving the use of the term, even before the torrent of puritanical zeal <br />
had subdued ancient splendour, and French taste had been introduced <br />
in the reig-n of Charles II. <br />
<br />
The drawing-room at Bramshill is lighted by four bay windows of <br />
different sizes ; and to its whole height, about sixteen feet, is panelled <br />
with oak, the ribs or styles being carved, and the surface of the panel <br />
left plain. The frieze is a beautiful design of a running pattern of <br />
foliage and fruit, which is shown at large on the next Plate, together <br />
with the mouldings and size of the panels. The richness occasioned by <br />
the variations from uniformity of surface in these large rooms is very <br />
striking. <br />
<br />
Plate XXXVII. The Details at large of the Drawing-room and <br />
Library at Bramshill House, Hampshire. Date 1603. — The first <br />
subject of this Plate is one of the upper panels of the Drawing-room, <br />
surmounted by its beautiful Corinthian entablature, in the frieze of <br />
which are introduced the fig, the grape, and the pomegranate, each <br />
with its appropriate foliage and blossoms ; the architrave rests on den- <br />
tils, and the frieze is overshadowed by a bold modillioned cornice <br />
slightly enriched with carving. <br />
<br />
One of the lower panels, part of the dado in the same room, is <br />
also shown on this Plate, with a section of the projecting mouldings. <br />
The upper panel is two feet ten inches, by two feet four inches in <br />
dimension ; the lower, two feet seven inches, by two feet six inches. <br />
<br />
The plaster frieze in the Library, of a very elegant arabesque <br />
pattern, quite in the Florentine taste, is nineteen inches in width. The <br />
workmanship is excellent, and shows the great perfection the art of <br />
plastering had attained. <br />

Plate XXXVIII. Ceilings at Bramshill House, in Hampshire. <br />
Bate 1603.— The Ceilings at Bramshill are not less characteristic of <br />
the Elizabethan period than the other architectural parts of the man- <br />
sion ; those of the old Library and Drawing-room have been selected <br />
as excellent examples, and it is not often that such fine specimens <br />
have been preserved. The designs, which aiford a pleasing variety, <br />
are so well arranged, that but Httle of the plain surface is left, and the <br />
compositions, abundantly ornamented, are managed with all the skill <br />
necessary to produce a light and elegant effect. <br />
<br />
Plate XXXIX. The Chimney-piece in the Drawing-room at <br />
Bramshill House, in Hampshire. Date 1603. — The massive appear- <br />
ance of this Chimney-piece is not injudiciously contrasted with the <br />
lighter panelling and richly worked ceiling of the same apartment : it <br />
is altogether executed in a more solid and less ornamental style of art. <br />
The design is classical, and after the manner . of Vignola : it compre- <br />
hends two stories in height; the lower being Doric, and the upper <br />
Ionic. The distribution of the members is pure and regular; the <br />
columns, with their capitals and entablature, are well suited to each <br />
other, and the whole is surmounted by a sculptured pediment, which <br />
lises to the cornice of the room. The shafts of the columns are of <br />
variegated marble ; and the upper compartment of the chimney-piece <br />
is composed of separate pieces of the same diversified material, disposed <br />
in a manner rather formal, over the surface. The frieze of the upper <br />
order is also formed of coloured marble in the centre ; and over the <br />
columns, the entablature is broken, which considerably relieves the <br />
effect, and preserves the appearance of solidity produced by the bold <br />
relief given to the several parts. The basement seems almost too low <br />
for the order above it. The fire-place, six feet in width, is four feet <br />
eight inches high, and retains the ancient andirons, or dogs, used for <br />
burnmg wood : these are of the larger sort, and are much ornamented, <br />
particularly at the low^er part. A profile of the projection of the <br />
Chimney-piece is shown on the Plate. <br />

Plate XL. The Side of the Drawing-room at Stockton House, in <br />
Wiltshire, the Seat of Harry Biggs, Esq. Date 1610. — Stockton <br />
House is situated in a deep valley on the banks of the river Wily, which <br />
joins the Nadder, and forms an important branch of the upper Avon ; it <br />
is about six miles north-eastward from the town of Hindon, near the <br />
beautiful downs for which its vicinity is celebrated. The mansion was <br />
built about the year 1610, by John Topp, Esq., one of the ancestors of <br />
Francis Topp, who was created Baronet by King Charles II. in 1688. <br />
The Drawing-room may be pronounced one of the best examples of <br />
interior decoration in the Elizabethan style now remaining in Wiltshire, <br />
and the more iiiteresting from the very excellent preservation in which <br />
its ornamental features are carefully maintained. <br />
<br />
In length this beautiful apartment is thirty-three feet eight inches, <br />
and in breadth, exclusive of a large oriel at the upper end, it is twenty <br />
feet two inches : in height the room is not more than eleven feet. It is <br />
situated in one of the angles of the mansion, and is lighted on two of its <br />
sides by large bay windows. The oriel, or deep recess, at the upper <br />
end of the room, is above eight feet square, and the bays of its fine <br />
transom window contain some armorial compartments in stained glass. <br />
The chimney-piece, shown in the plate, is two stories in height ; both are <br />
of the Corinthian order, and the coupled columns of the lower story <br />
surmount a pedestal. In the ornaments of the frieze and the upper <br />
compartments of the chimney-piece, invention has produced a variety of <br />
arabesque forms. The whole apartment is panelled with fine oak, in <br />
small panels, with bold and simple mouldings ; on the walls no surbase <br />
is indicated, but the Corinthian pilasters are raised on very high <br />
pedestals, which are enriched on the upper parts by carved ornaments, <br />
taking the form of small arches, their spandrils and centres filled with <br />
arabesques. The pilasters support a highly decorated frieze, or mo- <br />
dillioned cornice, which, as well as the pedestal, is shown at large on <br />
the Plate. Within the apartment, at the lower end, a most beautiful <br />
porch of carved oak is introduced, which was evidently so placed to <br />
break the force of cold air issuing from the door. This highly enriched <br />
portion of the room is surmounted by figures of Diana, Minerva, and <br />
<br />

<br />
Apollo. The ceiling of this apartment is not less ornamental than its <br />
walls ; it is divided into large compartments of a florid pattern, having <br />
small pendants at the intersections ; the interstices of the ribs are filled <br />
with foliage, and with various attributes of rural life, swans and fishes, <br />
the wild boar, hounds, deer, &amp;c. Few examples are now to be found of <br />
more interest to the architect than this splendid room at Stockton, the <br />
decorations of which have never been disturbed by the fickle taste of <br />
intervening proprietors, since its foundation. <br />
<br />
Plate XLI. The centre Compartment of the Arcade at Hatfield <br />
House, Hertfordshire, the Seat of the Marquess of Salisbury. Date <br />
1611. — Hatfield House is situated on an eminence, commanding views <br />
in every direction of an undulated country, equally remarkable for its <br />
natural beauty and excessive fertility ; the park is watered by the river <br />
Lea, and is distant six miles from St. Alban's, and seven from Heitford. <br />
This house is perhaps the very first in the kingdom where a view of <br />
landscape scenery was considered in the design : its situation possesses <br />
great advantages to recommend the choice, the ground rising with a <br />
gentle ascent : the mansion on every side presents itself as a noble and <br />
commanding object. The architects, John Thorp, Bernard Jansen, <br />
Gerard Christmas, Robert and John Smithson, and Nicholas Stone, <br />
were all in high repute at the time Hatfield House was erected ; and it <br />
is rather singular that a building which displays a combination of archi- <br />
tecture on such a magnificent scale, and has attracted much admiration <br />
on account of the grandeur and beauty of its proportions, should have <br />
remained so long without the architect's name being known ; but to <br />
none of the great names of that interesting period, which are extant, <br />
has the merit of this excellent design yet been attributed. There is <br />
certainly enough of the Florentine manner in the beautiful arcade on <br />
the southern front, to induce an opinion that the design was procured <br />
from Italy, but no proof can be obtained that such was really the case. <br />
<br />
The two wings on the principal front of Hatfield House, are con- <br />
nected by a magnificent centre, raised with two orders of architecture ; <br />
and with its entrance porch, which is highly enriched, may be con- <br />
sidered as the most commanding feature of the edifice. The basement <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Story comprises an arcade or corridor, extending the whole length <br />
between the wings, and constructed upon the Italian plan, affording <br />
means of exercise in the air, but sheltered from the sun or rain. The <br />
Doric order adopted in this arcade, agrees with the proportions used <br />
by San Gallo, of Florence, and other Italian masters; the shafts, <br />
resting on pedestals, are partly fluted and partly covered with arabesque <br />
ornament. The tower, Mhich is over the central compartment of the <br />
arcade, rises to the height of seventy feet, and is divided into three <br />
stories, having a bold projection which breaks the uniform line of the <br />
front. The second story of the tower is of the Ionic order, and the <br />
third Corinthian ; in the last are sculptured the full armorial bearings of <br />
the noble founder of the mansion. The parapet is pierced \\dth the date <br />
of the year at the completion of the building, 1611, and above that are <br />
his lordship's armorial crest and coronet. <br />
<br />
Plate XLII. A Compartment in the Upper Storij of the South <br />
Front of Hatfield House. Date 1611.— Hatfield House occupies a <br />
grand parallelogram two hundred and eighty feet in length, and seventy <br />
feet in width. On the southern fi-ont, two wings project at right angles, <br />
each one hundred feet, with a breadth of eighty feet, forming together, <br />
with the centre division, three sides of a court, one hundred and forty feet <br />
in extent, the extreme length of the fi-ont being three hundred feet. <br />
The material of which the mansion is constructed, is principally brick, <br />
but the cases and mullions of the windows, the Ionic pilasters and <br />
architectural enrichments, as well as all the prominent parts most <br />
exposed to injuiy, are of stone. In these the destructive effect of time <br />
is scarcely perceptible, while it has given the whole the mellow pictu- <br />
resque character of age; the weather-stained and mossy bricks har- <br />
monizing admirably with the gray hue of the stone, tad wath the <br />
surrounding landscape. It is also behoved that no house in the king- <br />
dom, erected at so early a date, remains so perfectly entire as this. <br />
The elevation possesses perfect unity of design and execution, in which <br />
the chaste and vigorous feeling, characteristic of the Elizabethan period, <br />
is remarkably prevalent. The windows of the upper story, which give <br />
hght to the long gallery, are square-headed and mullioned, and are <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
44 ELIZABETHAN ARCHITECTURE. <br />
<br />
admirably proportioned to the spaces between the Ionic pilasters, here <br />
introduced to relieve the plainness of the surface. The entablature <br />
charged with arabesque ornament, is surmounted by an elegantly <br />
pierced paraj^et, at the height of fifty feet from the ground. <br />
<br />
Hatfield Plouse forms one of the subjects in Mr. Robinson's Vitruvius <br />
Britannicus, but the details now shown are not given in that valuable <br />
work ; amongst the illustrations, is, however, a most beautiful view of the <br />
gallery to which these windows belong; the length of this gallery <br />
is one hundred and sixty-three feet, but notwithstanding its extreme <br />
length and richness of architectural character, the eng-ravino- is finished <br />
with accuracy, while the general peculiarity of effect is at the same <br />
time admirably preserved. <br />

Plate XLIII. Details of Hatfield House, Hertfordshire. Date <br />
1611. — The subjects of this Plate are : 1. The upper part of one of the <br />
corner turrets of the wings. 2. One of the windows of the upper story <br />
of the wings, the entablature, the lead pipes, and plan of the oriel <br />
window on the front. 3. The pierced parapet on the principal facade. <br />

The large square corner turrets of the wings, are fifty-two feet <br />
six inches in height, to the top of the cornice, and are crowned by <br />
cupola formed roofs, covered with lead, rising thirteen feet to the top of <br />
the ball on the pinnacles ; these are terminated by gilded vanes, orna- 												<!-- google_ad_section_start(weight=ignore) -->

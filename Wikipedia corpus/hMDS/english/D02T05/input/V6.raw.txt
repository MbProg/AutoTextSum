Douglas AD/A-1 "Skyraider" | AD-6 (A-1H) | BuNo.135284 | M
at the beginning 1960 decade — 27-02-1962
On the early morning of February 27, 1962, this Skyraider piloted by 1st Lt. Pham Phu Quoc and another (BuNo.135284) piloted by 2nd Lt. Nguyen Van Cu took off from Bien Hoa Air Base for a close air support mission in the 4th Tactical Corps, but instead of flying straight to the target area, they attacked South Vietnamese Independence Palace at Saigon and tried to kill President Diem during coup-attempt. This A-1H was shot down by Viet Nam naval anti-aircraft fire and fell down to Saigon river. Pilot Pham Phu Quoc survived, but imprisoned until 1963. The aircraft was soon recovered from Saigon river.

  <b><p>The story of psychological operations (PSYOP) in Vietnam is difficult to relate.
  There were a host of originators of propaganda and the lines of authority and control are
  difficult to unravel and chart. I have made an attempt in this article to outline the
  order of battle (OB) as it has been published in official and other documents. This is an
  ongoing project and one that I hope the readers will help me to finish. It is a labor of
  love. The data is from official records, published books, magazines, field manuals,
  interviews, and anecdotes. I believe it is fairly accurate, but I am sure that there are
  many omissions. I ask any reader who can add to this story to write to me at the address
  below. I will be happy to add any data that will make this story more complete.</p>

    qualities: he was a certified anti-Communist nationalist, he was a Roman Catholic, and he
    understood English.</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>After the partition of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region> with the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Geneva</st1:place></st1:City> Agreements of 1954, the Eisenhower
    administration began to directly support the government in the South headed by Ngo Dinh
    Diem. President Eisenhower, in a letter to Diem, promised to help Diem maintain a
    &quot;strong, viable state capable of resisting outside aggression.&quot; Armed with this
    support, in July 1954, Diem rejected the reunification elections provided for in the <st1:City w:st="on">Geneva</st1:City>
    Agreements and declared <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> a republic with himself as president. The CIA,
    although pessimistic about establishing a stable, civilian regime in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
    nevertheless set about assisting Diem in creating a new state. </i></b></p>

  <p>In 1956 the Viet Cong, aided by North Vietnam, pressed war in the south, and South
  Vietnam began receiving U.S. aid. Large-scale North Vietnamese troop infiltrations of the
  south began in 1964, with the support of China and the Soviet Union. Masses of troops were
  stationed in border areas of Laos and Cambodia.</p>

    greetings to the kith-and-kin compatriots of the North and their sincere wishes for an
    early return to peace in our beloved country.</i></b></p>

    despite savage sabotage by the Communists, to build a democratic society in the South in
    which the citizens are free to make a living and to speak about their righteous
    aspirations.</i></b></p>

  <p><b>Nguyen Cao Ky was a dashing pilot who liked to walk around wearing his flight suit.
  He was quite the charmer and a close friend of mine who flew with him told me that he
  presented all the pilots with chrome-plated .357 pistols. The CIA did not think highly of
  Ky according to Thomas Ahern&#146;s declassified secret publication entitled. <i

  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>As of June 1965, Station contacts depicted a first-class pilot and a poor
    administrator whose genuine charisma had given Air Force morale a dramatic boost when he
    became its commander in late 1963. He was also a thrill seeker and risk taker, according
    to intimates, renowned for his drinking, gambling, and an endless' succession of
    girlfriends; he also indulged a penchant for insubordination. </i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>In return, Ky did not think very kindly of his American allies. He said at various
  times:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>I am not bitter about America's involvement here, but I am bitter about the fact
    that her policy makers never listened to my advice. That is a glaring weakness with
    American foreign policy. Washington politicians and bureaucrats think they know more than
    the natives of a country like Vietnam. That is the arrogance of Washington and in my
    opinion it is an attitude that will always get America into trouble in countries they know
    very little about&#133;</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>I have consistently told Washington you cannot win a defensive war in Vietnam
    when the other side is engaged in an offensive war. By fighting a limited, defensive war,
    the U.S. allowed the North Vietnamese to continuously re-supply their units in the field. <o:p></o:p></i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>The worst thing that happened to South Vietnam was when we allowed the United
    States to take control of our war with the North. Long before America decided to quit the
    war, I realized that this would be the inevitable result of America&#146;s lack of
    commitment to victory. I offered to lead a South Vietnamese attack on North Vietnam, which
    was defended by a single division of regular troops. All I required from the US was air
    support.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>

  monarchy. The nation consisted of political ideologies from communist to conservative to
  neutralist. The Communist forces were made up of Prince Chao Souphanouvong (The Red
  Prince), Kaysone Phomvihane, the Pathet Lao and their North Vietnamese allies (supported
  by Red China and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">USSR</st1:place></st1:country-region>). The pro-Western forces included King Savang Vatthana, Prince
  Boun Oum, General Phoumi Nosavan and the Hmong guerrillas and militia led by General Vang
  Pao (backed secretly by the U.S. Government and the Central Intelligence Agency). The
  neutralists consisted of Prince Souvanna Phouma, General Kong Le, and the Royal Lao
  Government. Conflicts among neutralist, communist, and conservative factions led to
  increasingly chaotic and violent conflicts, particularly after 1960. The formal
  Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos, signed on 23 July 1962, provided for a coalition
  government and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country by 7 October. The
  three factions then formed a coalition government with Prince Souvanna Phouma as premier.

  <p><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Laos</st1:place></st1:country-region> was divided into five Military Regions (MR). MR I was in the northwest, including

  Long Tieng, Sam Neua and Sam Thong; MR III consisted of the central panhandle region,
  including Savannakhet and much of the Ho Chi Minh trail. MR IV was in the south, including
  Pakse and the Bolovens Plateau; finally MR V consisted of the neutral zone around <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vientiane</st1:place></st1:City>.<o:p><o:p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Early in the war there were plans to use local Lao tribes as part of an American-led
  resistance movement. This plan was forwarded to American Ambassador Sullivan who was
  concerned that it might be impossible to limit and control such an operation. Furthermore,
  if the resistance got into trouble there would be no way to militarily support them, which
  might result in their very embarrassing slaughter.</p>
  <p>Amidst the Vietnam War in 1970, the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> increased its military activities, but after

  Pathet Lao took control. A Lao People's Democratic Republic, strongly influenced by <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
  was proclaimed 3 December 1975. The <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Republic</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:PlaceName> and the United States Government

  against the Viet Cong moving southward on the Ho Chi Minh Trail:</p>
  <blockquote>

    were dropped informing the enemy that he has been bombed by B-52s and showed him a picture
    of the bomber which flew so high that he would otherwise never see it. It reminded him
    that the bombers would come again and urged the Viet Cong to use the printed safe conduct
    pass on the leaflet. Another operation, the &#147;Trail Campaign&#148; was directed
    against military and civilian personnel who used and maintained the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
    Most of the Trail leaflets bore a numerical code from 1-125 and the letter &#147;T.&#148;</i></p>

  <p align="center"><i>You will never see one of these</i></p>

    <p><i>You probably won't hear it. It flies too high. It is a B-52 bomber, used by the

    places. One B-52 carries 29,700 kilos of bombs and can drop them with pin-point accuracy,
    dealing certain death to everyone within the target area. The B-52 can strike you at any

  <p>We should mention the fear factor produced by the B-52 bomber. Truong Nhu Tang talks
  about the bombers in <i>Viet Cong Memoir. </i>He called the strikes&nbsp;&#147;undiluted
  psychological terror.&#148; Despite having been hunted by South Vietnamese and American
  ground forces and having endured all of the privations and hardships associated with the

  <p align="left"><u>Cambodia: </u>During late 1966 and 1967, the U.S. Military Assistance
  Command Vietnam (MACV) conducted an intensive PSYWAR campaign against North Vietnamese
  army troops located along the Cambodian border with South Vietnam. In an effort to
  minimize violation of Cambodian air space, MACV used the wind drift method of leaflet
  dissemination, whereby aircraft flew along the border and used favorable wind currents to
  carry leaflets into Cambodia. U.S. leaflet drops from Cambodian air space were never
  officially acknowledged. However, information from a recently declassified top secret
  report <i>US PSYOP structure in Vietnam</i> published in the <i>MACVSOG Command History,

    Washington) in answering any press queries on a background basis: &quot;We have for

  <h2 align="center"><align="center"><u>US PSYOP Structure in Vietnam</u></h2>
  <p>Propaganda and safe-conduct passes and leaflets were produced under the jurisdiction of
  the Joint U. S. Public Affairs Office (JUSPAO). JUSPAO was formed in July 1965, following
  11 years of increasingly uncoordinated and inefficient psychological operations that began
  in summer of 1954 during Vietnam's transition from French rule. JUSPAO was given authority
  for all propaganda activities in an effort to end disputes and lack of coordination
  between Americans and Vietnamese and between American military and civilian agencies.</p>
  <p><b>Major Marcus S. Welch says in <i>Irregular Pen and Limited Sword: Psywar, Psyop, and
  Miso in Counterinsurgency</i>, Pennyhill Press:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>JUSPAO was a complex organization, consisting of five major departments: Office
    of the Director, Information, Cultural Affairs, North Vietnamese Affairs, Technical
    Services, and Field Development. JUSPAO was sizable; at its peak it possessed a staff of
    over six hundred American and Vietnamese employees, rivaling its military counterparts.
    Apart from JUSPAO&#146;s executive responsibilities, the organization conducted PSYOP in
    direct and advisory roles, primarily using mass media outlets such as the Republic of
    Vietnam&#146;s Voice of Freedom and the overt US Voice of America radio stations. JUSPAO
    delved into television, supporting Truyen Hinh Viet Nam, a Government of Vietnam
    television station, in 1965. Similarly, JUSPAO created a number of printed products such
    as the Ngon Song newspaper, and the Huong Que, Gioi Tu-Do, Long Ne, and Van Tac Vu
    magazines. Synchronization and coordination were also the responsibilities of JUSPAO.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>With a civilian director (initially, Barry Zorthian) reporting to the U.S. Information
  Agency (USIA), JUSPAO integrated the psychological operations of the U.S. Information
  Service (USIS, USIA's overseas arm), The State Department's U.S. Agency for International
  Development (USAID), the Joint Chief's Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV), and the
  U .S. Embassy. At its apex it employed 695 people, 245 Americans and 116 from the military
  and had an annual budget of 10 million dollars. Zorthian seemed a good choice for the
  position of director since he had been a combat Marine and a reporter for <i>Time</i>
  Magazine before working for the United States Information Agency. An understanding was
  reached in 1966 that whereas JUSPAO would retain responsibility for overall PSYOP policy
  and would conduct strategic operations such as the Chieu Hoi surrender program, MACV would
  be responsible for PSYOP tactical field operations. </p>
  <p><b>Don North wrote about Barry Zorthian in January 2011 upon his death at age 90. He
  said in part:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>At Yale, Zorthian practiced journalism&#133;He was editor of The Yale Daily News
    and became a member of the secret campus society, Skull and Bones, a controversial
    fraternity whose members included both Presidents Bush and other American powerbrokers.</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>Upon graduation in 1941, Zorthian served in a U.S. Marine artillery unit in the
    South Pacific and came out a captain. After the war ended, he took a job at CBS radio in
    New York. He received a law degree from New York University but instead of practicing law
    preferred journalism and spent 13 years with the Voice of America as a reporter, editor
    and program manager.</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>In 1961, Zorthian joined the State Department and became a deputy public affairs
    officer in the U.S. Embassy, New Delhi, India. Three years later, in February 1964, U.S.
    Information Agency Director Edward R. Murrow appointed him as head of the Joint U.S.
    Public Affairs Office in Vietnam.</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>Although untrained in the art of psychological operations, Zorthian was
    responsible for coordinating these tactics designed to erode the morale of the enemy and
    win the allegiance of the Vietnamese people through &#147;hearts and minds&#148; programs.
    </i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>Zorthian invested in excess of $10 million a year in dropping tons of leaflets;

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The commander and staff of MACV placed great emphasis on PSYOP from the planning
    stages of the troop buildup in 1965. One reason for this, in addition to the perceived
    failure of PSYOP advisory efforts, was the agreed division of responsibilities between
    MACV and JUSPAO. This agreement specified that MACV would execute </i></p>
    <p><i>PSYOP in the field and provide print capability to JUSPAO, so MACV planners
    requested the addition of units with these capabilities to the troop buildup.</i></p>
    <p><i>Because General Westmoreland and his staff appreciated and encouraged the use of <st1:City w:st="on">PSYOP</st1:City>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">    U.S.</st1:country-region> Army PSYOP units would deploy and operate in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> in unprecedented numbers
    compared to previous conflicts. One instrument used to communicate and encourage this
    &#147;marked interest&#148; in PSYOP was USMACV Directive 525-3, dated 7 September 1965,
    &#147;which emphasized discrimination in the application of firepower and the use of all
    available PSYOP resources&#148; in combat operations</i></p>

  <p><b>The newspaper Mien Nam Tu-Do was written by the Field Development Division, then
  printed in the United States Information Agency plant in Manila, with the cost paid for by
  the U.S. Army (7th PSYOP Group). Each issue was given a regular JUSPAO code number. For
  instance, mini-newspaper issue 49 of November, 1968 was coded 2984. The newspaper targeted
  rural areas of Vietnam that were not served by the civilian press. Its purpose was to keep
  those rural areas informed of national programs in their behalf; publicize Government
  victories and Communist defeats; developments in the Chieu Hoi program; Free World
  assistance to the Government of Vietnam; and the anti-Government actions by Hanoi, the NLF
  and the Viet Cong. The newspaper came in both a regular and a mini-size issue. In 1968,
  520,000 copies of the mini-issue were distributed to the 44 provinces mostly by hand
  instead of air drop. The size of the mini-edition is 9.5-inches by 10.5-inches.</b></p>
  <p><b>The full-size newspaper was 10.5-inches by 16-inches. Full-sized number 10 was dated
  November, 1968 and coded 2987. In 1968, 2,000,000 copies were printed every other week.
  Occasionally, special issues were produced. The newspaper was printed in Manila and flown
  to Vietnam for distribution by the four PSYOP Battalions. 1,300,000 copies were issued to
  the battalion to be airdropped over Viet Cong areas. The other 700,000 issues were shipped
  to the 44 provinces. Full-sized issue 10 depicted a photograph of President Nixon and news
  of his election as President of the United States.</b></p>
  <p><b>We should mention that the U.S. also printed newspapers for the Vietnamese. JUSPAO
  2955, printed in November, 1968, was entitled <i>Ngon Song</i>. 30,000 copies of this
  newspaper were prepared and handed out by the Vietnamese Information Service (VIS) Cadre
  to urban citizens that lived around the capitol of Saigon. The general theme of the
  newspaper was &#147;The Government of Vietnam&#146;s image.&#148;</b></p>

  <blockquote>

    and then realized that it was the name of a province in which Nha Trang City is located.

  full-sized JUSPAO poster. This one measures 30 inches in height by 11 inches in width. It
  would normally be tacked to a large board where Vietnamese civilians congregate. There are
  two images of Vietnamese self-defense forces on parade. The text is:</p>

  <p>Many of the posters prepared by JUSPAO for the South Vietnamese people encouraged

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>We list 438 posters produced by the Joint U.S. Public Affairs Office (JUSPAO) for
    use in psychological warfare activities supporting the Government of South Vietnam (GVN)
    during the Vietnam War. The poster themes and designs reflect the fierce competition
    between the two Vietnams, North and South, to &#147;win the hearts and minds&#148; of the
    South Vietnamese public. Posters are grouped under ten main themes reflecting JUSPAO
    propaganda priorities. </i></p>
    <p><i>The theme with the largest poster concentration is &quot;Support Social and Economic
    Accomplishments,&quot; comprising one third of the total item count. This category
    highlights the activities of the government's Revolutionary Development program to work
    alongside rural Vietnamese in building houses, medical centers, roads, wells, bridges,
    schools, markets, and in making other infrastructure improvements. Many of the rural
    communities featured were the New Life Hamlets.</i></p>
    <p><i>Another well-represented theme is &#147;Encourage the Goals of the Chieu Hoi
    Program,&#148; referring to the South Vietnamese government program designed to encourage
    and facilitate the defection of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers back to the
    Southern cause. </i></p>
    <p><i>The &#147;Explain American Presence in Vietnam&#148; grouping illustrates the
    activities of U.S. military personnel in Vietnam, with the purpose of assuring the rural
    people of the South of the friendly intentions of the United States. Several posters in
    this category feature South Korean forces engaged in similar activities. A small number
    also feature the activities in Vietnam of other allied forces from Thailand, New Zealand,
    the Philippines and Australia. </i></p>
    <p><i>Another large category, &#147;Exploit All Military Victories,&#148; publicizes
    military victories won by Popular Forces, Regional Forces and Army of the Republic of
    Vietnam (ARVN) forces against the Viet Cong. </i></p>
    <p><i>The &#147;Exploit Viet Cong Vulnerabilities&#148; highlights the depredations and
    atrocities committed by the Viet Cong in the South. Pictures show dead and wounded
    atrocity victims, funerals of victims, captured Viet Cong perpetrators, buildings damaged
    and destroyed in Viet Cong attacks, the hardships imposed on the people by Viet Cong
    actions, and anti-Viet Cong protest rallies. A few posters also relate the story of the
    Viet Cong defector, Nguyen Van Be, shown holding North Vietnamese newspapers that
    erroneously announce his sacrifice of his life for the sake of the Northern cause.</i></p>
    <p><i>The smaller-volume categories feature messages on public health issues, Vietnamese
    armed forces recruitment, and a broad miscellany of subjects that include the U.S. Apollo
    11 lunar mission, Vietnamese public security, and the inauguration ceremony for South
    Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu. </i></p>

  <p align="center">Chieu Hoi Propaganda Team Member</p>
  <p align="left">JUSPAO carried out extensive campaigns to induce North Vietnamese troops
  to surrender. The bulk of money and attention was focused on the <a
  href="ChieuHoiProgram.html">Chieu Hoi</a> (Open Arms) program to encourage Viet Cong to
  &quot;rally&quot; to the cause of the Republic of Vietnam. Begun in 1963 and administered
  by JUSPAO after its formation in 1965, the Chieu Hoi campaign resulted in billions of
  leaflets, millions of posters, magazines, and leaflets, and thousands of hours of
  loudspeaker exhortations encouraging Viet Cong defection; this is said to have been the
  largest propaganda campaign in history, with over 10 billion leaflets dropped in 1969
  alone. In addition to offering amnesty and good treatment, monetary rewards were offered
  and paid to defectors who turned in weapons. Rewards were offered to third parties who
  induced Viet Cong to defect, with special bonuses for mass defections. These schemes were
  highly successful and were extended through 1969, but were terminated on 31 December 1969,
  probably because of abuses in awarding the money. We should also mention the <i>Dai Doan
  Ket</i> Program. This was a Chieu Hoi program aimed at middle and higher cadre in the Viet
  Cong. Most officers had come from the peasantry and it was believed that they would not
  rally to the Government just to be returned to the peasant class. This program promised to
  accept high-ranking returnees and place them in responsible positions.</p>
  <p>The 6 August 1967 <i>PSYOP Guide</i> prepared by the Office of the Psychological
  Operations Directorate of the United States Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, mentions
  the Dai Doan Ket Program:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Potential defectors need to be reassured concerning the treatment they will receive
    after rallying and the opportunities offered them for reintegration into society. Former
    middle-level and higher cadre have stated their desire to prove themselves by working for
    the Government of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"> Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> in jobs that make use of their qualifications. Leaflets making
    specific reference to the &#147;Dai Doan Ket&#148; (National Reconciliation Program) which
    is aimed at helping qualified returnees find employment commensurate with their previous
    training and experience should be particularly useful in appealing to this group.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There were numerous command and control problems at JUSPAO just as there were in the
  field PSYOP groups and battalions. Colonel William E. Linn was the Chief of Policy, Plans
  and Research and later the Assistant Director for Field Operations from March 1968 to
  April 1969. He wrote a <i>PSYOP After-Action Report</i> on 6 June 1969 that details the
  problems and recommendations for solving them. I will just mention a few of the more
  important ones. COL Linn is particularly disturbed that JUSPAO was never warned in advance
  about major policy shifts, and if given advance notice, was not allowed to utilize the
  information for PSYOP. He gives as example the bombing halts of March 1968 and October
  1968. On both occasions JUSPAO was ready to tell the Vietnamese people why the bombing was
  halted. Because they had no guidance or permission they were unable to do so. As a result:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Hanoi propagandists had a field day pounding all Vietnamese target audiences that
    they had won a total victory; to fight on until the U.S. aggressors are forced out of
    Vietnam; that the North Vietnamese regime had not conceded anything to the United States
    at Paris; and that the United States was required to admit defeat due to U.S. and world
    public opinion; and that the bombing halt was proof that the communists&#146; fight in the
    Republic of Vietnam was just and right.</i> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Linn complains about the lack of a single person in charge of all PSYOP in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
  This complaint is seen again and again in after-actions. There was far too much division
  of authority.</p>
  <p>An interesting complaint is that although JUSPAO in theory is in general charge of
  PSYOP, they are not cleared to know what black operations are being performed by MACV-SOG.
  He worries that the two agencies might be sending different messages to the enemy:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>It is recognized that this is a sensitive area, but we must also recognize that the
    effectiveness of PSYOP is predicated, to a large degree, on a coordinated effort.&nbsp; In
    the case of these two activities, the product they are attempting to sell should
    complement one another; thereby adding to the credibility of each other&#146;s product.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Finally, a complaint that I have seen in almost every PSYOP after-action since the
  Korean War is the training of personnel. Linn says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>As an example, in the Army the bulk of resources for PSYOP come from the Armor and
    Artillery branches, while in the Air Force the majority are ex-bombardiers of other SAC
    personnel. A further deficiency in the selection criteria is that officers selected for
    the JUSPAO staff seldom if ever are &#147;old hands&#148; with background and experience.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Curiously. Linn supports his own argument. His signature block shows that he was a
  &#147;Colonel, Field Artillery.&#148;</p>

  by William Lloyd Stearman who headed the North Vietnamese Affairs Division of the Joint
  U.S. Public Affairs Office from December 1965 to September 1967. He states that when he
  arrived he was the only officer in the Saigon mission that had actual experience with
  Communist affairs. Stearman says that the early leafleting campaign was not as effective
  as it could have been in his book: <i>An American Adventure</i>, Naval Institute Press,
  Annapolis, MD, 2012. He says that in 1965:<O:P></span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>I scurried around the State Department in search of expertise on North Vietnam. To
    my astonishment, we had no one working fulltime on a country with which we had been de
    facto at war for nearly a year&#133;</i></p>
    <p><i>JUSPAO was largely staffed by officers the United States Information Service and
    Army and Air Force officers. The result was an organization that was predictably weak in
    substance and long on techniques. I rarely heard any discussion on why we were doing
    anything. It was almost always about how we were doing it&#133;</i></p>
    <p>[JUSPAO] <i>got most of its information about the North from Vietnamese who came South
    in 1954 to escape Communist rule in the North. More than ten years had elapsed since they
    left and much had changed in the interim. In other words, their knowledge about the North
    was hopelessly outdated. I went through all the leaflets in our inventory and had a number
    of questions about them. I decided to show them to captured North Vietnamese Army soldiers
    to see their reaction. I was not surprised to see that they didn&#146;t seem to understand
    the messages. For one thing, there was a constant harping on the Chinese menace. Chinese
    forces, especially artillery, were in a large measure responsible for the decisive
    Communist defeat of French forces at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. China provided considerable
    military assistance to the North&#133;In other words; I believed the people in the North
    had begun to look on the Chinese more as friends than as foes&#133;.</i></p>

  <p>Thomas C. Sorensen tells us more about special JUSPAO teams in <em>The Word War</em>,
  Harper &amp; Row, N.Y., 1968: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>JUSPAO helped train six-man Van Tac Vu (Cultural Drama Service) troupes and
    assisted in the production of their material. The entertainers - among them, attractive
    actresses unaccustomed to hardship - traveled in black pajamas commonly worn by peasants,
    and lived with the villagers as they moved around the countryside, performing twenty or
    more shows a month. The troupes sang patriotic songs (&quot;Vietnam, Vietnam&quot; and
    &quot;Our House&quot;), amused and indoctrinated the peasantry with primitive dramas about
    villainous Viet Cong and heroic South Vietnamese soldiers and officials, and off stage
    distributed medicines, seed, food, and pamphlets, and helped at chores ranging from
    repairing damaged buildings to bathing infants.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The <i>PSYOP Guide </i>also mentions Culture Drama teams:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>This group, made up of all types of entertainers, provides culture drama shows for
    Vietnamese military primarily in the Capital Military District. Organic to each POLWAR
    Battalion in the four Corps is a culture Platoon which provides entertainment throughout
    the Corps area in the form of songs, dramas, dances and similar activities. In the remote
    areas, these platoons may provide the only source of entertainment for the people.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Under the heading &#147;Current Activities&#148; the <i>PSYOP Guide</i> mentions other
  programs of interest: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><u>Armed Propaganda Teams</u> are made up of ralliers under the Chieu Hoi Program.
    The teams provide their own protection and have proven most effective in obtaining
    ralliers, quite frequently by interacting with the families of known Viet Cong.</i></p>
    <p><i><u>Mobile Training Teams</u> provide on-site indoctrination training for the Popular
    Forces in each of the four Corps. The purpose of the teams is to promote solidarity and
    morale of the Popular Forces.</i></p>
    <p><i><u>Medical Civic Action Program</u> (MEDCAP). The basic intent of MEDCAP is to
    establish and maintain a continuing spirit of mutual respect and cooperation between the
    Vietnamese and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> military medical personal and the civilian population by providing
    basic medical care to the people living in rural and often Viet Cong infested villages and
    hamlets.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Under &#147;PSYOP Programs&#148; the 1968 Guide says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><u>The Chieu Hoi Program</u> consists of all activities designed to cause members of
    the Viet Cong and their supporters to return to the rightful and legitimate government of
    the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Republic</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
    <p><i><u>The Dai Doan Ket Program</u> extends the Chieu Hoi program to middle and high
    level Viet Cong cadre.</i></p>
    <p><i><u>The B-52 Follow-up Program</u>. Within four hours of a B-52 strike leaflets are
    dropped informing the enemy that he has been bombed by B-52s and showing him a picture of
    the bomber which flies so high that he would otherwise never see it. It reminds him that
    the bombers will come again and urges the Viet Cong to use the safe conduct pass.</i></p>
    <p><i><u>The North Vietnamese personnel in South Vietnam Program</u> is designed to create
    doubts and fears in the minds of enemy troops about their chance of survival; the dangers
    of injury and disease; burial in unmarked graves; the hopelessness of their situation; the
    fate of their friends and relatives in the north, and the competence of their commanders.</i></p>
    <p><i><u>The Weapons Reward Program</u> offers money and gifts for retrieval of weapons
    and ordnance.</i></p>
    <p><i><u>The Defoliation Program</u> provides security for lines of communication by
    removing dense vegetation that could be used to conceal ambush sites, remove jungle cover
    from enemy base areas and infiltration routes, and provide increased visibility around
    friendly installations. PSYOP programs can minimize any adverse psychological impact of
    defoliation and reduce the effect of enemy propaganda by providing the population with
    timely information.</i> <i><u>The defoliant used in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place> is particularly effective
    against broadleaf vegetation and is harmless to men and animals.</u></i></p>
    <p><i><u>The Frantic Goat Campaign</u> formally known as &#147;Fact Sheet &#148;
    disseminates news and related facts to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. </i></p>
    <p><i><u>The Trail Campaign</u> is directed against military and civilian personnel who
    use and maintain the Ho Chi Minh Trail.</i></p>
    <p><i><u>The Tallyho Campaign</u> is conducted in the panhandle area of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>
    against the civilians who maintain the lines of communications and warns them that the
    lines will continue to be interdicted and bombed. </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The later December 1973 <i>Survey of Psychological Operations in Vietnam </i>adds more
  data about operations at the end of the war:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>After the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City> Agreements were signed earlier this year, most leaflet operations
    were halted. Operation Trail, a leaflet program against North Vietnamese troops on the Ho
    Chi Minh Trail; the Royal Lao air Force Operation Fountain Pen, directed against North
    Vietnamese troops in Laos, and Operation Rice River, directed against North Vietnamese
    troops in Cambodia, continued for a period.</i></p>
    <p><i>There is one Khmer language leaflet campaign. Operation Big Show, a gray leaflet
    (without attribution) by the Khmer government&#133;Operation Freedom Care, a white leaflet
    (U.S. attribution) to Vietnamese communists in the Khmer Republic&#133; the Khmer Republic
    has a small leaflet program. The government of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> leaflet program is sharply limited
    and rated ineffective&#133;</i></p>
    <p><i>Most of the leaflet printing capability is in the hands of the Americans&#133;Giant
    presses are operated by the Seventh PSYOP Group in Okinawa and at the United States
    Information Agency&#146;s Regional Service Center in Manila. </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Bob Fulton was the Executive Officer for Regional Service Center (RSC) in Manila, (part
  of the United States Information Agency (USIA). He told me about the printing plant:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>In mid-1967 JUSPAO and MACV outsourced to our organization a significant portion of
    the design, procurement, production and logistics of printed PSYOP products, especially
    those that required four-colors. This was a Department of Defense-State Department level
    joint decision based in part on capacity and capability, strategic location, and a few
    convoluted international and domestic political considerations. Until I left in the second
    half of 1970, almost the entire high-altitude leaflet drops were printed on our presses,
    packed in our plant in triple-wall cardboard air-drop containers together with release
    shrouds, and either shipped to Clark AFB or by U.S. ship to a Republic of Vietnam or
    Thailand port for subsequent transport to one of five bases. If memory serves me
    correctly, October or November 1968 was the high mark for leaflet drops, almost 1 billion,
    and we produced 75% to 80% of that total.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">There was no U.S. Army PSYOP commander, although JUSPAO was represented at
  command level through a coordinating committee.</p>
  <p>The President of the United States directed in 1970 that an Ad Hoc PSYOP Committee on
  Vietnam be formed to provide direction for and coordination of psychological warfare
  against the Vietnamese Communists. The Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group proposed the following
  objectives for more effective coordination of psychological operations against the
  Vietnamese Communists.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Develop a National Psychological Warfare strategy directed against the Vietnamese
    Communists, including psychological objectives to be accomplished.</p>
    <p>2. Coordinate the overall psychological warfare effort against the Vietnamese
    Communists.</p>
    <p>3. Provide thematic guidance.</p>
    <p>4. Prepare periodic reports to the Assistant to the President for National Security
    Affairs on our psychological warfare operations against the Vietnamese Communists.</p>
    <p>5. Assess the anticipated psychological impact of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place> related policy options as
    appropriate.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Other decisions relating to a psychological warfare strategy, as well as other
  decisions covering major issues in the conduct of our psychological warfare against the
  Vietnamese Communists, were to be referred to the President for approval. Additional
  recommendations were to persuade the Communist Party leadership to change its policies;
  increase internal tensions, doubts, and policies; and motivate the Vietnamese people to
  question the wisdom of the North Vietnamese Government. The proposed targets were the top
  Party leadership, the Party apparatus, the North Vietnamese people, and Communist forces
  in the north and south. The themes developed for each target were designed to convince
  them that the war could not be won and policies must be changed, to increase war weariness
  and discouragement among troops and the population, and to cause resentment and tension
  between northerners and southerners. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><u>The United States Prepares to pull out of Vietnam</u></h2>
  <p>Under President Nixon&#146;s plan of Vietnamization; giving the war to the South
  Vietnamese, PSYOP units began to disband. The 4th PSYOP Group disbanded in 12 October
  1971.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, in an attempt to get the North Vietnamese to the peace table the United
  States began the bombing of the North. This campaign was called Operation FIELD GOAL, a
  psychological operation against North Vietnam from July 1972 to the cease-fire in January
  1973. The original plan for directing PSYOP against NVN existed in 1965 under the code
  name FACT SHEET. Originally conceived by JUSPAO as a threat campaign, its main message
  threatened increased bombing if the North Vietnamese continued to support their
  government's policies. Later, the program was renamed FRANTIC GOAT and was redirected to
  inform the people of North Vietnam of the actual progress of the war and of the intentions
  of the government of the Republic of Vietnam and its Allies. The total number of leaflets
  dropped by all aircraft types during FIELD GOAL operations from 1 July 1972 to 28 January
  1973 was 660,649,000. This was an average of slightly over 94 million per month compared
  to the desired 240 million.</p>
  <p>On <u>1 July 1972</u>, the management and control of PSYOP in Southeast Asia (SEA)
  shifted from the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), to Commander-in-Chief,
  Pacific (CINCPAC). The general concept developed for post-Vietnamization PSYOP aerial
  activity continued to be the high-altitude, wind-drift delivery of leaflets to targeted
  areas.</p>
  <p>The 5th, 7th, and 13th Air Forces, provided delivery and logistics support. The
  Strategic Air Command (SAC) was tasked to provide B-52s or drone aircraft when authorized
  by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). The Army's 7th Psychological Operations Group in
  Okinawa, provided the packaged leaflets, handling and loading, and information on tile
  wind-borne characteristics of the leaflets.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><u>PSYOP CHRONOLOGY</u></h2>
  <p>U. S. Army Major Michael G. Barger wrote a thesis entitled &#147;Psychological
  Operations Supporting Counterinsurgency: 4th PSYOP Group in Vietnam.&#148; In it, he gave
  a chronology of PSYOP in Vietnam. We mention some of the more important dates here:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>27 APR 1960 - CINCPAC directs deployment of PSYWAR personnel to Vietnam. </p>
    <p>FEB 1962 - First PSYWAR Mobile Training Team (MTT) arrives in Vietnam </p>
    <p>14 MAY 1965 - Formation of the Joint U.S. Public Affairs Office (JUSPAO). </p>
    <p>22 JUL 1965 - 1st Provisional PSYOP Detachment ordered to Vietnam by U.S. Army
    Broadcasting and Visual Activity Pacific (USABVAPAC) </p>
    <p>02 SEP 1965 - 24th PSYOP Detachment arrives in Qui Nhon. </p>
    <p>07 FEB 1966 - 6th PSYOP Battalion activated at Tan Son Nhut. </p>
    <p>10 FEB 1966 - 244th, 245th, and 246th Tactical Propaganda Companies activated at Nha
    Trang, Pleiku, and Bien Hoa. </p>
    <p>19 NOV 1966 - 19th PSYOP Company (Advice and Support) activated at Can Tho. </p>
    <p>01 DEC 1967 - 6th PSYOP Battalion redesignated 4th PSYOP Group; 244th PSYOP Company
    redesignated 7th PSYOP Battalion; 246th PSYOP Company redesignated 8th PSYOP Battalion;
    19th PSYOP Company redesignated 10th PSYOP Battalion. </p>
    <p>05 DEC 1967 - 245th PSYOP Company redesignated 6th PSYOP Battalion. </p>
    <p>16 APR 1971 - 10th PSYOP Battalion inactivated. </p>
    <p>26 JUN 1971 - 8th PSYOP Battalion inactivated. </p>
    <p>30 JUN 1971 - 6th PSYOP Battalion inactivated. </p>
    <p>02 OCT 1971 - 4th PSYOP Group inactivated. </p>
    <p>21 DEC 1971 - 7th PSYOP Battalion inactivated.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2 align="center"><u>Leaflet Codes</u></h2>
  <p>The vast majority of Vietnam leaflets bore codes. For the most part they are simple to
  read. In general, the originating unit placed its number first, then the number of the
  leaflet (for that year), and finally the year itself. So, we would expect to find leaflets
  starting with 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 244, 245, 246, etc. A leaflet will generally have a code
  like 6-250-68 which indicates that it was the 250th leaflet produced (or distributed) in
  1968 by the 6th PSYOP Battalion. </p>
  <p>Early JUSPAO leaflets had the code &quot;SP&quot; (Special Project) before the leaflet
  number. For example, SP-2250. JUSPAO removed the &quot;SP&quot; when it became clear that
  it identified the leaflet as American in origin. The later leaflets would have only a
  numerical code like &quot;4450.&quot; This was explained in an issue of the 4th PSYOP
  Group monthly magazine <em>Credibilis </em>of 10 January 1968 which explained the change
  thusly:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Letters of the alphabet will no longer be used in 4th PSYOP Group leaflet
    designations to eliminate any markings which would tend to identify the leaflet as being
    of American Origin.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The earliest numbered leaflets (before they were marked with a unit number) simply
  showed a numerical and a year. For instance, leaflets in the <i>I Corps Tactical Zone
  Leaflet Catalog &#150; Joint Psywar Civil Affairs Center,</i> have codes like
  &#147;79-66&#148; or &#147;183-66.&#148; The catalog calls them &#147;the 66 series&#148;
  so it might apply to the year 1966 or it might be something completely different. Later
  on, unit designations were added. Number coded leaflets starting with &quot;4-&quot; are
  Fourth PSYOP Group. Number coded leaflets starting with &quot;6-&quot; are Sixth PSYOP
  Battalion, &quot;7-&quot; are Seventh PSYOP Battalion, &quot;8-&quot; are Eighth PSYOP
  Battalion, and &quot;10-&quot; are Tenth PSYOP Battalion. Higher numbered leaflets are
  usually the earlier PSYOP Companies; &quot;19-&quot; are the 19th PSYOP Company,
  &#147;244-&#148; are the 244th PSYOP Company, &quot;245-&quot; are the 245th PSYOP Company
  and &quot;246-&quot; represents the 246th PSYOP Company. I have not seen leaflets starting
  &quot;24-&quot;, but there may be some printed by the 24th PSYOP Company.</p>
  <p>In addition, there were a number of special codes. Leaflets dropped along the Ho Chi
  Minh Trail as part of the &quot;Trail Campaign&quot; had the letter &quot;T.&quot; An
  example is T80 or 95T. Leaflets dropped on North Vietnam during the Operation Fact Sheet
  or Operation Frantic Goat of 1965-68 have very low numbers, from 1-151. There are Vietnam
  leaflets that had a very low code number preceded by a period. Examples are .214, .219,
  and .228. There are other codes such as &quot;A&quot; (the basic form of a leaflet when
  there is more than one variation); &quot;H&quot; (handbill), &quot;P&quot; (poster) and
  &quot;R&quot; (reprint). The code &#147;NP&#148; was the newspaper Nhan Van (Human
  Knowledge). &quot;CP&quot; represents &quot;Camel Path,&quot; the secret operation in
  Cambodia. The CP is sometimes hidden inside the code such as &#147;T-1-CP-C which could
  show the leaflet was dropped on the Ho Chi Minh Trail as part of Camel Path for Cambodia).
  &#147;ATF&#148; leaflets were printed by the Australians. In addition, there are other
  codes such as &quot;CC,&quot; &quot;F,&quot; &#147;HQ,&#148; &#147;M&#148; (M leaflets
  seem to be all in the Cambodian language), &#147;NT (NT3, NT4 etc.),&#148; &#147;P,&#148;
  &quot;Q,&quot; &quot;S (in Vietnamese or Lao),&quot; SPC (Vietnamese in Laos or on the
  Trail to Laos?) &quot;V,&quot; and &#147;X&#148; (usually has the word &#147;scrap&#148;
  and &#147;without regard to dissemination characteristics&#148; so they may be leaflets
  just printed in blank spaces on sheets to utilize the paper more efficiently). We should
  point out that apparently nobody bothered to record the meaning of the codes or who
  printed the leaflets during the war. Some we have been able to decipher by unit, language
  or message, but many are still unknown today.</p>

  alt="VNP08.jpg (149125 bytes)"></p>
  <p align="center">Leaflet P-08</p>
  <p>Here is one of the leaflets with a code we cannot identify. I have seen at least ten of
  the &#147;P&#148; leaflets. Examples are: P-01 (Where are your comrades?); P-02 (Life in
  South Vietnam); P-04 (Aspects of people&#146;s life in South Vietnam); and P-010 (Where is
  the liberated territory?). The image on P-08 above depicts an American helping a
  Vietnamese with construction. Some of the text is:</p>
  <p align="center"><i>IS THIS IMPERIALISM?</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The United States is the richest and most powerful country in the world. What does
    it need from Vietnam? NOTHING. In fact, it is now giving free Vietnam 40,000,000,000
    piasters in food and economic assistance a year. Is this the new form of
    &#147;imperialism&#148; as propagandized and distorted by the North Vietnamese Communists?</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We mention &#147;Catalog&#148; several times in this article. I have a number of such
  catalogs and their use is explained the 1969 document <i>Employment of U.S. Army
  Psychological Operation Units in Vietnam</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Each PSYOP battalion published a catalog listing 600 to 800 available leaflets. The
    catalog was numerically indexed and gave data on leaflet number, theme, target, size and
    color of the leaflet, together with the leaflet and English translation. Catalogs were
    inventoried and screened periodically to maintain current leaflets. Catalogs were
    distributed to tactical units and PSYOP customers to facilitate ordering specific leaflets
    for the target audience. Action was taken by the 4th PSYOP Group to cross-index leaflet
    catalogs according to PSYOP themes. It was noted that several units initiated or completed
    indexing of catalogs by target audiences as well.</i></p>

  alt="1X6Vietnam.jpg (35269 bytes)"></p>
  <p align="center">Leaflet X-6</p>
  <p>The &#147;X&#148; leaflets are very strange. They seem to fit no pattern and usually
  come with a comment such as &#147;To be disseminated without regard to dissemination
  characteristics with normal leaflet requirements.&#148; In other words, even though
  mathematical formulas were used for most leaflets according to their size and paper weight
  to assure that they would drop on their targets, these &#147;X&#148; leaflets were just
  added to the pile and were allowed to fall wherever they landed. Almost all of the
  &#147;X&#148; leaflets that I have seen are in regard to the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City> Peace talks. The text
  on leaflet X-6 is:</p>
  <p align="center"><i>PEACE</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The Party and the Government of the North will be found guilty by history if they
    don&#146;t end this senseless war.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Vietnamese coded their leaflets with the letters &quot;DV&quot; and a long series
  of numbers afterwards. The &quot;DV&quot; indicated Quan-Doi Viet Nam Cong Hoa (Army of
  the Republic of Vietnam).</p>

  <p align="center">Leaflet DV15AH2268</p>
  <p>Vietnamese PSYOP leaflet DV15AH2268 depicts President Nguyen Van Thieu and clarifies

    <p><i>Lately, with continuous failures in the battlefield, the Communists have spread
    rumors that there will be a Joint Government in the South. Their sole purpose is to create
    confusion among the public. However, the people of the South understand that the rumors of

    cover their military and&nbsp;political failures.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><i>There will be no Joint Government in the South.</i></p>
  <p>The extent of the Allied propaganda effort in Vietnam is told by James William Gibson
  in <i>The Perfect War- Technowar in Vietnam, </i>The Atlantic Monthly Press, NY, 1986:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>From 1965 through 1972 over fifty billion leaflets were distributed in South and
    North Vietnam and along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos and Cambodia; this vast sum was the
    equivalent of more than 1,500 leaflets per person in both the north and the south. In 1969
    the military and civilian propaganda apparatuses produced over 10.5 billion leaflets, 4
    million pamphlets, &nbsp;60,000 newspaper articles, over 24.5 million posters, and nearly
    12 million magazines.</i></p>

  <p align="center"><>Press sheet</p>
  <p>The uncut sheet depicted above consists of a mixture of propaganda leaflets in the
  Vietnamese language and represents a sample press sheet from the small format, high speed
  Hancho web presses. Two of them were used to print leaflets during the 1966-1967 periods.

  million in 1968. MACV could produce 200,000 3x6-inch leaflets per eight-hour shift on its
  Harris high-speed press. The PSYWAR Directorate had a Webendorf Press that that SOG was
  authorized to use from 1600-2400. It could produce 500,000 leaflets per shift. In
  addition, the deception mail operation produced 200 fake letters per month of various
  types to be mailed into <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>
  <p>The black letter program was constantly being fine-tuned. A MACVSOG comment on the
  subject states:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>We plan to use notional leftist organizations abroad as originators of the letters,
    but are beginning with a true leftist Japanese fishing organization. In line with this, we
    are soon going to use a Paris-based Vietnamese, pro-Hanoi student organization&#146;s
    magazine to infiltrate subtle anti-Communist propaganda into <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place> by making
    slight changes in some of the articles&#133;</em></p>
    <p><em>We will experiment in the printed media field, for example; calendars, fishing
    hints, and tide tables are presently being obtained. Varying paper stocks are now being
    used.<o:p></em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As the war progressed the black letter output went from 3,993 in 1965 to 6,000 in 1966
  and 7,550 in 1967. The letters were mailed from <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>, <st1:City w:st="on"> Paris</st1:City>, Hong Kong, <st1:City w:st="on">Bangkok</st1:City> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tokyo</st1:place></st1:City>,
  allegedly from North Vietnamese living outside the country. There were nine general themes
  for the letters: Weakness in Communist ideology; Revision in North Vietnam; Chinese
  imperialism; North Vietnamese mismanagement; Peace; Free Enterprise; Free society;
  Resistance movements and the Chieu Hoi program. The letters were coded according to type:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Special</i>: High level hard sell propaganda (400 letters per month).<br>
    <i>Vulcan</i>: High and medium level with a revisionist point of view. (50-60 letters per
    week).<br>
    <i>Thor</i>: A personal letter with soft sell and human interest. (15 letters a week)<br>
    <i>Mars</i>: To next-of-kin of battlefield casualties. (10 letters per week)<br>
    <i>Luna</i>: Exploitation of captured Viet Cong letters. (as available)</p>

  <p>I should mention here that we discuss black SOG operations in greater depth in our
  article on the <a href="SSPLVietnam.html">Sacred Sword of the Patriots League</a>. Readers
  interested in black operations are encouraged to read that article for more information on
  the &#147;dirty tricks&#148; of the Vietnam War.</p>
  <p>In Volume I of the Department of Defense contracted <i>the Final Report Psychological
  Operations Studies &#150; Vietnam</i>, Human Sciences Research Inc, 1971, Drs. Ernest F.
  and Edith M. Bairdain mention the value of leaflets:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>In regard to the best means for disseminating the Allied message among the Viet
    Cong, members who rallied to the government stated that 99% saw propaganda leaflets, 100%
    heard airborne loudspeakers, 98% saw radio sets, 34% saw newspapers, 13% saw magazines, 9%
    heard ground loudspeakers, 7% read posters, 4% saw television sets and just 1% saw PSYOP
    novelty items. Of the enemy who saw the leaflets, 81% of the VC and 97% of the NVA
    actually read them. Of the enemy who heard the airborne loudspeakers, 89% of the VC and
    98% of the NVA actually listened to the message. The authors point out that this
    demonstrates that leaflets, airborne loudspeakers, and radio are the best methods to reach
    Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army personnel. </i></p>

  <p>Although Americans like to believe that they invented PSYOP and are the masters of the
  art, the Vietnamese were practicing PSYOP early in their war against the Communists. On 1
  July 1953 the Vietnamese Army had two PSYOP companies to conduct propaganda in the 1st and
  2nd Military Regions (Later Corps Tactical Zones). On 1 January 1958 the unit was renamed
  the <st1:place w:st="on">Mobile</st1:place> Cultural Battalion. On 1 November 1959 it was renamed a PSYWAR Battalion. On 1
  March 1963 a decision was made to form 3 PSYWAR Battalions and the original unit became
  the 1st PSYWAR Battalion headquartered in <st1:place w:st="on">Saigon</st1:place>. The 2nd and 3rd PSYWAR battalions would
  be assigned to the 2nd and 3rd CTZs headquartered in Pleiku and Da Nang with a 4th
  battalion planned to be activated in the 1964-1965 time frame for the 4th CTZ.</p>

  <p align="center">A Vietnamese Army Loudspeaker Truck<br>
  Not exactly up to U.S. Standards, but apparently it did the job</p>
  <p>As an ARVN tactical unit the mission of the battalion was local civic action to promote
  confidence in the government, to win the people from the influence of the enemy and to
  encourage the people to stand up against the communists; troop morale operations among
  ARVN forces to promote a fighting spirit and a strong determination to win, to promote
  discipline and a willingness to sacrifice one&#146;s life for the nation and the people;
  and PSYOP campaigns against the enemy to break their fighting will and to cause them to
  surrender. The original single battalion consisted of 602 men, but under the new
  organization, each battalion was authorized 367 men. The battalions have the ability to
  produce white, grey and black propaganda using leaflets, loudspeakers, printed material,
  photographs and documents. Each battalion supports a corps, the companies support
  divisions, the groups support regiments and the PSYWAR teams support battalions.</p>
  <p>After the 1963 reorganization the ARVN PSYWAR battalion consisted of a Headquarters and
  Headquarters Company, a Technical Company, and three PSYWAR Companies. The Technical
  Company was comprised of a Special Operations Platoon, a Cultural Platoon, a Radio
  Augmentation Platoon and a Press Platoon. Each of the PSYWAR Companies was made up of six
  PSYWAR Teams.</p>

  <p align="center">Vietnamese PSYOP structure</p>
  <p>The Vietnamese PSYOP structure was designed after that of the Republic of <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
  </p>
  <p>Curiously, the structure was first called the Russian Political Commissar System. In
  the Communist system, the military commander was subordinate to the political Commissar.
  The system was then adopted by the Communist Chinese. Again, the Political Commissar
  insured that the military stay subordinate to the Party. When the Nationalists were driven
  to Taiwan, they took this system with them but changed it so that the military commander
  was in charge. That same system was adopted by the Vietnamese. The military commander is
  superior in authority to the Political officer so there is a unity of command. In 1960,
  Vietnamese President Diem visited Taiwan and while there was introduced to this system of
  PSYOP. By 1964 Taiwan and the United States had worked together to establish a Political
  Warfare system for Vietnam. More of the background of Vietnamese POLWAR can be found in <i>The
  Political Warfare Guide for Advisors </i>printed by MACV.<O:P></p>

  U.S. forces were advised that because of the peculiar Vietnamese system, a POLWAR
  Battalion was not to be considered the equivalent of a PSYOP Battalion. </p>
  <p>The Vietnamese 10th Political Warfare (POLWAR) Battalion worked in I Corps with the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><ST1:COUNTRY-REGION u1:st="on"><ST1:PLACE u1:st="on">U.S.</ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION></st1:place></st1:country-region>

  printing facilities were integrated. The 10th POLWAR consisted of four PSYWAR Companies, a
  technical and administrative company, and a cultural drama platoon. Each PSYWAR Company
  contained five Civic Action teams, one intelligence team, and one indoctrination team. The
  first priority of the POLWAR Battalion was command information; informing and
  indoctrinating friendly military forces. The second priority was winning over the civilian
  population, and the third was PSYOP efforts aimed at the enemy. The POLWAR Battalion
  worked under ARVN Corps Control, Often at division level, and with <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on"><ST1:COUNTRY-REGION u1:st="on"><ST1:PLACE u1:st="on">U.S.</ST1:COUNTRY-REGION></ST1:PLACE></st1:place></st1:country-region> advisors available

  <p>In a Vietnamese-language article entitled &#147;Coastal Raiders&#148; translated by
  Donald C. Brewster, Tran Do <st1:place w:st="on">Cam</st1:place> talks about Vietnamese psychological operations. He
  mentions several operations:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Leaflet drops usually took place in the highly populated areas south of the 18th
    Parallel. </i></p>
    <p><i>Large quantities of leaflets were placed in the shell of an 81mm mortar that was
    fired into the coastal villages and communities from the fast patrol boats when they were
    1,500 to 2,000 meters offshore. The shell would explode overhead like a flare and the
    leaflets would flutter down from the sky. </i></p>
    <p><i>Sometimes the fast patrol boats also distributed radios wrapped in waterproof
    plastic in the villages along the coast so that the population could listen to South
    Vietnamese radio stations such as the Voice of Freedom (Ti�ng N�i Tu Do), Mother of
    Vietnam (Me Vi�t Nam) or the Sacred Sword of Patriotism (G��m Thi�n �i Qu�c). </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A former agent informs me that Brewster is incorrect with his comment about Mother
  Vietnam Radio. He stated that Mother Vietnam radio came into existence after MACV-SOG had
  phased out such boat operations.<o:p></o:p></p>

  classified <i>A Short Guide to Psychological Operations in the Republic of Vietnam</i> in
  1965.&nbsp; Authors Jeanne Mintz, Herbert Silverberg and James Trinnaman say about radio
  operations:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>In 1965 there were 11 radio stations in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> broadcasting 120 hours a day. (This
    does not include the &#147;Voice of Freedom&#148; PSYOP broadcasts). The stations were
    located in Saigon, Hue, Quang Nhai, Qui Nhon, Banmethuot, Nha Trang, Dalat, Ba Xuyen, Hoi
    An, Tuy Hoa and Tan An. The <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hue</st1:place></st1:City> station was used by the ARVN for propaganda broadcasts. Of
    course, the Voice of American also broadcast on a great number of frequencies to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Voice of Freedom (VOF) was a major player in the &#147;black&#148; radio operation.
  Declassified documents show that it produced 76 different programs weekly with
  commentaries in Vietnamese, English and French. Some of the program titles are; Vietnamese
  Traditional Music, Sounds of Poetry, Returnees Songs, the Roman Catholic program, the
  Buddhist program, Activities Abroad and at Home, the Daily Battle Scene, News Analysis,
  Propaganda and Truth, the Open Arms program and Liberation Deeds. </p>
  <p>A knowledgeable source says that the SORO description of the Voice of Freedom as a
  &quot;black&quot;station is wrong.&nbsp; At most it was &quot;gray.&quot;</p>
  <p>Other black Allied radio stations included the SOG fake Radio Hanoi clone broadcast
  from Number 7 Hong Tap Street in Saigon; Radio Red Flag, the voice of an alleged breakaway
  North Vietnamese Communist Party faction; and the CIA station Red Star Radio, allegedly a
  dissident Communist group in South Vietnam. The small fixed-station radios disseminated to
  the North Vietnamese by the Allies were codenamed &#147;peanuts.&#148; </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>There are five CAS-operated radio stations, three broadcasting in Vietnamese and two
    in Khmer. Mother Vietnam Station, with a Tokyo Rose approach, broadcasts a daily basic
    three hour program on five transmitters. The Sacred Sword of the Patriotic League radio
    station, a black operation pointed toward <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>, broadcasts five hours a day. The Voice of
    Nam-Bo Liberation, a black operation directed at communists within <st1:country-region w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:country-region>
    broadcasts to the Mekong delta and <st1:place w:st="on">Central Vietnam</st1:place>. The Voice of Khmer programs are much
    the same as Mother Vietnam, and a black station, the Voice of the Popular Front of
    Indochina appears to come from Hanoi but injects divisiveness between Vietnamese
    communists and their Khmer allies.</i></p>
    <p><i>The Voice of <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region> reaches <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City> from two medium wave transmitters. Big Squirt at <st1:City w:st="on">Hue</st1:City>
    and a million-watt transmitter in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</i></p>
    <p><i>Radio broadcasting by the Government of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> consists of the Voice of Freedom and
    two VTVN national radio stations. Channel A broadcasts 18 hours a day and can be heard by
    North Vietnamese troops in the Vietnam-Cambodia border area. Channel B is the Political
    Warfare station and broadcasts 18 hours a day to the Vietnamese armed forces and their
    dependents.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The comment about &quot;five CAS-operated radio stations&quot; means that they were
  &quot;controlled American source&quot; stations and the term was used in government
  documents as a euphemism for CIA.</p>
  <p>What did the Viet Cong think of these radio stations? A 23 May 1967 classified
  confidential report translates a captured Viet Cong document. In it, the Party complains
  that many leaders, cadre and soldiers are listening to enemy broadcasts and reading enemy
  leaflets. They blame this political error on lack of ideological consciousness and lax
  discipline. It lists those who are allowed to listen to the broadcasts, such as members of
  their own propaganda teams who need to know what the enemy is thinking and other political
  cadre, and then goes on to say in part:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Aside from the above mentioned comrades, no cadre are authorized to listen to enemy
    broadcasts and to read or keep enemy documents.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The document recommends a private counseling for a first infraction, a public
  counseling for a second infraction, and a reprimand for a third infraction.</p>

  Viet Cong into complying with the terms of the ceasefire agreement recently signed in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Paris</st1:City></st1:place>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  station effectively featured a seductive female voice, nostalgic music, and plenty of soft
  news meant to bury its political message deep in the sentimental appeal that the common
  Motherland of all Vietnamese at last deserved peace and the end of bloodshed. It was a
  &#147;grey&#148; radio station and moderate in comparison to other propaganda efforts. The
  station encouraged North Vietnamese soldiers to defect to the South and sought to break
  their morale. </p>

  <p align="center">Viet Cong Colonel Tam Ha</p>
  <p>Another member of the radio station staff was a former Viet Cong political commissar, a
  colonel whom was still addressed by his old Viet Cong name, <i>Tam Ha</i>. Just before the
  Viet Cong launched the May 1968 second phase of their Tet Offensive, Tam Ha came over to
  the Government side bearing the complete tactical plan for the second VC attempt to
  &#147;liberate&#148; <st1:place w:st="on">Saigon</st1:place>. Thanks to him, the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> and Vietnamese troops deployed to

  <p>On 20 April 1975, as South Vietnam was about to fall, the CIA sent all 144 staff
  members and their families, totaling about 1000 people and equipment to Phu Quoc Island
  off the coast of South Vietnam. The refugees were then picked up by the cargo ship
  &#147;Pioneer Challenger&#148; and moved to Guam, from where they were eventually
  resettled in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region></st1:place>.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Throughout the program's nearly five years it was continuously headed by the late Jim
  Welch. He came to Saigon because &quot;Nixon went to <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>,&quot; so Jim had to close down

  <p>There is also a record of a PSYWAR Bureau. A mention of this organization is found in <i>Monthly

  Naval Forces <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. There is a long list of operations that were Civic Action or PSYOP.
  We can&#146;t tell in most cases which were Vietnamese and which was American, but in some
  specific instances the Vietnamese are identified: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The PSYWAR Bureau issued 22,900 magazines, 52,400 posters, and 91,500 leaflets to
    Vietnamese and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> units for further distribution. In a special project in conjunction

  <p align="center">MACV-SOG</p>
  <p align="left">Military activities were officially described as providing assistance to
  the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Within the Military Assistance Command
  Vietnam, the Studies and Observation Group (MACV-SOG) was charged with conducting
  unconventional warfare, including <a href="sog.html">black propaganda</a>. </p>
  <p>According to author John Plaster, <i>SOG: The Secret Wars of America's Commandos in
  Vietnam,</i> <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Simon</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">&amp;</st1:State> <st1:State w:st="on">Schuster</st1:State>, <st1:State w:st="on">New York</st1:State></st1:place>, 1997:<o:p></o:p></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The Studies and Observations Group did not answer to MACV or its commander, General
    William Westmoreland; it answered directly to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon.
    Officially, SOG&nbsp;answered solely to the Special Assistant for Counterinsurgency and
    Special Activities, a two-star general whose small staff responded only to the Joint
    Chiefs' operations officer (J-3), with unprecedented direct access to the Chairman of the
    Joint Chiefs.&nbsp; Any money SOG needed would be buried in the Navy's annual budget.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Allen B. Clark adds in <i>Valor in Vietnam: Chronicles of Honor, Courage, and
  Sacrifice: 1963-1977,</i> Casemate, 2013:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The acronym SOG, standing for Studies and Observation Group, was a euphemism for a
    semiautonomous element of the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, which in fact
    answered directly to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington (in the person of the Special
    Assistant for Counterinsurgency and Special Activities). The SOG mission was conduct of
    clandestine operations throughout Southeast Asia by U.S. members of the various services
    and by indigenous personnel. Agent insertions, ambushes and raids, rescue missions, deep
    reconnaissance, and interdiction were among the typical SOG cross-border missions. SOG was
    established with a chain of command outside MACV channels. SOG would answer directly to
    the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon via a special liaison, the special assistant for
    counter-insurgency and special activities (SACSA). In Saigon only General Westmoreland and
    four non-SOG officers were even briefed on SOG.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Another explanation of SOG and its duties is found here:</p>
  <p>The Studies and Observations Group was a joint unconventional warfare task force
  created on 24 January 1964 by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a subsidiary command of the
  Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). The unit would eventually consist primarily
  of personnel from the United States Army Special Forces, the United States Navy SEALs, the
  United States Air Force, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and elements of the United
  States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance units.</p>
  <p>The Special Operations Group (as the unit was initially titled) was in fact controlled
  by the Special Assistant for Counterinsurgency and Special Activities (SACSA) and his
  staff at the Pentagon. This arrangement was necessary since SOG needed some listing in the
  MACV table of organization and the fact that MACV's commander, General William
  Westmoreland, had no authority to conduct operations outside territorial South Vietnam.
  This command arrangement through SACSA also allowed tight control (up to the presidential
  level) of the scope and scale of the organization's operations.<O:P></O:P></p>
  <p>The mission of the organization was to execute an intensified program of harassment,
  diversion, political pressure, capture of prisoners, physical destruction, acquisition of
  intelligence, generation of propaganda, and diversion of resources, against the Democratic
  Republic of Vietnam.</p>
  <p>These operations (OPLAN 34-Alpha) were conducted in an effort to convince North Vietnam
  to cease its sponsorship of the communist insurgency in South Vietnam. Similar operations

  <b><p>Special Operations Augmentation Command and Control Central (SOACCC) was formed in

  responsibility for classified unconventional warfare operations throughout the tri-border
  regions of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. It had around 30 Spike Reconnaissance Teams (RT).
  Hatchet Forces, and four Search-Location-and-Annihilation Mission Companies (SLAM
  Companies A, B, C and D). Originally named after states (Arizona, New Mexico, etc.), RTs
  later adopted names of Asian poisonous snakes and assorted designations once all state
  names had been exhausted. </p>
  <p>Special Operations Augmentation Command and Control North (SOACCN) was formed in
  November 1967 and departed Vietnam in March 1971. It was assigned conduct of classified
  special unconventional warfare missions into Laos and North Vietnam. It was composed of
  Spike reconnaissance teams, Hatchet forces and lettered SLAM companies. Missions into
  North Vietnam were initiated as early as I February 1964 under Operation Plan 34A.
  Operations into Laos commenced in September 1965 as part of Operation SHINING BRASS,
  renamed PRAIRIE FIRE in 1968. In 1971 the Laotian operations were given the code name PHU
  DUNG.</p>
  <p>Special Operations Augmentation Command and Control South (SOACCS) was formed in
  November 1967 and departed Vietnam in March 1971. It was located in Ban Me Thuot and
  created when permission was granted to conduct cross-border missions into Cambodia. It was
  engaged in classified special unconventional warfare missions inside VC-dominated South
  Vietnam and throughout Cambodia. It contained Spike reconnaissance teams, Hatchet forces,
  and four SLAM companies. Cross-border operations had been conducted into northeastern
  Cambodia since May 1967 under Project DANIEL BOONE, later known as SALEM HOUSE. In 1971
  the name was changed to THOT NOT. </p>
  <p>There has been some confusion about the Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). One trooper who
  was an early OP-35 member stated that prior to 1968, CCN, CCC &amp; CCS were called FOBs.
  He believed that of the four, FOB1 later became the CCN, FOB 2 &amp; 3 combined to form
  the CCC, and FOB4 became the CCS. However, another member who was an officer recalls:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>At that time CCN, CCC and CCS were not called FOB&#146;s and I doubt that they
    ever were.&nbsp; The FOB&#146;s were sub-sets of the Command and Control organizations.
    For Example: under CCN, FOB-1 was at Phu Bai, FOB-3 was at Khe Sanh, and FOB-4 at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Marble</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mountain</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
    in Danang. I think that FOB-2 in Kontum was originally part of CCN but I could be
    wrong.&nbsp; Nevertheless, CCC was not formed until late 1968 and located in Kontum.&nbsp;
    Roy Barr, one of my FOB-3 commanders became the first Commander of CCC.&nbsp; So I believe
    the Nov. 1967 date is wrong.</i></b></p>

  January 1965 using a NC-121J Lockheed Super-Constellation shell. Blue Eagle I was the
  first project aircraft and configured to do AM, FM, and SW radio broadcast missions. A
  crew of naval officers and enlisted personnel was selected. Operational and flight
  training began in July 1965. The aircraft was sent to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place> shortly afterwards where in
  October it broadcast the World Series to American troops and became the world&#146;s first

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>In Project Jenny, a U.S. Navy EC-121 aircraft broadcast SOG radio programs while

    finders and, because the radio wasn&#146;t far away, tended to overwhelm local station
    signals.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This was a highly classified mission and most of the crew did not know they were
  working for at the time. In 2001, personnel who served with SOG were awarded the
  Presidential Unit Citation by direction of President George Bush.</p>
  <p>Robbins continues:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>After 1970, the Blue Eagles were retired to the bone yard to lick their war wounds
    and the Navy got out of the airborne broadcasting business. The U.S. Air Force then&nbsp;
    took over these missions with Coronet Solo broadcast birds (which were essentially remakes
    of the navy birds) and ultimately the Commando Solo EC-130 airborne broadcast platforms
    currently flown by the Pennsylvania Air National Guard 193rd Special Operations Wing.

  <p>It is also interesting to note that in order to make the TV programs work as a

  500 television sets for <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place>. They were placed in public squares, store windows, or

  <p align="center">Beach Jumper Insignia</p>
  <p>The United States Navy tactical cover and deception units were called Beach Jumpers.
  The units were founded in WWII and used again during the Vietnam War. There were over a
  dozen detachments and teams. Some of their psychological operations were:</p>
  <p>Beach Jumpers Unit 1 Detachment A was responsible for employing PSYOP which&nbsp;would
  become one of the Beach Jumpers' Vietnam missions and later, their unclassified cover
  activity. This included propaganda leaflet drops and loudspeaker broadcasts, which
  Detachment A conducted during all major operations in 1966.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Detachment D conducted psychological operations in support of Task Forces 115, 116, and
  117 operating in the Mekong Delta of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place>. </p>
  <p>Detachment F rode River Patrol Boats conducting psychological operation on the Cua Viet
  and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Hue</st1:City></st1:place> rivers in northernmost I Corps. It dropped over 260,000 leaflets during Operation
  &#147;Daring Rebel&#148; which was a multi-battalion assault on the Hoi An area against
  the Viet Cong. The leaflets carried rally themes of Chieu Hoi,&nbsp;population control
  directives, and pleas for local population assistance. Aerial broadcasts, which followed
  the leaflet drops, carried the same themes and were made by Vietnamese liaison
  personnel.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Team 13 conducted psychological operations from River Patrol Boats on all waterways in
  country. Additionally they supported both Army 5th Special Forces A and B Teams and Navy
  SEALS. For their efforts, Beach Jumper Unit One Team 13 was presented the Navy Unit
  Commendation which said in part:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Beach Jumper Unit 1, Team 13 operated with units of the United States Navy, the
    United States Army, and the Vietnamese Navy In carrying out psychological operations and
    combat missions of a classified nature. By April 1971, the Team had established
    detachments throughout the IV Corps area, effectively covering the fifteen provinces of
    the <st1:place w:st="on">Mekong</st1:place> Delta with their diversified psychological operations capabilities; including
    loudspeaker broadcast equipment, leaflet drops, civic action projects, and other
    techniques. </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>John B. Dwyer tells us more in <i>Seaborne Deception, the History of the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region> <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"> Navy</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Beach</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
  Jumpers.</i></p>
  <p>The Beach Jumpers often took part in deception operations. For instance, in order to
  fool the Viet Cong and make them think that PBRs were in the area when they were in fact
  back at base refueling:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Team 13 transmitted prerecorded helicopter background noises and simulated chopper
    voice traffic over PBR primary communications circuits&#133;Conducted only at night, the
    notional transmissions were varied to avoid stereotyping and to ensure credibility.</i></p>

      1971. It depicts a helicopter trying to draw some VC fire while a heavily armed Cobra
      waits overhead.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Other operations include:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>During Operation Lam Son 19 (the Multidivisional incursion into the Laotian
    Panhandle) SOG carried out diversionary insertions at four bogus landing zones and
    conducted simulated parachute raider and actual resupply bundle insertions at eight phone
    drop zones&#133; </i></p>
    <p><i>Flying in Army helicopters they played taped music&#133;over enemy territory. The
    purpose&#133;was to draw enemy fire in order to pinpoint the location of the Viet Cong on
    the ground. Orbiting gunships would then swoop down for the kill&#133;The heavy metal rock
    music selection by Iron Butterfly was the most effective noise for drawing enemy fire. </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Lieutenant Commander C. R. Hershey, Commander of Beach Jumper 1 discussed his unit
  capabilities and recommended that the PSYOP capabilities of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> Navy be expanded in a
  report entitled &#147;Concepts for the Employment of PSYOP within the Pacific Fleet.&#148;
  Some of his comments are:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The successful employment of psychological operations, within varying situational
    requirements and geographical locations, requires a flexibility of responses and mobility
    to deploy rapidly&#133;The Navy, with these inherent capabilities, stands ready to conduct
    PSYOP where troops have not yet been placed ashore&#133;It is mandatory that the
    Navy&#146;s ability to conduct psychological operations should not be allowed to become
    dormant between conflicts.</i></p>
    <p><i>The Navy&#146;s large combatant ships and many of the smaller vessels have organic
    graphic arts, duplicating and photographic facilities which are supported by trained
    personnel&#133;The core of personnel, although small in number would include billets for
    military and civilian experts who have an educational background and training in the
    political and social sciences. Of course, the necessary skills required by photography,
    lithography and electronic would be acquired from military schools&#133;This group would
    be mobile and flexible, in that they could deploy to any area to assist the commander in
    psychological operations on very short notice and could expand rapidly under the aegis of
    the task force or another commander.</i></p>
    <p><i>There is currently a naval command, which is the only permanent naval unit tasked
    with the conduct of psychological operations&#133;Upon being tasked with PSYOP during the
    Vietnam War, this naval unit was quick to respond in acquiring the additional skills and
    training necessary to take timely advantage of the fleet&#146;s organic leaflet production
    and disseminating facilities as well as employing its own broadcasting equipment&#133;For
    example: the unit has been able to print leaflets, containing a defector&#146;s statement
    and photograph and disseminate it over the target area in less than six hours&#133;I am
    the Commanding Officer of Beach Jumper Unit 1 and the organizations that I have been
    referring to as meeting the above requirements are the Navy&#146;s Beach Jumper
    Units&#133;The Beach Jumper Units can be the Navy&#146;s mobile and effective nucleus for
    PSYOP.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We mention above that the Navy would fly loudspeaker aircraft to draw fire and then use
  gunships to attack the Viet Cong. The Army sometimes did the same thing. I should point
  out here that this is not the way to get the enemy&#146;s trust. A PSYOP Lieutenant
  recalls:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>I remember when the PSYOP squadron I worked for got shot up particularly bad one
    night while playing Robert Brown's &quot;Fire&quot; to the Viet Cong over the big
    University 1000-Watt speaker. The next night they went up again but &#147;Spooky&#148;
    flew with them.&nbsp;Our speaker plane flew a wide orbit playing &quot;Fire&quot; again,
    and Spooky flew opposing orbit.&nbsp;It was night and the speaker plane was lit up like a
    Christmas tree to draw attention. Spooky was blacked out. The enemy opened fire with
    everything they had.&nbsp;Spooky opened up with all three miniguns on at high cyclic rate
    and mysteriously all of the ground fire suddenly ceased. </i></p>

  <p align="center">An alleged CIA forged Viet Cong stamp</p>
  <p>It was not only the military that produced black propaganda. There is an alleged
  propaganda postage stamp printed by the Central Intelligence Agency. According to the <i>Vietnam
  Postage Stamp Collection of the Armed Struggle for the Fatherland Safeguard, </i>Tran
  Quang Vy, The 1964 10 xu stamp commemorated the victory at Ap Bac on 2-3 January 1963.
  This was the first major victory of the Viet Cong over a full division of the Army of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South
  Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> (ARVN). Although the South Vietnamese forces were supported by artillery, tanks
  and helicopters, they suffered 200 killed and another 300 wounded. Five American
  helicopters were shot down during the battle. The vignette on the stamp depicts a Viet
  Cong machine-gunner downing an American CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The stamp was catalogued
  by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Stanley Gibbons</i> as NLF5.<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p><i>Western Stamp Coillector</i> published an article on 5 April 1982 entitled
  &#147;Ex-Agent&#146;s charges suggest CIA forged Viet Cong stamp.&#148; The story told of
  an interview in <i>The Washington Post</i> where former Central Intelligence Agency member
  Frank Liechty stated that he saw sheets of the Viet Cong stamps in a CIA file in the
  1960s. He claimed that documents in the file described an agency plan to fabricate
  evidence of outside support of the Viet Cong. The high quality of the printing would
  indicate to all that they were produced in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City> because the guerrillas in the south could
  not produce such stamps. Liechty claimed that the CIA intended to send letters written in
  Vietnamese all over the world and to journalists as part of a plan to facilitate greater <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
  involvement in the Vietnam War. He said that the stamp appeared on the cover of <i
  style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Life Magazine</i> dated 26 February 1965, two days
  before President Lyndon B. Johnson published his &#147;White Paper&#148; on the war. A
  week later, two Marine Corps battalions were sent to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Liechty was fired in 1978
  and depending on who you believe he is either a disgruntled ex-employee or an agent with a
  conscience that the CIA could no longer control.</p>

    in the fake an unexplained&nbsp;extra graphic element which connects the &#147;M&#148; and

  years ago for $2,000 but did not sell. I was later offered the same stamp for a bargain
  price of $1,750.00. I pointed out to the dealer that a sheet of 20 stamps had sold for
  $6,000, so that indicated that an individual stamp is actually worth about $300.</p>

  <p align="left">Although elements of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) prepared
  some white propaganda leaflets, much of the white printed propaganda of the Vietnam War
  was produced under MACV by two U.S. Army Psychological Operations (PSYOP) Groups. For Army
  organizational purposes (probably beginning in the early 1960s), South Vietnam was divided
  into four Corps Tactical Zones. Ranging from the north to the south, I Corps was in the
  north abutting North Vietnam, in the foothills and coastal regions east of the Annamite
  Mountains; II Corps was in the country's least populated region, encompassing the rugged
  central highlands and central plateau; III Corps was on the densely populated alluvial
  plain surrounding Saigon; IV Corps was the heavily populated and agriculturally productive<o:p>
  Mekong Delta.</p>

    <p><b><i>When I was there we only had three web presses. They must have brought in more
    presses after I left in 1968. Looks like some walls may have been taken out to fit all the
    equipment in there. I loved my tour with PSYOP. It was my first duty assignment with the
    Army. I was a typist doing final drafts of propaganda scripts from previous drafts that
    had been corrected with pencil. After a while I wanted a bit more action so I asked to
    change jobs. I was then assigned to the Art Department and worked alongside Mike Peters.
    He became a well-known cartoonist after leaving the military. I then became a press-helper
    in the Printing Plant. I really enjoyed that job because I got to move around and get some
    exercise.</i></b></p>

  <p align="left">The 7th PSYOP Group was constituted 19 August 1965 in the regular Army and
  activated 20 October 1965 and assigned to the Ryukyu Islands, located in the Machinato
  Service Area. It was attached to IX Corps for operation and Training. The 7th PSYOP Group
  was the successor to the U. S. Army Broadcasting and Visual Activity, Pacific, (USABVAPAC)
  which was disbanded 20 October 1965. The 7th assumed all missions and functions previously
  administered by USABVAPAC and transferred members and equipment.</p>
  <p align="left">The 7th PSYOP Group was tasked with support activities in Okinawa,
  Vietnam, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand and Japan. The group consisted of the 14th PSYOP
  Battalion, the 15th PSYOP Detachment, the Japan Detachment, the Korea detachment, the
  Taiwan Detachment, and the Vietnam Detachment.</p>
  <p><b>The <st1:country-region w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region> detachment was located at North <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Camp</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Drake</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. It produced the magazines <i>Koryu,

  <p align="left">In Vietnam the Group worked in support of the Commander, United States
  Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (COMUSMACV). During 1965 The Okinawa printing plant
  produced 125 million leaflets for MACV and the Vietnam Detachment produced another 62
  million on its web-fed press in Saigon. The Detachment maintained liaison with the Joint
  United States Public Affairs Office and the Military Assistance Command Political Warfare
  Directorate. In September two members journeyed to Vietnam to plan and conduct the first
  high altitude leaflet and toy bundle dissemination over North Vietnam. They returned again
  in December to assist in a Christmas toy drop over North Vietnam.</p>
  <p><b>In March 1967, the detachment took part in the production of a bar of soap with
  eight different PSYOP messages that became visible as the soap was used. 25,000 bars of
  soap were ready for the annual Tet campaign of February 1969. One former officer from the
  group told me that the soap propaganda caused some hand chaffing in the unit when everyone
  in his office was ordered to wash their hands over and over again to test out the use of
  soap bars and see how long it took the new messages to appear.</b></p>
  <p>The 7th Group Detachment produced about 800,000,000 leaflets a month for the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
  forces in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 1968. They worked with JUSPAO to print 2,000,000 copies bi-weekly of
  the PSYOP newspaper <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tu Do</i> (Free South). The
  detachment also printed six different calendars with a run of 1,720,000 copies and six

  <p align="left">SP4 William Boyle was a member of the 7th PSYOP Group in <st1:place w:st="on">Okinawa</st1:place>. He said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Our unit had a detachment in <st1:country-region w:st="on">South Korea</st1:country-region>, another in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region>, and had sent some
    members temporary duty (TDY) to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Viet Nam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In May 1965, a larger TDY detachment (about 20
    of us) was sent to Bien Hoa attached to the 173rd Airborne Brigade. We were quartered at
    an old French villa near the river that was already used by the Special Forces. We set up
    shop in Bien Hoa and used our portable (tractor-trailer carried) presses to print leaflets
    which we dropped from specially outfitted C-47's, &nbsp;which were also used as
    loudspeaker platforms for night missions over Viet Cong territory). </p>
    <p>In June 1965, an American Special Forces A camp was overrun. We went to help
    reestablish the nearby village, which had been largely destroyed in the battle. We
    operated on the principle that civic action was an integral part of the effort to win the
    hearts and minds of the people, and visited many hamlets, villages, and towns to evaluate
    the needs - whether emergency food supplies or construction materials or improvements in
    public services (schools and clinics). </i></p>
    <p><i>During the time I was in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Nam</st1:country-region> our detachment was assigned to the 173rd Airborne, the
    Military Assistant Command <st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> Army <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>
    <p>I spent many hours in choppers and little fixed wing bush planes, along with many hours
    in C47's on both day and night missions. My tour ended in May, 1966, and until then the
    unit had suffered no direct enemy attacks. </i></p>

  from 30 November 1968 to 16 May 1972.&nbsp;After four years he was superbly qualified to
  discuss some of the problems he faced during his multiple tours. Some of the points he
  makes in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>his Senior Officer Debriefing report
  are:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>One major problem regarding PSYOP is the lack of understanding and appreciation for
    PSYOP by some senior military commanders. Although the situation has improved somewhat
    during the past decade, there are still some senior commanders who do not fully recognize
    the importance of the PSYOP weapons system as it is employed in a politico-military
    conflict situation. </i></p>
    <p><i>One perennial problem that confronted the 7th PSYOP Group was the fact that not all
    officers assigned to the group had formal PSYOP training or experience.</i></p>
    <p><i>It appears that the U. S. Army is deficient in the number of qualified
    printers&#133;Such personnel shortages seriously reduce the requisite flexibility
    necessary to support strategic operations&#133;</i></p>
    <p><i>The Group was responsible for printing approximately 80% of all the PSYOP printing
    requirements for Vietnam&#133;The Group had to utilize three printing plants, The USIA
    Regional Service Center in Manila, the U.S. Army Printing and Publications Center in
    Japan, and the 7th PSYOP Group printing plant.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Retired Colonel Charles V. Nahlik talks about flying leaflet missions over Vietnam
  for the 7th PSYOP Group as a Captain from 1966 to 1968:&nbsp;</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>In support of Vietnam, the 7th PSYOP Group was given a schedule by Military
    Assistance Command Vietnam and flew missions once a month via the C-130s.&nbsp;We flew
    into Ubon AFB Thailand the day before and flew the mission the following evening.&nbsp;We
    sat with the fighter jocks for the evening briefing, jumped into our survival vest,
    checked maps and weapons and took off.&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the wind direction, we
    either flew up the Ho Chi Minh trail and then along and below the demilitarized zone or
    we&nbsp;flew up the east coast of North Vietnam.&nbsp;When we dropped leaflets along the
    Ho Chi Minh Trail we took lots of fire from the Mu Giah pass. Our electronic jammers were
    working to their fullest but we still saw the rockets coming up at us. That is something
    that will start your heart pumping! However, none of that was as frightening
    as&nbsp;dropping leaflets from one of those tiny O2B aircraft out of Can Tho with a pilot
    who thought he should have been flying&nbsp;in an attack aircraft.&nbsp;I was dropping
    leaflets while he was diving at the enemy, dropping grenades and shooting&nbsp;a rifle out
    the window at Viet Cong in the bush below us. &#147;Pure Crazy&#148; is the way I would
    describe that experience.</i></b></p>

  <p align="center">Anh Khe, September 1965</p>
  <p>The 19th PSYOP Company was activated at Ft. Bragg as part of the 3rd Special Forces
  Group on 10 August 1962. The first Commander was Captain Blaine Revis. In July 1965, Revis

  formed, trained and deployed to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> in just two weeks.&nbsp;The detachment arrived in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>
  in September 1965 and assigned to support the 1st Cavalry Division G5 Section at Anh Khe.
  The Section was understaffed for communicating with the Vietnamese populace and the
  laborers who would prepare the base for the arrival of aircraft. It soon became apparent
  that the Cavalry Division had no interest in PSYOP support, so Military Assistance Command
  Vietnam (MACV) ordered the detachment moved in November 1965 to Nha Trang as part of the
  II Corps Operations section (G3). The detachment participated directly in attack planning
  which included control of civilians caught in the battlefield field of fire. On one major
  campaign called &quot;Operation Eagle Claw&quot; in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bong</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Son</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, the 24th POD
  helped to relocate 5,000 refugees onto a temporary site and supply them with tents and
  food for over a month. They supported operations in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bong</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Son</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> on at least three
  separate occasions and dropped millions of leaflets each time. The detachment had
  loudspeaker teams in the field with Vietnamese linguists to call upon the North Vietnamese
  Army and Viet Cong units to surrender. They had one truck with a printing press and
  produced a limited number of propaganda leaflets, but the majority of leaflets were
  printed and flown in from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Some members were assigned to Korean military units,
  other to the 101st Airborne Division. The USAF 5th Air Commando Squadron was formed to
  support the unit. In February 1966, the 24th was re-designated the 245th PSYOP Company and
  became responsible for PSYOP in II Corps.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">The 25th PSYOP Detachment was Commanded by CPT William R. Perry and made
  up of seven officers and 15 enlisted men. In 1965 it was deployed to Southeast Asia from <st1:City w:st="on">San

  Gaffney docked at Qui Nhon in September of 1965. The unit was immediately trucked to an
  air strip where they were flown to Pleiku by C-123 and headquartered in an old French
  compound at the II Corps MACV headquarters north of Pleiku while a permanent barracks was
  built for them. The unit&#146;s primary mission was to support the&nbsp;American and South
  Vietnamese troops in the II corps&nbsp;geographical area with PSYOP capabilities to
  include leaflet production, Medical Civic Action Program (MEDCAP) field trips, movies and
  operations in friendly Montagnard villages. Members of the unit were with the 1st Cavalry
  in November 1965 at the battle of Ia Drang.</p>

  <p>The front depicts U.S. aircraft which appear to be Navy FJ-4F Fury fighter-bombers
  attacking the Viet Cong both day and night. The Fury was an extensively modified ground
  attack version of the F-86 that the Navy put into service after the Korean War as a light
  attack aircraft operating from aircraft carriers. It was flown by Marine pilots and saw
  limited service in Vietnam and parts of Laos. It was replaced in Navy service by the A-4
  Skyhawk attack bomber, which saw extensive service throughout the Vietnam War. The leaflet
  text is:</p>
  <p align="center"><i>During the day you are not safe</i></p>
  <p align="center"><i>At night you are even more terrified</i></p>
  <p>The back is all text:</p>

  <p align="left">First Lieutenant Bob Harvey of the 25th PSYOP Detachment (later Detachment
  B of the 245th PSYOP Company) reminisces about his <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> duty from September 1965 to
  September 1966:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Captain Perry was a good Commanding Officer of the Pleiku Detachment for the period
    he was with us, about September 1965 to June 1966. We all had a lot of respect and
    admiration for him. &nbsp; He was part Apache Indian and part German.&nbsp;He was a real
    Regular Army trooper, an infantry officer with a Combat Infantry Badge. The PSYOP command
    was not for him.&nbsp;He petitioned to get out in the bush and engage the enemy.&nbsp;He
    finally got transferred down south to a combat unit and was replaced by Captain Henry
    (Lee) Dunn, a nice guy from <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Wyoming</st1:place></st1:State> who was the Commander from about July 1966.</i></p>
    <p><i>The introduction of the 25th PSYOP Detachment into the Central Highlands of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>
    at Pleiku in&nbsp;September 1965 coincided with the&nbsp;buildup of 1st Cavalry
    (Airmobile)&nbsp;at An Khe just to the East.&nbsp; The mission of the detachment was to
    collect intelligence regarding enemy weaknesses and vulnerabilities, develop themes and
    materials to exploit these vulnerabilities, and disseminate appeals and messages via
    leaflet, loudspeaker and other means.&nbsp; The detachment had highly trained PSYOP
    officers and enlisted men who had specific expertise in psychological operations, counter
    insurgency, media development, graphic design, leaflet production, audio production,
    photography, and other selected skills. <br>
    <br>
    The specific missions planned and executed by the unit included imbedded field teams to
    collect information relative to enemy vulnerabilities and develop and disseminate
    propaganda to their soldiers.&nbsp; Aerial loudspeaker and leaflet missions flown in U-10,
    C-47 and UH-1 aircraft were conducted throughout the major campaigns, and leaflet missions
    over the tri-country border area (infiltration trails) were commonplace. <br>
    <br>
    The first major ground operation was a field team comprised of one PSYOP Officer and two
    support&nbsp; specialists from the 25th Detachment, and one Vietnamese interpreter. &nbsp;
    This team was attached to the 1st Cavalry during the Ia Drang campaign (November 1965) and
    was able to ascertain NVA vulnerabilities as the basis for PSYOP efforts in the II Corps
    border area&nbsp;throughout the remainder of 1965. <o:p></i></p>
    <p><i>With the introduction of elements of the 25th and 4th Infantry Divisions into the
    Central Highlands in 1966, the Detachment (now redesignated 245th PSYOP Company
    &#147;Detachment B&#148;) participated in numerous campaigns and sweeps of known enemy
    locations for the purpose of&nbsp;exploiting troop weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Many of
    these brigade size campaigns were staged out of the large open fields in and around
    Pleiku, with New Pleiku Airbase (USAF), Camp Hollaway (US ARMY AIR), and the MACV II Corps
    Headquarters providing support.&nbsp; The Detachment&#146;s production facility, located
    at the MACV compound, was able to react quickly to the latest intelligence, and
    develop/produce PSYOP media and material in support of field operations. <br>
    <br>
    Generally, the detachment developed and produced much of its own material, however, major
    leaflet drops (most along the Cambodian border) of thousands of pounds of leaflets by C-47
    required leaflets to be produced at Battalion in Saigon or in Manila.&nbsp; These were
    shipped to New Pleiku&nbsp;Airbase by transport for loading into the C-47 following its
    arrival from its base in Nha Trang.</i></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Second Lieutenant Winston Groom talks about his activities during the
  early days of the Vietnam War with the 245th PSYOP Company:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>I brought over a detachment of about 30 men out of the Psywar Company at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Ft.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bragg</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
    in mid-June, 1966. We boarded the U.S.S. Gaffney for the long trip over. Upon arrival, I
    went several weeks without a specific assignment while I studied the local operations, but
    nobody in command seemed to know exactly what we were supposed to do. </p>
    <p>One morning I was suddenly told to get my stuff together because they had a job for me.
    When I got to headquarters Major Piragowski told me I was to be the PSYOP team leader
    attached to the 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. While I awaited the arrival of my
    assigned unit, I worked with the PSYOP team leader of the 101st Airborne Division brigade,
    which was still operational in the area. I went on missions a few times with the 101st. At
    this stage of the war we were hampered by bad equipment, including loudspeakers, which
    were WWII vintage and rarely worked. It took a one man to carry the speaker that weighed
    about 40+ pounds, and another to carry the batteries, which weighed about as much. </i></p>
    <p><i>Once the 4th Infantry Division went operational, their 1st Brigade, the one I was
    attached to, was assigned to Tuy Hoa. The Brigade Commander Colonel Austin told me,
    &#147;Well, son, whatever you do, get on with it, and we'll give you all the help you
    need, but just don't get in the way of our operations.&#148; The Division let us use their
    chopper and U-10 light aircraft. I took part in some U-10 operations and threw
    out&nbsp;thousands of leaflets that were ordered from <st1:place w:st="on">Saigon</st1:place> or Nha Trang. I had no idea
    what they said, because they were in Vietnamese, but was told that they were as good as
    anything to throw out of the plane, and that the natives in the villages liked them
    because they could use them for toilet paper.</i></p>
    <p><i>During the day all the native villages and hamlets ran up a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Republic</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> flag
    and soon as night fell they took them down and ran up the Viet Cong flag. This so incensed
    Major Jack Lugee, a Forward Artillery Controller one early morning as he flew over a
    village that he swooped down and not only buzzed the village but came away with the Viet
    Cong flag wrapped around his landing gear.</i></p>
    <p><i>The 245th PSYOP Company in Nha Trang continued to ship me tons of leaflets and Chieu
    Hoi safe conduct passes that I dropped out of the U-10 at selected coordinates based on
    where intelligence said there was Viet Cong activity, which for all practical purposes
    included the entire province. We probably could have done some good with the bullhorn if
    any of the battalions had been able to hold contact with the enemy long enough for us to
    get there. The PSYOP Team was simply too small to go out with the rifle battalions on a
    regular basis, and besides we had only one bullhorn that worked sporadically, no matter
    how many times a day I had it tested and worked on. </p>
    <p>We did manage to get some airborne missions using loudspeaker broadcasts of tapes we
    had made, either with the U-10 or by requesting a C-47 out of Nha Trang. Another problem
    was that it was nearly impossible to interrogate prisoners to find out if any of our
    propaganda was working. I asked on a number of occasions if I could at least submit
    questions for them to ask the prisoners, but I never got a straight answer. We were
    working in the dark.</i></p>
    <p><i>I next was attached to Military Assistance Command <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> (MACV) on the southern
    edge of Tuy Hoa. I was provided with a PSYOP truck that had loudspeakers, photo equipment,
    and a big PSYOP logo painted on the side. I did some election work, my interpreter asking
    the local people to get out and vote over the loudspeaker. </i></p>

    about six kilometers from Tuy Hoa. I rode out to the site of the battle and photographed
    about 60 bodies. Shortly after that I flew back to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San Francisco</st1:place></st1:City> and resumed my civilian
    life.</i></p>
    <p><i>It is my considered opinion that the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> Army did not care at all about PSYOP at
    that time. If it had, it would have emphasized comprehensive training and positioned
    competent intelligence officers in the slots, and they would have kept at least some kind
    of tabs on what was going on; provided advice, help, and decent equipment.</i></p>

    <p><b><i>We supported the 1st Cavalry and the 4th Infantry Division with our leaflets. I
    never kept track of where we went and what we did but I know we did a lot of missions that
    had us flying over Laos and Cambodia. I know we went as far south Ban Me Thout, North to
    Kontum, even once to Dalat to support III Corp, and once north to Da Nang. We didn't do
    many loudspeaker missions from the air while I was there, and most of those were done with
    just Air Force personnel. We went up if there were leaflets to drop. I remember unloading
    an entire deuce-and-a-half of leaflets into C47's. <o:p></o:p></i></p>
    <p><i>I flew with one Air Force Major and logged more flight time than anyone else in the
    unit. One day I asked why I was the only one getting requested to crew the U10's and later
    O2B's. He said it was because I could carry on an intelligent conversation and didn't
    throw up, and that second one was the most important attribute a PSYOP soldier could have.</i></p>
    <p><i>We had a great outfit. During my tour I never heard a shot fired in anger. Of
    course, Charlie mortared our perimeter twice, but it was good duty until about mid-1967
    when things got more &quot;stract&quot; and we were no longer allowed to be a bunch of
    &quot;misfits&quot; that did things our own way most of the time. I think we missed that
    freedom. It seems we never had the same morale or espirit de Corps after we got
    &quot;militarized&quot;. </i></p>

  <p align="left">The small early PSYOP detachment was followed by the 6th PSYOP Battalion,
  a command-and-control unit under USARV Special Troops, which arrived in Vietnam from Fort
  Bragg on 7 February 1966. During its independent existence (until 1 December 1967) the 6th
  PSYOP Battalion was the US Army's primary support unit for PSYOP in Vietnam. Headquarters
  was initially in the Kinh Do Theater in Saigon except for the radio and TV advisors, and
  the printing facilities, although a lot of paper and printing supplies were stored on the
  first floor where the seats had been. After the theater was blown up by an estimated 50
  kilograms of &#147;plastique,&#148; (Staff Sergeant Ron Baker told me that he believed it
  was a satchel charge that blew the roof off the building he called the Capitol Theater),
  it moved some distance away to a small, modern, three-story building near Cholon that had
  been an auto shop. Our next location was down by the bridge, a small Japanese warehouse
  compound. That remained the HQ location until they moved downtown to the railway area. In
  the fall of 1967, the battalion headquarters moved to the Saigon Railyards, now referred
  to as the Cruz Compound. The 6th PSYOP Bn operated independent of the Saigon-based Vietnam
  Detachment of the 7th PSYOP Group. &nbsp; The 7th Group was represented at the Japanese
  warehouse; they had a small liaison party there, two enlisted men and one officer. At this
  time the printing plant was located on the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Binh</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Loi</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Canal</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, about a block away from the
  last bridge before the long ride to Bien Hoa. The unit was located in the compound of the
  ARVN 50th POLWAR Battalion, which turned out to be built on top of an old French
  ammunition dump. The dump was discovered about June 1967, when excavating for the concrete
  pad and building to house the new 3G press. The site was moved once the dump was
  discovered.</p>
  <p><b>The crest of the 6th Battalion depicted above is very interesting because the sword
  in the center has flames coming from the hilt that are grey, white and black. These colors
  stand for the three types of information that can be transmitted; white propaganda that
  had the origin clearly labeled; gray propaganda is information that bears no
  identification and could be from friendly or enemy sources; and black propaganda is
  information put out by an opposing government or institution and made to look as though it
  came from a friendly source. It is sometimes called &#147;dirty tricks.&#148;</p>
  <p>The unit received Meritorious Unit Commendations for Vietnam 1966-1967 and Vietnam
  1967-1968.</p>

  <p>Specialist 4 Eugene Simmons was an illustrator in the 246th PSYOP Company (Professional
  Litterbugs) for all of 1967. He recalls that Viet Cong prisoners of war would sometimes be
  isolated, interviewed and photographed. They would be asked to write a note to their
  combat buddies letting them know they were at alive and healthy.&nbsp;Photos would be
  taken and a leaflet produced with a photo of the prisoner on one side and his handwritten
  or typed note on the other side.&nbsp;Leaflet 246-55-67 depicts Nguyen Van Tuong. 50,000
  leaflets were printed to be dropped by air over the 315B Unit at the request of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
  1st Infantry Division. The text on the back says in part:</p>
  <blockquote>

    ago we were living together but I did not know where my honor was. I saw only the deaths

  <p align="center">SP4 John D. (Dave) Boyers was a member of the 4th PSYOP Group from
  January to November 1968. He recalls his service:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>I arrived in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Republic</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> the day before the 1968 Tet offensive began. We
    were told that we were in a highly secure area and that not a shot had been fired for
    weeks there. That night, what we thought were celebratory fireworks kept getting louder,
    until we realize it wasn't fireworks at all.</i></p>
    <p><i>I was involved in setting up the first photo processing laboratory at 4th Group
    Headquarters in <st1:place w:st="on">Saigon. The lab was in the last&nbsp;Quonset hut at the left end of the
    row in the Cruz Compound. It contained a darkroom, an art department which consisted of
    some layout tables and a varityper, and a small audio recording studio. </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">[Note: The Varityper was a highly ingenious word processor of the
  pre-digital age. This machine could use over 300 different type styles and write in 55
  languages. It produced neat, camera-ready copy for offset printing, at a cost much lower
  than that of conventional printer's methods. The machine used by the 4th Group was an
  early model that did not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar, and did no text
  formatting without complicated extra work on the user's part. It was a typesetting device
  which was capable of full justification. It still required that diacritical marks be
  inserted into the finished document by hand, a long and difficult task].</p>
  <p align="left">[Note 2: Another 4th Group member tells of building the PSYOP complex:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>It was at the old train yards in what's now called the Cruz Compound.&nbsp; We moved
    there in late summer of 1967. We had been located at the 50th ARVN PSYOP compound on the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Binh</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">    Loi</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Canal</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, the last bridge before heading up the road to Bien Hoa.&nbsp; We were ordered
    out of that location when our Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams discovered we were
    running our presses on top of what used to be an old French ammunition dump. Years of
    monsoons had washed the covering soil away and all kinds of ordnance, exploded and
    non-exploded started peeking up through the ground. We therefore packed up and moved our
    operation to <st1:place w:st="on">Saigon</st1:place>]. <o:p></o:p> </i></p>

    main entrance had a guard post which was manned by an MP. The rest of the compound had
    four or five posts, one at each end and a couple along the railroad tracks. These posts
    were manned by our enlisted personnel.</i><o:p></o:p></p>
    <p><i>Prior to&nbsp;building the photo lab,&nbsp;we took our film to the Air Force
    Photograph Shop at the airport for processing, and it was a long and sometimes dangerous
    drive. Once we could process our own film and prints, we started producing some tactical
    leaflets. We formed what we called a quick response team, made up of an officer, a
    photographer and an interpreter. I don&#146;t recall all the details, but I do remember
    going to shoot photographs of captured and surrendered Viet Cong after several battles in

    <p><i>About 14 May 1968, the warehouse where the printing paper and chemicals were stored
    was hit by a Viet Cong rocket. I seem to recall that it was close to Ho Chi Minh&#146;s
    birthday on 19 May and I guess the Viet Cong wanted to help him celebrate. A number of
    small huts behind the stores that faced the warehouse were set on fire. No one at the unit
    was hurt, though the guard bunker on top the fuel tank was actually only about 50 feet
    from the impact point of the rocket that hit the warehouse.</i></p>
    <p><i>The photographic darkroom was right next door to the warehouse. Shrapnel from the
    attack went through two interior walls of the Quonset hut and through the steel drum of
    our brand new Pako print dryer. The darkroom was then moved a few buildings away and
    rebuilt about three times bigger. We were able to develop and print black and white film.
    We had no use for color at the time because almost all our leaflets were printed in black
    and white. Some leaflets had color added, but we never used a four-color process at that
    time.</i></p>
    <p><i>We also produced a magazine for Vietnamese civilians but I don&#146;t recall any of
    the details of how it was distributed, or any reactions to it.</i><o:p></o:p></p>
    <p><i>Another&nbsp;effort we took part in&nbsp;was a small, fixed-frequency AM radio
    receiver which was air dropped. I wrote and photographed a brochure that went with the
    radio, explaining how to turn it on and listen, and to not be afraid to open the package.
    The radio sample I used was made of brown plastic, has an earphone for a speaker, about
    the size of a pack of cigarettes, with the inside filled with a black tar so it could not
    be used for any other purpose than to listen to our PSYOP broadcasts.</i></p>
    <p><i>We also wrote a handbook on how to use the PSYOP loudspeaker. &nbsp;Several of us in
    PDC had had commercial broadcasting experience before our service, and we built a small
    recording studio where we interviewed subjects to make loudspeaker tapes. I made
    transcripts of some of those interviews which featured the unbelievable hardships the Viet
    Cong and North Vietnamese Army faced. </i></p>

  rocket attack must have been a late evening on a weekend because he worked nights printing
  leaflets during the week. He was in the hotel and the men were not allowed out of the
  hotel after 10:00 p.m. so the rocket attack would have come later when he was locked down.
  He heard the explosion and looked out the back window to see the street covered in flames.
  The American soldiers immediately went downstairs to the shelter in case there were
  further attacks. The next day he went to see the damage and all the close-packed houses
  built of wood were destroyed and there were charred bodies everywhere. He still carries

    <p><i>The radios would be packed in plastic cases with a spare battery, giving them 20
    hours playing time. They would be dropped by tiny parachutes and fixed at a pre-set
    frequency which would pick up the Voice of <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region> or the Vietnamese government&#146;s

  radios on many occasions. Some of the MACVSOG reports of the discoveries are as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>On 2 May 1965, fisherman found large and small boxes floating in the water. The
    small boxes contained children&#146;s clothing and handkerchiefs. The large boxes were
    sealed with green tape and wrapped in a nylon bag. When opening the eight large boxes they
    found radios, about 25cm long and 10cm high. The listeners noted that the radios played
    Vietnamese music and talk stations. Within every box was a piece of paper that said,
    &#147;This radio set is donated to the people of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Do not allow anyone to
    take it from you. Keep it to follow the situation.&#148; Security forces found out and two
    days later confiscated 23 radio sets within the Tuong Lai commune. </i></p>
    <p><i>During the night of 9 July 1965, rangers using rubber boats landed on the coast.
    They advanced 3 kilometers into the mainland near Yen Diem and laid 25 radio sets there,
    one of which was turned on. </i></p>

  propaganda gift boxes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>About Tet 1965 on three occasions gift boxes were found drifting in transparent
    plastic boxes near Liem Lap hamlet. They contained children&#146;s clothes, handkerchiefs,
    lighters, pencils, pen and pen holders, and fishing lines and hooks. Security agents
    confiscated the boxes saying that if they were brought home they would explode. In
    addition, if the finders wore the clothes after 3 months and 10 days their skin be swollen
    and they would die from poison that the enemy soaked into the cloth.</i></p>

    field research in conjunction with psychological studies in a counterinsurgency
    environment. I reviewed and prepared reports on enemy propaganda directed against US
    Forces. </i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>I had assigned to my section approximately 15 soldiers, eight of which had

    required. </i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>We constantly reviewed incoming intelligence reports and situation reports. Let's
    say, we discovered that captured enemy soldiers had malaria. We would quickly develop the
    narrative message we wanted to portray on leaflets (mention their conditions and offer
    immediate medical assistance), and prepare broadcast tape(s) if applicable. We would then
    have the narrative theme interpreted and cross checked twice by American and Vietnamese
    soldiers or civilians. In the meantime, our Art and Design Section of the Product
    Development Center would have been alerted and would be designing the art work for the

  successes in the declassified <i>Senior Officer Debriefing Report. </i>He notes that one
  of the major problems during the war was that the Vietnamese people did not identify with
  the Government of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> and vice versa. He says that there are few national symbols like

  &#147;The Impact of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region> of Strategic Thinking in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,&#148; who says
  that it takes more than just words to produce worthwhile propaganda. Deeds are just as
  important. He gives an example that hopefully is exaggerated:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>The Agency for International development would come to a village in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
    help it out&#133;the next day the air force would bomb the village. Then a Special Forces
    team would go in to work with the survivors and rebuild the village and train them in self
    defense. Next the artillery would barrage the village. Then a psychological operations
    unit would pass around leaflets and explain the importance of fighting the Viet Cong. Then
    the navy would flatten the place with its gunfire.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Beck points out that the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> treat PSYOP in a completely
  different way. The Vietnamese try to propagandize in the Chinese manner, winning the
  loyalty of their followers, the beaurocracy and the armed forces; while the masses and
  ethnic minorities are secondary considerations. The Americans, on the other hand, want the
  hearts and minds of the masses if success is to be achieved.</p>
  <p align="left">He notes that the ARVN Political Warfare Battalions are not well trained
  and it would take at least one year to bring them up to the level of a <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">US</st1:place></st1:country-region> PSYOP battalion.
  He complains that there is some frustration at the lack of signs of tangible success, and
  this has led to gimmicks like the ace of spades calling card, sky-lighting effects, and
  ghostly loudspeakers. He says that this has reduced idea formation to the level of
  gimmicky and desperate attempts to find a quick solution and dramatic breakthrough. He
  concludes, &#147;This is not good PSYOP.&#148; The Colonel ends with a warning that the
  Vietnamese must be trained to take over PSYOP, but it should be clearly understood that
  they are not presently capable of doing so and need extensive training.</p>
  <p align="left">LTC Beck was replaced by Colonel Taro Katagiri who commanded the 4th PSYOP
  Group from 4 October 1968 to 13 March 1970. He discusses some of his unit&#146;s problems
  and successes in another declassified <i>Senior Officer Debriefing Report. </i>He points
  out that captured enemy documents show that they are most concerned by pacification
  operations within <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Yet, the Colonel found that most members of his organization
  were unfamiliar with the pacification program. He had to redirect his personnel to support
  the campaign. He pointed out that the enemy regularly attacked the government&#146;s
  ability to protect people, so PSYOP should build up the image of government agencies and
  encourage people to report information on the enemy. He also thought it important to
  produce propaganda clearly depicting the Viet Cong and PAVN as &#147;Enemies of the
  People.&#148; He notes that the enemy relies on face-to-face grassroots propaganda, but do
  not hesitate to use terrorism in support of their aims. He complains that the South
  Vietnamese government&#146;s propaganda is fragmented with the Ministry of Information on
  the Civilian side and the General Political Warfare Department with its five Political
  Warfare Battalions on the military side. He points out the difference in manning and
  equipment between US and Vietnamese battalions. The American unit is authorized eight
  model 1250 multilith presses and two sheet-fed 17&#148; x 22&#148; presses, compared to
  the Vietnamese who have just two model 1250 multilith presses.</p>
  <p align="left">Katagiri is proud to point out that in 1969, 47,000 of the enemy became
  &#147;Hoi Chanhs.&#148; That is two and one-half times the number of the previous year.
  Fifty-seven people rallied from one village in September and claimed that they had been
  influenced by Chieu Hoi leaflet drops. At the same time, he says that supplies and
  maintenance are inadequate, mostly because the Group uses non-standard, low density
  equipment such as multilith presses, Hess and Barker presses, paper cutters, plate makers,
  AN/UIH-6 public address systems, a 50,000 watt radio station and the like.</p>
  <p align="left">He concludes that there needs to be better method of coordinating and
  unifying the PSYOP message. The army needs senior officers to understand what PSYOP can
  do. He gives an example of a brigade commander who boasted that his Chieu Hoi program
  consisted of two howitzers, one named &#147;Chieu&#148; and the other &#147;Hoi.&#148; He
  tells of pilots not wanting to drop leaflets because &#147;That is mixing politics with
  war.&#148; He wants an appreciation of PSYOP taught to all officers from early in their
  training.</p>

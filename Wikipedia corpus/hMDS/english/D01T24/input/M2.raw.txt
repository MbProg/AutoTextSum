The work : Campbell's Soup Cans
“Campbell’s soup cans”  32 20” x 16” silk-screen oil paintings, each of a different variety (flavor) of Campbell’s soup, first presented in Los Angeles on 9th July 1962 (date considered the beginning of Pop Art) and now on permanent exhibition at the MOMA.
The list of soups  by Campbell’s and  the order of introduction of each flavor onto the market.
Manufacturing process: semi-mechanical (stencil) silk-screen painting, with dominant white and red colours and a touch of gold. The work  realist rather than abstract.
Public reaction: people  by the complete change from abstract expressionism and the interest in popular culture. But there  apparently no message: what  Warhol mean to say?
Interpretation: 
a) The work  a declaration of love for popular culture, and the idea that art  for everybody, not just for the elite. 
b) Art and advertising: Warhol  advertising is a form of art and that ads can be used as a source of inspiration. The large number of cans  the excess and the uniformity of modern consumption.
c) A work of art in touch with the present: it  the spirit of 60s America in its simplicity and in the way it  a very material world. 
d) Many  Warhol  capitalism with its emphasis on consumption, on uniformity (making mass production cheaper and more profitable) , and its rejection of the old and love of the new.
Conclusion: Warhol  everybody  a right to ¼ of an hour of fame. Perhaps all his art  this. Art  for everybody just as fame can be for everybody. It  certain that he  famous because of pop art and he  today one of the most important and popular artists.

But he does definitely deserve some flack for his f-up of a job on the One Love print I gotta say!
Other than that one - gotta love him.

Having missed getting a One Love print to all the flippers, I secretly have enjoyed all the grief the bad print jobs has caused.
I guess it's not a secret anymore.

I still think it's funny how everyone gets their panties in a bunch over Mr. Brainwash.
Why even pay attention to someone or art you don't like?
I think some people may have a problem with the fact that there are so many artists with extreme talent that don't get that much fame, and it may say something scary about the art world and the direction it's going if a guy like MBW is selling paintings for up to $300,000 when he's only been producing art for 2-3 years.
It's worth paying attention to because there's a level of significance to how people are responding to his whole thing, and it's hard to know if it'll just fizzle out, or keep going.
I think a lot of people like to compare him to Warhol, but that just shows a person's lack of knowledge when they do that.
It's a totally different situation, and he's also not the first at doing anything.
It's all well made stuff, but it lacks the soul that a lot of other art has, and the big question is whether or not enough people will wise up to that, or if the standards of art are going to sh*t.
He's also pretty much set on sticking to the street art thing, which is dying out.
Even former/transitioning street artists say so, and the smart ones are finding new directions.
If MBW doesn't transition, he'll probably be left in the dust.

on one level i agree, but to the extent that they both had/have minions doing the actual production, it seems a pretty fair comparison.
put kostabi in that mix as well.
the fact is warhol was much more of a true artist in terms of creating visuals rather than simply conceptualizing them.

My problem with the Warhol/Brainwash comparison is that Warhol needed a studio because he was making so much stuff.
I believe that if he'd had the time he could have personally made everything that came out of there.
Guetta is apparently without artistic talent, I don't think there's ever been a "MBW" image for which he's personally responsible.
Warhol was an artist with subcontractors, MBW is a financier.

I totally agree with your points.
I do know for a fact that Thierry does the pieces like this mostly by himself:
That's really it though.
The others are pretty much all produced by other people and Thierry wouldn't be able to make them look half as good.

The art world has always been that way.
I can find half a dozen people on the Venice boardwalk whose art looks better than Richard Prince's.
Yet his nurse paintings are fetching eight figures.
The art world has always been about hype, who the artist hangs out with, who's buying the work and who's talking about it.
Take Basquiat for example.
Some would argue that Basquiat's work is garbage, while others say it's genius.
The only difference being those who say it's genius have millions in disposable income.
One can argue that Warhol was attracted to Basquiat and took him under his wing for that reason only, creating a "master painter" out of a graffiti artist named "SAMO".
You can almost put a time stamp on when exactly Basquiat's work turned from "wtf is that" to "it's a masterpiece", even though his style didn't change.
He used to walk around New York, trying to sell his paintings for a few hundred dollars so he could eat, to no avail.
IMHO if Basquiat didn't hang out with Warhol, he wouldn't have been in any art history books or museums.
Same goes for Haring, again in my humble opinion.
Their work is far from genius, fresh and new sure, but nothing that anyone with a half ass talent for drawing couldn't do.
Not taking anything away from Basquiat and Haring's accomplishments, just stating my opinion that in the art world, more often than not, success and infamy are not measured by the quality of the work.

While hanging out with the right people helps, Basquiat and Haring did so well because they died.
Kenny Scharf hung out with the same people, but he isn't half as famous.
Basquiat was also about to be totally given up on because of his heroine problem, and died at the perfect time.
I love the saying "death is the ultimate career move in an artist's life".
If Thierry died I'm sure his art would do fine.

Totally agree with you, bud.
Mbw knows exactly what he's doing.
He's a marketing genius.
From doing Madonna's album cover, to affiliating himself with celebrities and producers, it goes on and on.
Not sure if he majored in marketing, but he sure as hell has a knack for making the right moves.
How else can an artist who is clowned more than praised sell pieces for so much money?
Like I said in my previous post, the ones who are saying his work is genius are the ones who have the income to make it seem that way.

I really do think that there are a lot of similarities between Warhol and MBW in some ways.
For example, look at all of the controversy that the original soup can canvases stirred up when they were shown at the Ferus Gallery in L.A.
An awful lot of people were insulted and offended that they should be expected to accept the work as being "art".
Only 6 out of the original 32 canvases sold over a course of about three weeks for $100 each (Dennis Hopper bought the first one) and after this Andy Blum, the gallery owner, had the foresight to understand the importance of keeping the entire grouping together as a complete suite and approached the 6 individuals who had each bought one and convinced them to sell them back to him and he then worked out a deal with Andy to buy the complete suite of 32 canvases for $1000 which he was allowed to pay over the course of a year.
Now they are priceless.
I am not saying that MBW is Warhol but there are many aspects of what MBW is doing that remind me Warhol's path...
Getting ideas from other people...
Ted Carey:
"I said, 'John, Muriel [Latow] and I are having dinner tonight.
Do you want to have dinner with us?'
And he [Andy Warhol] said, 'No, I'm just too depressed.'
So, I said, 'Maybe we'll come by afterwards.'
... So after dinner we went to Andy's, and he was very depressed... Andy said I've got to do something.'
He said, 'the cartoon paintings... it's too late.
I've got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing.'
And he said, 'I don't know what to do.'
So, he said, 'Muriel, you've got fabulous ideas.
Can't you give me an idea?'
And, so, Muriel said... 'you've got to find something that's recognizable to almost everybody.
Something you see every day that everybody would recognize.
Something like a can of Campbell's Soup.'
So Andy said, 'oh that sounds fabulous.'
So, the next day Andy went out to the supermarket - because we went by the next day - and we came in, and he had a case of... all the soups..."
Annoying other artists...
Irving Blum:
"The artists, who were very hostile... were provoked by these paintings... It was very peculiar.
There was a lot of amusement.
People felt that they were somehow slightly ridiculous.
A gallery dealer up the road, I remember, did something that was very well publicized at the time.
He bought dozens and dozens and dozens of cans of Campbell Soup cans at the supermarket, put them in his window, and said, 'Buy them cheaper here - 60 cents for three cans.'
Or something like that.
And so, there was a lot of hilarity regarding them.
Not a great deal of serious interest... in fact, hardly any serious speculation.
But a lot of carnival-like activity regarding the exhibition."
"In addition to "hilarity," the paintings provoked both intellectual and emotional responses from viewers."
I find it all very fascinating.

Warhol was doing something new though.
I don't see anything new about Thierry's work.
Artist's have been ripping off other artists for a long time.
Not new.
Thierry uses popular images.
Not new.
He's got lots of similarities with other artists, but that's pretty much just because he's borrowing or stealing ideas.
Comparing him to Warhol and giving him a similar credit is kinda silly.
I think all one should say is that he's attempting similar concepts, but in no way is it revolutionary.

I honestly don't think that is his mission.
He's just one of the MANY players on the field.

My reference was Mr Andy Warhol and his 32 Campbell's Soup Cans work, produced in 1962. Those individual paintings were made by a printmaking method — the semi-mechanized screen printing process, using a non-painterly style.
The combination of these processes and the commercial subject initially caused a great deal of debate about the merits and ethics of such work, but later they helped transform Warhol from being an accomplished 1950s commercial illustrator to a notable fine artist.
I decided to reverse the process. I took a big hammer and several Campbell's Soup Cans.
Those unique works were made by a impression method — a total un-controlled process, using a non-painterly-splash style.

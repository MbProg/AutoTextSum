			<p><strong>The Ordinances of 1311</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000bf;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000bf;">The
Ordinances were an attempt by the Barons to both resolve the problems and
differences they had had with Edward I and which had continued into the new
reign, and put an end to the crisis caused by Edward II’s reckless favouritism
towards Piers Gaveston.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000bf;">It has
been described as ‘oligarchical’; the phrase ‘community of the realm’ doesn’t
appear, the ordinances stress the role of the baronage in parliament. In fact,
it’s doubtful that the barons had any intention of removing the powers and
rights of knights and towns; more that they were simply not present at the
parliament where the barons forced acceptance on Edward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000bf;">The
ordinances have a number of groups of issues they try to address: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000bf;">Exactions of the king – the vexed
     questions of impositions such as prise and purveyance</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000bf;">Control of royal officials – such as
     forest officials, household officers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000bf;">Legal reform – such as trying to stop
     malicious accusations</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000bf;">Specific individuals – the ‘evil
     counsellors’ the barons didn’t like</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&#0160;<span style="color: #0000bf; font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">In the
end, the ordinances started a period of conflict – between Thomas, Earl of
Lancaster and his supporters, and the king, rather than bringing one to an end.
But despite the fact that there are few innovations in the Ordinances, most
clauses hark back to the Articles on the Charters of Edward I’s reign, there
are significant changes. Never before had the king been required to answer to
parliament so comprehensively – such as appointing his officials, or leaving
the country, or changing the currency.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf; font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">The
version of the ordinances below is not complete –omissions are marked through
lacunae and numbering.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 11pt; color: #111111;">Whereas, through bad and deceitful counsel,
our lord the king and all his men have everywhere been dishonoured and his
crown in many ways has been debased and ruined, while his lands of Gascony,
Ireland, and Scotland are on the point of being lost unless God improves the
situation, and his realm of England has been brought to the verge of rebellion
through prises and [other] oppressive and destructive measures—which facts are
known and proved—our lord the king of his free will has granted to the
prelates, earls, and barons, and to the other good men of his realm, that certain
persons should be elected to ordain and determine the condition of his household
and of his realm, as appears more fully in the commission issued by our lord
the king in this connection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000bf;">The 21 Ordainers were a mix of churchmen and barons, as in the
table below. Edward did his best to get men on the group who were moderate on
his side – but had little success. Edward fought as hard as he knew how to stop
the Ordinances going forward – but in 1311 he and Gaveston were pretty much on
their own. </span></p>

<p>Therefore we, Robert, by the grace of God
archbishop of Canterbury and primate of all England, and the bishops, earls,
and barons elected by virtue of the said commission, do ordain for the honour
of God and Holy Church and of the king and his realm in the manner following:—</p>
<p>1. In the first place it is ordained that
     Holy Church shall have all its liberties as heretofore and as it should
     have them.</p>
<p>2. Item, it is ordained that the king&#39;s
     peace shall be firmly kept throughout the entire kingdom; so that everyone
     may safely go, come, and remain according to the law and custom of the
     realm.</p>
<p><br />3. Item, it is ordained that, in order to
     acquit the king&#39;s debts, to relieve his estate, and the more honourably to
     maintain it, no gift of land, rent, liberty, escheat, wardship, marriage,
     or office shall be made to any of the said Ordainers during their [tenure
     of] power under the said ordinance, or to any other person, without the
     counsel and assent of the said Ordainers or the majority of them—or of six
     of them at least—but that all sources of profit shall be improved for the
     benefit of the king until his estate is properly relieved and some other
     ordinance may be made for the honour and profit of the king.</p>
<p><br />4. Item, it is ordained that the customs of
     the kingdom shall be received and kept by men of the kingdom itself, and
     not by aliens ; and that the issues and profits of the same customs,
     together with all other issues and profits pertaining to the kingdom from
     any source whatsoever, shall in their entirety come to the king&#39;s
     exchequer and be paid by the treasurer and the chamberlain for maintaining
     the king&#39;s household and [to be spent] in other ways for his benefit ; so
     that the king may live of his own without taking prises other than those
     anciently due and accustomed. And all others shall cease.</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000bf;">An interesting clause. Firstly the echoes of the disputes of Henry
IIIrd’s reign still rumble on – Gaveston himself was a Gascon. Secondly, under
Edward I the kings wardrobe had become more and more central to the royal
finances, bypassing the exchequer. As far as the barons were concerned, this
gave the king far too much freedom of action. So here they are saying this must
stop – everything goes through the Exchequer, so parliament can control and
check it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000bf;">And finally the phrase ‘live of his own’ is mighty interesting; it
will take a remarkably long time for your average baron to accept that taxation
is now part of the weft and warp of government finances; the days of William
the Conqueror, where the king owned half the country and could govern without
financial assistance were gone for ever.</span></p>
<p>6. Item; it is ordained- that the Great
     Charter shall be observed in all its particulars ; so that, if there is
     any point in the said charter that is doubtful or obscure, it shall be
     interpreted by the said Ordainers and other men whom they may see fit to
     call upon for that purpose….</p>
7. And besides, since the crown has been so
     abased and ruined by numerous grants, we ordain that all grants made to
     the damage of the king and the impoverishment of the crown since the
     commission was given to us . . . shall be annulled; and we do annul them
     entirely, so that they shall not be given back to the same persons without
     the common assent [of the baronage] in parliament…<br /><ol>
</ol>9. Whereas the king, on account of the many
     perils that he and his kingdom may incur, ought not to undertake an act of
     war against any one, or to go out of the kingdom, without the common
     assent of his baronage, we ordain that henceforth the king shall neither
     go out of the kingdom nor undertake an act of war against any one without
     the common assent of his baronage, and that in parliament. . .&#0160;<br /><ol>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, geneva; color: #0000bf;">So here’s the point about the role of parliament – far broader than
it has been before.</span> </p>
<p>10. And whereas it is feared that the people
     of the land will rebel on account of the prises and divers oppressions
     recently established…we ordain that henceforth all prises shall be
     abolished except the ancient and lawful prises due to the king and to
     others who are lawfully entitled to them. And if any prises are taken
     contrary to the ordinance aforesaid by any one whomsoever, no matter of
     what condition he may be—that is to say, if any one, under colour of
     purveyance for the use of our lord the king or of someone else, takes
     grain, wares, merchandise, or other goods against the will of those to
     whom they belong, and does not immediately .give in return money to the
     true value [of the goods], unless he thereof has respite by the free will
     of the seller according to the provision in the Great Charter regarding
     prises taken by constables of castles and their bailiffs, saving the
     accustomed prises aforesaid—notwithstanding any commission that may be
     [issued], pursuit with hue and cry shall be raised against him and he
     shall be taken to the nearest jail of the king, and the common law shall
     be enforced against him as against a robber or thief, should he be
     convicted of sail [wrong-doing].</p>
<p>11. Also, [whereas] new customs have been
     levied and the old [customs] have been increased upon wool, cloth, wines,
     avoirdupois, and other things—whereby [our] merchants come more rarely and
     bring fewer goods into the country, while alien merchants reside longer
     than they used to, and by such residence things become dearer than they
     used to be, to the damage of the king and his people—we ordain that all
     manner of customs and maltotes levied since the coronation of King Edward,
     son of King Henry, are to be entirely removed and utterly abolished
     forever, notwithstanding the charter which the said King Edward granted to
     alien merchants because –it was issued contrary to the Great Charter and
     contrary to the liberty of the city of London and without the assent of
     the baronage. . . .</p>
<p>13&#0160; And
whereas the king, as aforesaid, has been badly advised and guided by evil
councillors, we ordain that all the evil councillors shall be put out and utterly
removed, so that neither they nor other such persons shall be near him or shall
be retained in any office under the king; and that other persons who are fit
shall be put in their places. And the same shall be done in the case of
domestics, officials, and other men in the king&#39;s household who are not fit.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf; font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, geneva;">The barons would soon present a further ordinance to the king,
removing a number of specific household officials.</span> </p>
<p>14&#0160; And
whereas many evils have been incurred through [the employment of] such councillors
and such ministers, we ordain that the king shall appoint the chancellor, the
chief justices of both benches, the treasurer, the chancellor and the chief
baron of the exchequer, the steward of the household, the keeper of the
wardrobe, the comptroller and a fit clerk to keep the privy seal, a chief
keeper of the forests on this side of Trent and one on the other side of Trent,
also an escheator on this side of Trent and one on the other side, as well as
the king&#39;s chief clerk of the common bench, by&#0160;
the counsel and assent of the baronage, and that in parliament. And if
by some chance it happens that there is need to appoint any of the said ministers
before parliament meets, then the king shall make such appointments by the good
counsel [of those] whom he shall have near him up to the time of the
parliament. And so let it be done henceforth with regard to such ministers
whenever there is need.</p>
<p>15&#0160; Item,
we ordain that the chief wardens of ports and of castles on the sea shall be
appointed and installed in the aforesaid manner, and that such wardens are to
be of the land itself.</p>
<p>16&#0160; And
whereas the lands of Gascony, Ireland, and Scotland are in peril of being lost
through default of good ministers, we ordain that worthy and fit ministers to
keep ward in the said lands shall be named according—to the form set forth in
the article before the last [preceding]</p>
<p>17&#0160; Moreover,
we ordain that sheriffs shall henceforth be appointed by the chancellor, the
treasurer, and others of the council who are present; and if the chancellor is
not present, let them be appointed by the treasurer, the barons of the
exchequer, and the justices of the bench. And such men are to be named and
installed as are fit and worthy, and as have lands and tenements through which
they may be held responsible for their actions to the king or to the people.
And only such persons shall be appointed, and they shall have their commissions
under the great seal. . . .</p>
<p>20&#0160;&#0160; Because it is known, and by examination by the
prelates, earls and barons, knights and other good people of the kingdom found,
that Piers Gavaston has acted badly towards and has badly advised our lord the
king and has incited him to do wrong in divers and deceptive ways; in taking
possession of for himself all the king&#39;s treasure and sending it out of the
kingdom; in drawing to himself royal power and royal dignity, as in making alliances
on oath with people to live and die with him against all men, and this by the
treasure he acquires from day to day; in lording it over the estate of the king
and of the crown, to the ruin of the king and of the people; and especially in
estranging the heart of the king from his lieges; in despising their counsels,
not allowing good officers to carry out the law of the land; in removing good
officers, appointing those of his own gang, as well aliens as others, who at
his will and command offend against right and the law of the land; in taking
the king&#39;s lands, tenements and bailiwicks to himself and his heirs; and has
Caused the king to give lands and tenements of his crown to divers people to
the great loss and diminution of the estate of the king and of his crown, and
this as well since the ordinance that the king granted to the ordainers to act
for the profit of himself and his people as before against the ordinance of the
ordainers ; and in maintaining robbers and murderers and getting for them the
king&#39;s charter of his peace, in emboldening wrongdoers to do worse, and in
taking the king into a land where there is war without the common assent of his
baronage to the danger of his person and the ruin of the kingdom, and in
causing blank charters under the great seal of the king to be sealed to the
deceit and disinheritance of the king and of his crown, and against his homage;
and feloniously, falsely and traitorously has done the aforesaid things to the
great dishonour and loss of the king and disinheriting of the crown and to the
ruin of his people in many ways: &#0160;And in
addition to this we having regard to what was done by the most noble king, the
father of the present king, by whose adjudgment the aforesaid Piers abjured the
realm of England and whose will it was that our lord the king, his son, should
abjure forever his company, and that since by the common assent of all the
realm and of the king and of the same prelates, earls and barons it was
heretofore adjudged that he should leave the said realm, and he did leave it,
and that his return was never by common assent, but only by the assent of some
individuals who agreed to it on condition of his behaving well after his
return: and now his bad conduct is established beyond doubt, for which conduct
and for the great wickednesses aforementioned and for the many others that could
befall our lord the king and his people, and in order to foster good
understanding between the king and his people and avoid many kinds of discords
and dangers, We ordain, by virtue of the commission our lord the king granted
us, that Piers Gavaston as the evident enemy of the king and of his people be
completely exiled as well from the kingdom of England, Scotland, Ireland and
Wales as from the &#39;whole lordship of our lord the king overseas as well as on
this side, forever without ever returning; and that he leave the kingdom of
England and all the aforesaid lands and absolutely all the lordship of our lord
the king between now and the feast of All Saints next to come; and we assign to
him as port in the way aforesaid Dover and nowhere else for crossing and
leaving. And if the said Piers stays in the kingdom of England or anywhere else
in the lordship of our lord the king beyond the said day that has been given
him for leaving and crossing as is aforesaid, then let there be done with him
as would be done with the enemy of the king and of the kingdom and of his
people. And let all those who from now on contravene this ordinance with regard
to the said exile or the penalty that follows, be dealt with accordingly, if
they are convicted of it.</p>
<p>21&#0160;&#0160;
Also we ordain
that Amerigo and those of the company of Frescobaldi come to the accounting in
the way that was ordained and published, notwithstanding the account they say
they have rendered, within the fortnight after next Michaelmas and in the
meantime let there be arrested all the persons and all the goods of members of
the company of Frescobaldi that can be found in the power of the king of
England, and that all the lands of the said Amerigo be seized into the hand of
the king whereso-ever they are in the said power of the king. And if the said
Amerigo does not come within the day assigned, because the aforesaid ordinance
has been infringed by him and by his non-appearance he renders himself culpable
and suspect we ordain that he be banished from the power of the king and from
now on be deemed an enemy and it be done with him as would be done with an
enemy of the king and of the kingdom, if he be found anywhere in the power of
the king as well overseas as on this side. </p>
<p>22&#0160;&#0160;
Also because sir
Henry de Beaumont has received from our lord the king to the loss ,and
dishonour of the king, since the time of the ordinance of the ordainers to
which the king agreed, the kingdom of Man and other lands, rents, liberties and
bailiwicks and has caused lands and tenements liberties and bailiwicks to be
given to others contrary to this ordinance, and because he has badly advised
the king contrary to his oath, We ordain that he be removed from the king&#39;s
counsel for ever and that he come no more near the king anywhere — unless it be
at the common summons of parliament or in war if the king wishes to have him —
save by common assent of the archbishop, bishops, earls and barons and that in
full parliament; and all the other lands that he holds within the kingdom of
England be taken into the hand of the king of England and held until the king
has received from the issues of these lands the value of all the yield that the
said sir Henry has had from the lands received co4rary to the said ordinance, and
if the said sir Henry in any point contravenes these ordinances let him be
disinherited forever of all the lands that he has in England of the king&#39;s
gift. </p>
Because it is found by
examination by the prelates, earls and barons that the lady de Vescy has caused
the king to give to sir Henry de Beaumont, her brother, and to others, lands,
liberties and bailiwicks to the loss and dishonour of the king and the evident
disinheritance of the crown and also caused to be sent out letters under the
urge&#39; against the law and the intention of the king, We ordain that she go to
her house — and that within the fortnight after next Michaelmas — without ever
returning to the court to stay there, and that for all these aforesaid things
and because it is understood that Bamburgh castle belongs to the crown, we also
ordain that this castle be retaken from her into the hand of the king and that
it be no more given to her or to another except at the king&#39;s pleasure.
<p>24 And
whereas the people feel much aggrieved because of divers debts demanded of them
for the king&#39;s use by summons from the exchequer, of which debts, being
actually paid, the people have various acquittances . . . ; we ordain that
henceforth in the account of every sheriff, or other minister of the king who
is answerable at the ex-chequer, such tallies, writs, and franchises as are
allowable in the account shall be allowed. . . . And if the treasurer and the
barons of the exchequer do not act in the manner aforesaid, the plaintiffs
shall enjoy [the right of] recovery through petition in parliament.</p>
<p>25&#0160; Whereas
ordinary merchants and many others of the people are allowed to bring pleas of
debt and trespass in the exchequer, through the fact that they are received by
the ministers of the said court more favourably than they should be—whereby
accounts and other concerns of the king are greatly delayed and, in addition, a
large number of people are aggrieved—we ordain that henceforth no pleas shall
be held in the said court of the exchequer except pleas touching the king and
his ministers : [namely] those answerable at the exchequer by reason of their
offices, the ministers of the court &#0160;itself, and their subordinates and servants
who most of the time are with them in those places where the exchequer may be.
And if anybody s received by the said court with permission to plead in the
manner aforesaid, those impleaded shall have their [right to] recovery in
parliament. </p>
<p>26&#0160; Item,
whereas the people feel much aggrieved because stewards and marshals hold many
pleas that do not pertain to their offices and also because they will not
receive attorneys for defendants as well as for plaintiffs, we ordain that
henceforth they shall receive attorneys for defendants as well as for
plaintiffs, and that they shall hold no pleas of freehold, debt, covenant, or
contract, nor any common plea touching men of the people—saving [to their
jurisdiction] only trespasses of the household itself other trespasses
committed within the verge [i.e. the
area distinguished by the king’s presence and thereby set apart from common
law], and contracts and covenants which anyone of the
king&#39;s household may make with another of the same household within the
household itself and not elsewhere. . . .</p>
<p>28&#0160; Whereas
the people feel much aggrieved because men are emboldened to kill and rob by
the fact that the king, through evil counsel, so lightly grants them his peace
against the provisions of the law; we ordain that henceforth no felon or
fugitive shall be protected or defended in any sort of felony by the king&#39;s
charter granting his peace, except only in case the king can give grace
according to his oath, and that by process of law and the custom of the realm.
And if any charter is henceforth made and granted to any one in any other
manner, it shall be of no avail and shall be held as null. And no recognized
malefactor against the crown and the peace of the land is to be aided or
maintained by any one </p>
<p>29&#0160; Whereas
in the king’s court persons find their cases delayed because a party alleges
that in the king&#39;s absence answer should not be made to demands, and [whereas]
also many persons wrongfully suffer injuries from the king&#39;s ministers, with
regard to which injuries one can secure recovery only in common parliament; we
ordain that the king shall hold a parliament once a year, or twice if need be,
and that in a convenient place. And [we ordain] that in those parliaments pleas
which are delayed in the said manner, and pleas wherein the justices are of
different opinions shall be recorded and settled. And likewise those bills
which are brought to parliament shall be settled as heretofore in accordance
with law and right. </p>
<p>30&#0160; Whereas
all the people suffer greatly in many ways whenever a change of money is made
in the kingdom, we ordain that, when there &#0160;is need and the king wishes to make a change,
he shall do so by the common counsel of his baronage, and that in parliament</p>
<p>31&#0160; Item,
we ordain that all statutes which were made in amendment of the law and for the
benefit of the people by the ancestors of our lord the king shall be kept and
maintained as heretofore in accordance with law and right, provided that they
are not contrary to the Great Charter or to the Forest Charter or to the
ordinances by us made. And if any statute is made contrary to what has been said,
it shall be held as null and as utterly void</p>
<p>32&#0160; Whereas,
to the great injury of the people, the law of the land and common right have
often been delayed by letters issued under the king&#39;s privy seal, we ordain
that henceforth neither the law of the land nor common right shall be delayed or
disturbed by letters under the said seal. And if, through such letters issued
under the privy seal contrary the right or to the law of the land, anything is
done in any session of the court of our lord the king, it shall be of no avail
and shall be held as null. </p>
<p>33&#0160; Whereas
many of the people other than those known to be merchants feel much aggrieved
and injured by the Statute of Merchants made at Acton Burnell, we ordain that
hereafter this statute shall hold&#0160; only
as between merchant and merchant and with regard to dealing made between them. .
. </p>
<p>38&#0160; Item,
we ordain that the Great Charter of Liberties and the Forest Charter issued by
King Henry, son of King John, shall be observed in all their particulars, and
that points in the said charters of liberties which are doubtful shall be explained
in the next parliament after this by the advice of the baronage, the justices,
and other persons learned in the law. And this is to be done because we are
unable to attend to the matter during our term [of office]. </p>
<p>39&#0160; Item,
we ordain that the chancellor, the Treasurer, the chief &#0160;justices of both benches, the chancellor of
the exchequer, the treasurer of the wardrobe, the steward of the king&#39;
household, and all justices, sheriffs, escheators, constables, investigators
for any cause whatsoever, and all other bailiffs and ministers of the king,
whenever they receive their offices and bailiwicks, shall be sworn to keep and
observe all the ordinances made by the prelates, earls, and barons for that
purpose elected and assigned—[to maintain] every one of those [ordinances]
without contravening them in any particular. </p>
<p>40&#0160; Item,
we ordain that in each parliament one bishop, two earls, and two barons shall
be assigned to hear and determine all plaints of those wishing to complain of
the king&#39;s ministers, whichever they may be, who have contravened the
ordinances aforesaid. And if the said bishop, earls, and barons cannot all
attend, or are prevented from hearing and determining the said plaints, then
two or three of them shall do so. And those who are found to have contravened
the said ordinances, in the interest of the king and in the interest of the
plaintiffs, shall be punished at the discretion of the persons thus assigned. </p>
<p>41&#0160; Item,
we ordain that the aforesaid ordinances are to be maintained and observed in
all their particulars, and that our lord the king shall cause them to be issued
under his great seal and sent into every county of England, to be published,
held, and strictly kept as well within franchises as without. . . .</p>
<p>These ordinances, having
been shown to us and published on Monday next before the feast of St. Michael
just past, we agree to, accept, and confirm. And we will and grant, for us and
our heirs, that all and several of the said ordinances, made according to the
form of our letters aforesaid, shall be published throughout our entire realm,
henceforth to be strictly maintained and observed. In testimony whereof we have
caused these our letters patent to be drawn up. Given at London, October 5, in
the fifth year of our reign.</p>

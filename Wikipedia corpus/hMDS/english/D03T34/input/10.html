in 1264, Adrian Jobson has sought to synthesize current research on
the political struggles of the reign of Henry III, place them into
their own historical context, and finally explain why this "First
English Revolution," as he calls it, still resonates with us today.
Jobson argues that the period of reform and rebellion from 1258 to
1267 was crucial in the development of parliament and its final
emergence as "a formal consultative body that dealt with the 'common
business of the realm'" (ix-x).  Moreover, the imposition of conciliar
governance, the effective transfer of political power from the crown
to a corporate body, was far more radical than anything envisioned in
Magna Carta, and was to reverberate throughout the rest of the middle
ages in England.</p><p class="normal">Jobson begins by examining the origins of reform, which he locates in
the policies that Henry III had pursued from the beginning of his own
personal rule in 1234, policies that he sees as a continuation of the
approach advocated by the king's earlier mentor, Peter des Roches.
Henry's vision of kingship was shaped on the one hand in reaction to
the violent end of his father's reign and the imposition of Magna
Carta, and on the other hand by a notion of sacred kingship embodied
in the cult of Edward the Confessor, and exemplified by his brother-
in-law, Louis IX of France.  But whatever Henry's vision of kingship
might have been, he was constantly challenged by inadequate financial
resources to accomplish his goals.  Jobson provides an overview of
both the fiscal innovations introduced in the middle years of the
reign, and of the costly continental ambitions that quickly eroded any
progress in the royal finances.  Less obvious, but ultimately perhaps
even more important, was a social transformation taking place in the
thirteenth century, as the number of knights fell from 4,500 at the
beginning of the century to perhaps 1,250 at the end.  Overburdened as
local agents of the crown in the counties, this smaller elite group
became the leaders of gentry society and increasingly significant
politically.  Until 1258, Henry's ability to appease the greater
magnates of the realm, such as the earls of Gloucester, Norfolk, and
Hereford, prevented political discontent from turning into revolution.
But one more factor contributed to the destabilization of the regime,
and that was Henry's support of not one, but two, factions at court in
the form of his wife's Savoyard relations and his own Poitevin half-
siblings.  Henry's direction of the bulk of his patronage to one or
the other, particularly the Poitevins, alienated his magnates, and in
particular his brother-in-law, Simon de Montfort, who saw his own
obligations from the crown repeatedly overlooked.</p><p class="normal">Even with all of the factional strife present at the royal court,
Henry might have survived had he not indulged his continental
ambitions.  Failed campaigns in Brittany in 1230 and Poitou in 1242
were bad enough, while even more successful intervention in Gascony
was very costly in both financial and personal terms, but Henry's
involvement in the so-called Sicilian Business, in which he sought a
crown for his younger son Edmund, was the final straw for the
developing political opposition in England.  Exacerbated by Henry's
request for taxes to fund a war in Wales, as well as the continued
flaunting of the law by Henry's Lusignan kinsmen, the members of the
Westminster parliament of April 1258 started down the path to
revolution.  A powerful coalition of seven nobles, led by the earl of
Gloucester and Simon de Montfort induced the king to agree to a
committee of twenty-four, twelve to be chosen by the king and twelve
by the barons, to reform the governance of the realm.  Parliament met
again in June 1258, in Oxford, and was well attended not only by the
great magnates of the realm, but also by members of the knightly
class.  A Petition of the Barons, drawn up in advance for the
committee of twenty-four to consider, reflects the broadening of the
reform movement to include complaints not only about the royal
government, but the conduct of private lords as well.  The result of
the deliberations of this parliament was the Provisions of Oxford,
which Jobson examines in detail.  He also stresses the impact of
reform in the counties, particularly the work of the newly appointed
justiciar, Hugh Bigod.  Jobson also sees the sometimes overlooked
Ordinance of the Magnates of February 1259 as central to the overall
spirit of reform, as it formed a sort of "self-denying ordinance" by
which the behavior of the great landowners and their servants was to
be subjected to the same scrutiny as that of the king and his royal
officials.  The apogee of the reform movement came in October 1259 in
the Provisions of Westminster, which Jobson describes as "a veritable
smörgåsbord of legislative and administrative measures [that]
reflected the three core themes of the 'common enterprise': provision
of justice, law reform, and the supervision of policy making" (43).</p><p class="normal">The next five years saw a constantly shifting political balance of
power between the king and the reformers, and Jobson provides an
analysis of the character of both Henry III and Simon de Montfort as
central to this process.  Henry's departure for France in November
1259, in order to finalize the peace with France that would be
embodied in the Treaty of Paris was a turning point.  The question of
the dower of Eleanor de Montfort (Henry's sister and Simon's wife) was
finally resolved, on terms far more satisfactory to the king than the
earl.  Moreover, Henry used the occasion of the treaty to introduce a
new great seal, allowing him to issue royal orders without the
presence of the entire council.  After delays occasioned by the death
of the dauphin and the marriage of Henry's daughter Beatrice, Henry
wrote to postpone the Candlemas 1260 parliament, a clear challenge to
the Provisions of Oxford.  Following his belated return to England,
Henry successfully undermined the conciliar constraints that the
Provisions has placed upon his kingship, culminating in a release of
his obligations to adhere to any of the recent reforms in a bull of
Pope Alexander IV and his settlement with his barons in the Treaty of
Kingston in November 1261.  Soon however, Montfort appeared with a new
bull from the pope reversing course.  The pendulum swung back and
forth until both sides, king and reformers, turned to the king of
France for arbitration.</p><p class="normal">Simon de Montfort's refusal to abide by the terms of the resultant
Mise of Amiens, despite his prior commitment to do so, "in order to
conserve the Provisions of Oxford, because they were founded on the
Charter" (107), illustrates both his commitment to the reform movement
and his blindness to his own moral ambiguity.  He was a man of
principal only when principal was on his side.  Immediately after the
Mise he launched violent attacks on the lands of Roger Mortimer in the
Welsh Marches and sacked Worcester on 28 February 1264, where the
Jewish quarter was destroyed.  Henry unfurled the royal banner at
Oxford on 3 April 1264, initiating civil war.  Royalist successes in
the Midlands, at Northampton and elsewhere, placed Montfort in a
precarious situation, making his control of London imperative.  The
violence against the Jewish community in London, following the earlier
anti-Semitic violence in Worcester, is one of the darkest stains on
Montfort's reputation, but is often overshadowed by his military
brilliance.  Jobson provides a thorough and thoughtful discussion of
the battle of Lewes, Simon de Montfort's greatest victory.  The peace
settlement, the Mise of Lewes, was solidified by the subsequent London
parliament of June 1264--which included four knights as
representatives of each county--that issued the <span class="italic">Ordinatio</span> or
Ordinance, which fully embodied the principles of the Provisions of
Oxford.</p><p class="normal">Simon de Montfort's triumph, celebrated in the remarkable <span class="italic">Song of
Lewes</span>, was to prove short-lived.  Faced with opposition from both
the French court and papal curia, he was a somewhat isolated figure.
His need for widespread support at home may explain the inclusion not
only of county knights, but also burgesses from several towns
including York, Lincoln, and Sandwich and the Cinque Ports at the
Hilary parliament of 1265.  His enforcement of both the Provisions of
Oxford and the Provisions of Westminster was populist and popular, but
his own self-aggrandizement, both financial and military, was
decidedly not.  The ranks of the reformers soon began to fragment, and
the dramatic escape of Prince Edward from Hereford Castle in May 1265
provided a rallying point.  The royalist recovery culminated in
Edward's decisive defeat of Montfort at Evesham in August, where the
earl himself was killed along with thousands of his followers, and at
least thirty knights, an unprecedentedly high figure for the period.</p><p class="normal">The royalist policy following the triumph over Montfort is discussed
in Chapter 6, under the heading "Retribution and Reconciliation."
There was more of the former than the latter, and Jobson assigns the
blame for this as much to Henry himself as to the Lord Edward.  London
was restored to royal favor only after paying an enormous fine of
20,000 marks, while the Montfordian remnant, "the disinherited" were
eventually reconciled in the settlement known as the Dictum of
Kenilworth, which allowed them to recover their lands on payment of
substantial fines.</p><p class="normal">In his concluding chapter Jobson briefly sketches out the legacy of
the baronial reform movement in later English history.  After two
decades of what he describes as "pragmatic conciliation," by the 1290s
Edward I's heavy taxation in the face of multiple wars led to renewed
political tensions between the crown and its critics.  This culminated
in the <span class="italic">Confirmatio Cartarum</span> and the <span class="italic">Articuli super
Cartas</span>, both of which made conscious reference to the Montfortian
reforms.  So too the Ordinances of 1311 which imposed strict
limitations on Edward II's royal authority and made imaginable his
later deposition.  While Edward III largely avoided confrontation with
his magnates and the county communities, his grandson Richard II once
again faced limitations on royal power not only during his minority,
but also in his adult years.  He too was ultimately deposed.  Jobson
sees a conscious parallel in the reign of Charles I, where Edward Coke
looked back to thirteenth-century precedents in arguing against royal
power, and men like John Pym and John Hampden challenged the
absolutist tendencies of the second Stuart king.  Indeed, Jobson
suggests that while "the public execution of Charles I may have been
an unprecedented act in English history...it can be seen as a natural
development in a cumulative process that had originated in the 1260s"
(173).</p><p class="normal">This is a book that requires a certain amount of background knowledge,
but advanced undergraduates will find it useful as a roadmap through
the complicated political thicket of the 1250s and 1260s, as well as
through the equally complex historiography of the period.  Along with
published works, Jobson has made considerable use of a number of
recent, unpublished, doctoral dissertations.  His bibliography
provides an up to date resource, indicative of the considerable work
done on the reign of Henry III in the last several decades.

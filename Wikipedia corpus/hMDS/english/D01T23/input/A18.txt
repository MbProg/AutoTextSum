Hi everyone!
It’s Pierre-Antoine (again)!
Did you watch Wimbledon last weekend?
My predictions were… divided.
Murray and Djokovic won their semi finals and Murray won the championship (as I said)!
With the public, the Scottish player was so motivated and so much better than the world number 1.
He merits his victory.
However, I said that the winner of the women’s final would be Lisicki.
Finally, our French player Marion Bartolli won!
Shame on me… She was the best during the whole match.
Concentrated and precise, she just won her first grand slam tournament!
Today I’m going to tell you about a famous symbol of the Britain monarchy: Buckingham Palace!
I took this photo of Buckingham Palace a few weeks ago.
You can also see the Victoria Memorial on the left.
Buckingham Palace – Did you know?
As everybody must know, Buckingham Palace is the residence of the royal family in London!
But, did you know that in the beginning, “Buckingham” was a house of the Duke of Buckingham in 1706?
The house was acquired only in 1761 by King George III as a royal private residence.
How did a “simple” private house became the official royal residence?
Well, thanks to Queen Victoria and a lot of hard work to renovate the house, “Buckingham House” became “Buckingham Palace” in 1837.
Queen Victoria was the first monarch to reside in Buckingham Palace.
She moved into Buckingham Palace on 13th July 1837.
So tomorrow, Saturday, will be 176 years that the monarchy has been living in Buckingham Palace!

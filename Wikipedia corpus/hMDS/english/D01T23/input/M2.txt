“Dull”
4 of 5 stars Reviewed December 17, 2014
The unmistakeable Buckingham Palace is the London residence and principal workplace of the monarchy of the United Kingdom.
Built in 1703, the building is quite plain and dull and unsurprisingly surrounded by fencing on all sides.
It is also always covered in tourists and a flock of diseased looking pigeons.
Unfortunately, the Queen is presently in residence and internal tours were not allowed when we were there making it a mere 30 minute compulsory tourist stop, essentially to tick the ‘done’ box.

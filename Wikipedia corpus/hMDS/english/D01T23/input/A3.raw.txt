Top 10 London for First timers
written by That Girl March 20, 2016
If you know me well, you would know how much I love London. If there is any place I would like to settle down, apart from India, it has toÂ be London. I had been to London for a week along with my family, almost 3.5Â years back. While revisiting the memories, I noticed how being first timers, we had been to most of the must visit places. And hence, out of the many places we had been to, I give you my very own Top 10 places in London, which you shouldnâ€™t miss if you are a first timer ! ðŸ™‚
1. Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament
The first glimpse of this structure over awes you. On our first day, we spent quite sometime just looking at the structure â€“ the features, the architecture and the clock. Surely, we wereÂ having that â€˜Yes, we are in Londonâ€™ moment and that feeling sunk in best when in front of this huge building.
2. Westminster Abbey â€“ Adore the interiors
Who would want to missÂ the place whereÂ Prince William and Katherine Middleton got married ? We were absolutely spell bound by the interiors of this church.Â  It is one of the most notable religious buildings in the United Kingdom and has been the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English and, later, BritishÂ monarchs.
3. Buckingham Palace â€“ Visit Queen & See Change of Guards
Buckingham Palace is the London residence and principal workplace of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom. You donâ€™t want to miss the Changing of Guards ceremony.Â The Forecourt of Buckingham Palace is used for Changing of the Guard, a major ceremony and tourist attraction (daily from April to July; every other day in other months).
4. London Zoo â€“ Ponder at meditatingÂ Llamas
London Zoo is the worldâ€™s oldest scientific zoo .Â It was opened in LondonÂ inÂ 1828. You willÂ find hundreds of varieties of mammals, birds, amphibians and more. What IÂ loved the most were the cute Llamas. You can spend hours just watching them. Also penguins â€“ the cutest ones are there in this zoo.
5. Windsor CastleÂ â€“ Pose with a Guard
Windsor Castle is theÂ Queenâ€™sÂ royal residence inÂ the English county of Berkshire. The original castle was built in the 11thÂ century. It goes without saying that you would love to pose with the stoic guards there. But beware, donâ€™t mess with them, or this could happen withÂ you.
6. Trafalgar Square â€“ Climb up the Lion(s)
Trafalgar Square is a public square in the Central London, built around the area formerly known as Charing Cross.Â Its name commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar, a British naval victory in the Napoleonic Wars withÂ France and Spain that took place in 1805. This placeÂ is surrounded by museums, galleries, cultural spaces and historic buildings.Â Nelsonâ€™s Column at itâ€™s centre is guarded by four lion statues. You can climb up these lions. But my experience says, it is impossible to climb the lions hereÂ and retain your dignity. But again, where else can you sit on a lion?
7. Pose with any of the iconic telephone booths
The red telephone box, a telephone kiosk for a public telephone designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, was a familiar sight on the streets of London.Â Despite a reduction in their numbers in recent years, the traditional British red telephone kiosk can still be seen in many places throughout London. The colour red was chosen to make them easy to spot. You HAVE to click aÂ picture here.
8. London Eye â€“ Ogle at it or from it !
The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London.Â When erected in 1999 it was the worldâ€™s tallest Ferris wheel.Â The Eye has done for London what the Eiffel Tower did for Paris, which is to give it a symbol and to let people climb above the city and look back down on it. Watching both from it and at it are trip worthy.
9. Harrods â€“ Buy something â€“ tea bags at the very least !
Harrods is an upmarket department store located in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Just say the word â€˜ Harrods â€™ and images of stylish luxury fill my mind from Yves Saint Laurent couture to Steiff teddy bears, not forgetting, the famous food halls of this, the largest department store in Europe. Â Covering over 4.5 acres and spread across 5 floors, it is easy to get lost here!Â It gives you a symbol a luxury identity. When in London, donâ€™t miss out going on a luxury shopping spree in Harrods. If nothing else, definitely buyÂ their tea bags!
10. TowerÂ Bridge â€“ See it falling down and going up again
Tower Bridge (built 1886â€“1894) is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London.Â It is spectacular to watch the bridge opening to let the tall ships pass by and then closing again to resume vehicular traffic. We went there almost everyday.

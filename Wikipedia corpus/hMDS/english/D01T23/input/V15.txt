John Nash's Architecture
One of the greatest          architects of metropolitan London during the Regency era (c.1810-30),          John Nash was a highly original and prolific designer, best known for          the neoclassical          architecture he used in the Marylebone region of London, notably Regent's          Park (1812-27), an impressive complex of rigorously classical buildings.
Part of the Picturesque movement, he combined irregular views with Neoclassical          structures, making use of the widest variety of styles and urbanistic          ideas.
In addition, he was among the initiators of the revival of Gothic          and Renaissance architecture , Exoticism,          and similar styles, that became typical of 19th          century architecture in England.
His most famous examples of classicism included city terraces in London (Royal Mews 1825; Cumberland Terrace          1828; Carlton Terrace 1827-32), major urban structures (Theatre Royal          Haymarket 1820), country houses and castellated villas (East Cowes Castle          1798-1802; Ravensworth Castle 1808), and picturesque cottages (Blaise          Hamlet 1810-11).
He also designed the neoclassical All Souls Church in          Langham Place (182224), and the gothic-style St. Mary's Church Haggerston          (182527).
His most unorthodox building was the Royal Pavilion in          Brighton (1815-22) - a fantastic version of Indian design, with elements          of Chinese, Moorish and Gothic          architecture .
The layout of the West End of London, including Trafalgar          Square, St James's Park, and the Royal Mews off the Mall, owes a great          deal to his innovative designs and planning.
He also worked on Buckingham          Palace, although here he was less unsuccessful and after the King's death          he lost his royal commissions.

Biography
Born in Lambeth, the son of a millwright,          Nash trained with the architect Sir Robert Taylor (1714-88) and began          as a surveyor and builder, before opening his own architectural practice          at the age of 25.
Alas, despite receiving a substantial family inheritance          of £1000 in 1778, Nash's decision to invest in property proved unwise          and he was declared bankrupt five years later.
After this, he left London          and settled near his mother in Carmarthen, Wales.
It was in Wales that          he completed his first important projects of late-18th          century architecture , the prisons at Carmarthen (1789-92), Cardigan          (1791-96) and Hereford (179296).
He also renovated St David's Cathedral          (1789-91) by adding two large flying buttresses, and designed Castle House          Aberystwyth (1795) in Picturesque style.
In addition, he designed a dozen          small country houses or "villas", located throughout South Wales,          such as Llanerchaeron (c.1795).
While working in the principality, Nash          formed a profitable 8-year partnership with landscape gardener Humphrey          Repton (1752-1818).
Then in 1797 he returned to London.
His first major project after settling          in London was out of town.
In 1798 he designed his own summer residence,          East Cowes Castle, on the Isle of Wight.
It was the first of a number          of picturesque Gothic castles that he would build across England.
(Later          he also built his own town house at No.14 Regent street: 1819-23).
Other          Nash "castles" - all executed in the asymmetrical and picturesque          style of architecture - included:          Luscombe Castle, Devon (180004); Ravensworth Castle, North Durham          (begun 1807); Caerhays Castle, Cornwall (180810); Shanbally Castle,          County Tipperary (1818-19).
To these, Nash added groups of buildings,          such as Blaise Hamlet (18101811), considered by some critics to          be the last word in the Picturesque idiom.
Another type of design he produced          was the Italianate Renaissance-style villa, as exemplified by Cronkhill          (1802), Sandridge Park (1805) and Southborough Place, Surrey (1808).
Architect to the          Prince Regent: Regency Architecture
Politically, Nash was a supporter of the          Whig party and a friend of Charles James Fox (1749-1806).
Through this          and other contacts, Nash came to the attention of the English Prince Regent,          later King George IV (1762-1830).
As a result, in 1806, Nash was given          the position of architect to the Surveyor General of Woods, Forests, Parks,          and Chases, and, from 1810, worked almost exclusively for the King.
In          this position he became an important exponent of the Regency Style          of architecture - a style inspired by Greek          art of classical antiquity.
The first major royal commission was the          development of Marylebone (today's Regent Street, Regent's Park and St          James's Park).
With the assistance of other architects including James          Pennethorne (1801-71) and Decimus Burton (1800-81), Nash designed Carlton          House Terrace (18271832), Park Crescent (1812-21), and Park Square          (182324), as well as villa developments like Park Village East and          Park Village West (182334).
In addition, Nash was responsible for          the planning and completion of Regent's Canal (1812-20).
Other royal commissions included the design          of two of London's theatres: the King's Opera House (now, Her Majesty's          Theatre) (18161818), and the severely neoclassical Theatre Royal Haymarket (1821), with its hexastyle Corinthian columns.
After this came the redesign of Buckingham House, creating Buckingham          Palace (18251830), followed by the Royal Mews (182224) and          Marble Arch (1828).
Nash's career and influenced declined abruptly          with the death of George IV.
Both the King's extravagance and Nash's own          success had attracted considerable resentment.
The huge cost of his work          on Buckingham Palace, in particular, caused enormous controversy, and          effectively denied him the knighthood traditionally awarded to royal architects.
In response, Nash retired to his home on the Isle of Wight.
Royal Pavilion,          Brighton (1815-22)
This was Nash's most unusual and exotic          architectural design.
Starting out as the Prince's Marine Pavilion, it          became the Royal Pavilion, on completion.
It was originally built by Henry          Holland (1745-1806).
Nash transformed it from an earlier Palladian-style          house into a flamboyant example of eclectic, whimsical Picturesque architecture,          to host the summer entertainments of the Prince Regent.
Modelled on Mughal          architecture, which lent it it a distinctly exotic appearance, its exterior          - complete with minarets and bulbous onion domes - resembles the geometrically          disciplined Taj Mahal at Agra, Northern India          (1630-53).
Its more unorthodox features included: a gothic-parapeted,          circular staircase in the castellated turret provides access to the upper          dome, which was modified to accomodate three bedrooms, each with a fireplace          and windows; and a marquee-style roof of the pagoda dome above the Banqueting          Room and Music Room.
For the interior, cast-iron was disguised as bamboo          and gas-lighting was installed to display the brilliant chinoiserie to its greatest effect.

Note: Regency architecture broadly coincided          with the Biedermeier style in Germany/Austria lands, the Federal style in America and the Napoleonic          Empire style in France.
It was followed in Britain by Victorian          architecture , whose two most popular styles were Neo-Gothic and Jacobethan.

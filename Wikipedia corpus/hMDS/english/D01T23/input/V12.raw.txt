BP was bought by George III for £28000 in 1761, so she would have a good case for arguing that she gets to keep it.
we might have to ask if shes got a receipt though.

The queen owns Sandringham and Balmoral. George III agreed to hand over the Crown Estates in return for a yearly sum (Civil List). George originally bought it from the Duke Of Buckingham and it was called Buckingham House

A glance round all the neon signs in the West End on any given night, will make you realise that singling out Buck House for criticism, is totally wrong.

Well actually if people had a look they will find the Queen is not that often staying overnight at Buckingham Palace , she is more often at Windsor , I doubt she has personally decided to light up her outside walls at night.
As for the tax payer bit well the Government constantly revels in releasing the Civil List 9 the salary paid ion return for the proceeds of the Crown estate being handed to the Treasury ) paid to the Royals which stands at £37 million. Out of that £37 million , actually only £ 11.2 million goes on the civil list which covers the expenses of the royal family and the cost of staff and the running of establishments.
Now even if we did not have a Royal Family , the staff and offices would still be run as they would probably be serving a President instead.
Then the rest of the expenses to make it up to £37 million wich are £ 28,800,000.00 would still be needed if we had a President as these are for various costs including State visits by the Head of State , various functions here in the UK ordered by the Government which would be held by a President instead.
The turnover of the Crown Estate in 2005 was £245.4 million ,after all costs , taxes etc were deducted the profit handed over to the treasury was £ 184.8 million an increase of 4.5 % on 2004.
So in real terms if you take the profit of £184.8 million minus the costs of the Royal Family as they are called ) of £37 million and remember we would still have most of these costs with a President ) then they actually did not cost us anything , in fact they contributed £147.8 million .
As for the lights outside Buckingham Palace , I doubt very much it was the Queens idea if it was she would have done it years ago . When it comes to power and looking to the future there is  already  a hydro electric plant built to power Windsor Castle.

I really do not get whgy people are having a whinge about Buckingham Palace being lit up at night. The Palace of Westminster is floodlit as is Big Ben , when was the last time anyone complained about the 11,500 lightbulbs that illuminate Harrods !!! 59 Lights at the Palace for the benefit of Tourists is terrible but 11,500 lights outside Mr Fayeds corner shop is ok ?
I have an odd feeling that it is just because she is the Queen that people decide to moan.
The real reason behind the illumination is Tourists, one of the major income earners for the capital. I run a  Hotel company , if I could have a penny for every time  I have heard " why is the palace not lit up" I would be a very rich man.
This is a sensible course of actio nthat puts Buckingham Palace in the same league as other improtant buildings that are illuminated at night and are featured on the London by Night sightseeing tours.
Also lets remember if we are looking at the environmental impact that even though  more expensive than regular bulbs, LED bulbs consume far  less power and do not get hot, this reduces risks of overheating and fire. They also have a longer life span of around 100,000 hours. Incandescent bulbs, tend to last only about 80000 to 25,000 hours.

“Dull”
Reviewed December 17, 2014
The unmistakeable Buckingham Palace is the London residence and principal workplace of the monarchy of the United Kingdom. Built in 1703, the building is quite plain and dull and unsurprisingly surrounded by fencing on all sides. It is also always covered in tourists and a flock of diseased looking pigeons. Unfortunately, the Queen is presently in residence and internal tours were not allowed when we were there making it a mere 30 minute compulsory tourist stop, essentially to tick the ‘done’ box.

“Don't go around December”
Reviewed December 17, 2014
Happened to be there to see changing of the guards. As it is December there were droves of people around who had already taken every available vantage point. Probably best to visit outside of December and the Christmas period for a nicer time. Barely got a glimpse of the process.

“Changing of the guard fun to watch”
Reviewed December 17, 2014
The changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace is a fun and great thing to see if you have enough time. It can get very crowded: I arrived at 10:30 am and it was already too packed to get a good view up by the fence, so I stood on the Victoria Monument to get a better view. It is a nice spectacle and it would be very fun for children to see. That being said, I don't think it is necessarily a must-see. I didn't take a tour of the palace itself so I can't comment on that, but I had fun watching all of the ceremony. Definitely arrive early if you want to get a good view right up by the fence.

“Happy to have visited it”
Reviewed December 16, 2014
Buckingham Palace is very regal & elegant. It was great to visit one of our Head of State's official palaces & although we missed the changing of the guard, it was still fantastic. One thing that you may have to clarify though, several internet sites & comments from local tour operators will claim that the changing of the guard is on an even numbered day. I can speak from personal experience that the changing of the guard is on an ODD numbered day & if it is raining-it don't happen either. No dramas though as the we had to visit was the 24/11/14 & the day before it was a top day in London (not, rained all day) so we missed out there. A bonus was though, a horse cavalry proceeded between Buckingham Palace & The Victoria Memorial.Quite spectacular & was a great consolation for missing the changing of the guard. Loads of people there & we where there on the off season, so just be patient to get a photo.

“Buckingham Palace 2014”
Reviewed December 16, 2014
We were able to book one of the inside tours. Better part of 2 hours. Very knowledgeable guide.
Combination of history arts and politics. We saw several rooms, where the queen greets the select few. Secret passage, unusual furniture, many well known artists' painting hanging on the walls. If you are interested in the British royals, this would be a very good tour. Expensive 75 pounds. It was on my wife's list.

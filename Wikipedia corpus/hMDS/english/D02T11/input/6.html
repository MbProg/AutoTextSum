  <p align="center"><strong>President Ngo Dinh Diem</strong></p>
  <p><strong>I will give the reader a very brief review of Ngo Dinh Diem, the first
  president of the Republic of Vietnam. I could write 10,000 words, and depending on my
  politics could make him into a great or a despised leader. This opening section is just
  meant to show the reader that Diem was fully supported by the United States until it
  became politically convenient to let him be killed.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Ngo Dinh Diem was born 3 January 1901 in Hue, Vietnam, the son of a minister.
  His family was Roman Catholic and his father was a counselor to the Vietnamese emperor. In
  September 1945, Diem was kidnapped by Viet Minh agents and taken to see Ho Chi Minh. Ho
  Chi Minh offered Diem a position in his Communist government, but Diem refused. Diem then
  traveled to the United States. He returned to Vietnam in 1954 where he was appointed Prime
  Minister.</strong></p>

  <p align="center"><strong>President Diem with President Eisenhower &#150; May 1957</strong><br>
  <strong>Eisenhower called Diem the &#147;miracle man of Asia.&#148;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>After the French retreated from Vietnam as a result of their defeat at Dien
  Bien Phu and the 1954 Geneva Accords, Diem led the effort to create the Republic of
  Vietnam. Because of his strong anti-Communist philosophy, the United States backed him
  with money and later, massive military support. </strong></p>
  <p><b>Mervyn Roberts makes some of the following points in his paper entitled: <i>United
  States psychological operations in support of counterinsurgency: Vietnam, 1960 to 1965</i>:
  </b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Edward G. Lansdale as Deputy Assistant to the Secretary Defense for Special
    Operations noted that without mobilizing their total resources, the South Vietnamese could
    do little more than postpone defeat. This mobilization required the assistance of expanded
    psychological operations. Lansdale noted that American criticism of Diem&#146;s leadership
    caused the president to feel isolated and that this led Diem to withdraw into a shell. In
    Lansdale&#145;s mind, Diem was the indispensable man. As Lansdale wrote, &#147;The next
    time we have become holier than thou, we might find it sobering to reflect on North
    Vietnam. Do the Soviets and the Chinese Communists give Ho Chi Minh a similar hard time,
    or do they aid and abet him?&#148;</b></p>
    <p align="center"><img src="DiemBanner.jpg" width="672" height="457" border="2"
    alt="DiemBanner.jpg (117241 bytes)"></p>
    <p align="center"><b>In order to unify the country, we need President Ngo Dinh Diem</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>This banner hung on the southern side of the Hien Luong Bridge on Highway 1, over
  the Ben Hai River, near the 17th parallel. This was the symbolic passage between North and
  South Vietnam after 1954.</b></p>
  <p><strong>Ngo Dinh Diem was the first president of South Vietnam. He took power on 26
  October 1956 after a disputed 1955 plebiscite. At first he was popular as the economy of
  the country prospered. However, Diem was a Roman Catholic and this led to problems with
  the Republic's Montagnard natives and its Buddhist majority. The Buddhists had a political
  agenda, and after several set themselves on fire, Diem gradually lost the backing of the
  United States. There were several attempts on Diem&#146;s life by his own military. From
  1954 onwards, the Americans had been urging political reforms upon Diem, who repeatedly
  promised that reforms would be made but never enacted any. With the support President
  Eisenhower of the United States, he refused to hold countrywide elections in 1956 (a
  stipulation of the 1954 Geneva Accords), fearing, almost certainly correctly, that he
  would lose to Ho Chi Minh.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Diem could justify his decision by saying that the Republic of Vietnam was
  democratic, made up of many different parties that would split the vote. The North, under
  Ho Chi Minh, was a dictatorship. The votes would be along party lines as directed by the
  party leadership. To hold a free election was to give away the nation. The United States,
  now operating under the &#147;Domino Theory,&#148; and fearful of a Communist takeover of
  all of Southeast Asia, supported him. In late 1957, with American aid, Diem
  counterattacked his critics. He used the help of the American Central Intelligence Agency
  to identify those who sought to bring his government down and arrested thousands. In 1959,
  Diem passed a series of acts known as Law 10/59 that allowed the government to hold
  someone in jail without formal charges if they were suspected of being a member of the
  Communist Party.</strong></p>

  <p align="center"><strong>President Diem Killed by Vietnamese Soldiers in Military Armed
  Personnel Carrier</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Generals in the Vietnam Army plotted a coup with the approval of U.S.
  officials. The impetus for the coup occurred on the night of 21 August 1963. Government
  forces throughout the country attacked Buddhist pagodas throughout South Vietnam.
  Thousands of Buddhists were arrested and more were beaten and injured. The United States
  blamed Ngo Dinh Nhu and his special forces for this attack, but wondered if he had the
  blessing of Diem. Ngo Dinh Nhu was the younger brother and chief political advisor of
  President Diem. He commanded the ARVN Special Forces, a paramilitary unit which served as
  the Ngo family's private army, and the Can Lao political apparatus which served as the
  regime&#146;s secret police. The people blamed the government and the United States who
  supported Diem and had trained the Special Forces troops used in the attack. Almost
  immediately, Kennedy was approached by his people who wanted to remove Nhu from power, and
  if Diem would not follow orders, the president himself. </strong></p>
  <p><b>Lieutenant Colonel Peter Francis Leahy adds in his Master of Military Art and
  Science paper entitled: <i>Why did the Strategic Hamlet Program Fail</i>?</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Frederick Nolting, U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam from 1961 to 1963, drew the
    conclusion that the inability of the U.S. administration to accept Diem's style of
    government resulted in the coup of I November 1963. Diem failed to match the standards of
    democratic government set by the United States and in spite of earlier pledges to refrain
    from interfering in the internal politics of South Vietnam, U.S. officials
    &#147;encouraged dissident generals to revolt.&#148; </i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>According to Stanley Karnow, President Kennedy gave the new Ambassador, Henry
    Cabot Lodge, the complete discretion to suspend U.S. aid to Vietnam. In a situation where
    the Diem regime was almost entirely dependent on U.S. financial support, this gave Lodge
    the mandate to manage U.S. policy in Vietnam, &#147;and the policy as Lodge defined It,
    was to topple the Diem regime.&#148;</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>It has been reported that Lucien Conein, a CIA operative, provided a group of
  South Vietnamese generals with $40,000 to carry out the coup with the promise that US
  forces would make no attempt to protect Diem. Other reports say that U.S. Ambassador Henry
  Cabot Lodge assured the Generals that the U.S. would not stand in their way. A top secret,
  three-page, eyes-only Ambassador Lodge, Department of State Telegram dated 24 August 1963
  says in part: </strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>US Government cannot tolerate situation in which power lies in Nhu&#146;s
    hands&#133;If, in spite of your efforts, Diem remains obdurate and refuses, then we must
    face the possibility that Diem himself cannot be preserved&#133;We must at same time also
    tell key military leaders that US would find it impossible to continue support GVN
    militarily and economically unless above steps are taken immediately which we recognize
    requires removal of Nhu&#146;s from the scene&#133;We recognize the necessity of removing
    taint on military for pagoda raids and placing blame squarely on Nhu&#133;If he remains
    obdurate&#133;we can no longer support Diem. You may also tell appropriate military
    commanders that we will give them direct support in any interim period of breakdown
    central government mechanism&#133;Needless to say; we have held knowledge of this telegram
    to minimum essential people and assume you will take similar precautions to avoid any
    premature leaks.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>So, being careful not to commit itself, the telegram sent months before Diem&#146;s
  murder wants the Nhu family fired from their various appointed government positions and if
  this is not done, tells the Vietnamese military there will be no more cash&#133;but if it
  is necessary to remove Diem, the US will provide support. It is what we call a
  &#147;smoking gun.&#148;</b></p>
  <p><strong>Diem learned about the coup and he and his brother fled to Cho Lon through a
  tunnel. After spending a day in the tunnel, they agreed to surrender to the generals. The
  generals said they would have a safe passage out of the country; but, on their way to get
  out of the country on 2 November 1963, the two were killed by troops who had their own
  agenda. Diem and his brother were assassinated in the rear of a personnel carrier. </strong></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="88NVN.jpg" width="500" height="241" border="2"
  alt="88NVN.jpg (16019 bytes)"></p>
  <p align="center"><b>Leaflet 88 &#150; President Nguyen Van Thieu &#150; Vice President
  Nguyen Cao Ky</b></p>
  <p><b>I have read some reports that imply that Nguyen Van Thieu might have been the person
  who ordered Diem killed. There is no evidence of this. Other reports say the order was
  given by General Duong Van Minh. Those reports claim that Minh did not believe he had
  enough support among the people if Diem attempted to return to power. Allegedly, the other
  generals in the plot were not told of Minh&#146;s plan and it caused a fracture that never
  healed and doomed the new government to failure. </b></p>
  <p><b>Diem was first replaced by General &#147;Big Minh&#148; Duong Van Minh. There were
  then a number of different leaders; Nguyen Thanh; Nguyen Van Thieu, Nguyen Cao Ky (Vice
  President and Prime Minister); Tran Van Huong; and right at the end - Big Minh again as
  the South tried to bargain with the oncoming victorious North Vietnamese Army. One
  Vietnamese told me that it reminded her of postwar Italy, with a new head of state every
  time you opened a newspaper. It was a mess, and one that the United States helped create.</b></p>
  <p><strong>The United States government first claimed that it had no knowledge of the coup
  that overthrew Diem, but later admitted that American officials met with the generals who
  organized the plot and gave them encouragement to go through with their plans. Diem simply
  would not allow himself to be ordered about by the Americans. He was the president of an
  independent country, but apparently was considered an impediment to the accomplishment of
  U.S. goals in Southeast Asia. President Kennedy was aware of the plot to overthrow Diem,
  but there is no evidence that he had knowledge of his assassination. Curiously, President
  Kennedy was assassinated three weeks later and some Vietnamese have called that karmic
  retribution.</strong></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="HoChiMinhBW2.jpg" width="216" height="313" border="2"
  alt="HoChiMinhBW2.jpg (142036 bytes)"></p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Ho Chi Minh</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Diem had been a strong anti-Communist and Ho Chi Minh allegedly said when
  hearing of the coup:</strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong><i>I can scarcely believe the Americans would be so stupid.</i></strong></p>
  <p><strong>The North Vietnamese Politburo was even more surprised:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong><i>The consequences of the 1 November coup d'état will be contrary to the
    calculations of the U.S. imperialists...Diem was one of the strongest individuals
    resisting the people and Communism. Everything that could be done in an attempt to crush
    the revolution was carried out by Diem. Diem was one of the most competent lackeys of the
    U.S. imperialists&#133;The coup d'état on 1 November 1963 will not be the last.</i></strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>To give an example of how the Viet Cong feared Diem we need only look at a catalog
  of VC leaflets disseminated in 1962 and filed in a United States Information Service
  booklet entitled <i>National Liberation Front Propaganda</i>. A brief look at some of the
  enemy leaflets discloses: An anti-Diem leaflet telling of Viet Cong victories against his
  army; a charge that Diem has killed elderly religious Vietnamese; a leaflet calling for
  the people to rise up against the oppressor Diem; A letter to the Vietnamese Army telling
  them that Diem is just carrying on French colonialism; a 41-page document alleging Diem
  crimes against the people; and a leaflet that said &#147;For the past eight years our land
  has been a sea of blood, all in a vain attempt to stop the revolution. I could add another
  dozen, but the reader can see that the Viet Cong considered President Diem to be a serious
  contender.</b></p>
  <p><b>The previously classified Confidential MACV Combined Intelligence Center <i>VC
  PROPAGANDA FACTBOOK</i> dated 29 March 1969 says about the Viet Cong&#146;s attacks on
  Diem:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Viet Cong propaganda initially assailed the Diem regime. All of Vietnam's
    troubles were blamed on the Diem government by the massive National Front for the
    Liberation of South Vietnam (NFLSVN) agitation, propaganda, and indoctrination program.
    The fall of the Diem regime on 1 November 1963 presented the NFLSVN with both an
    opportunity and a crisis. The virtual anarchy in the countryside presented the NFLSVN with
    an unprecedented opportunity to extend its control. The swift non-Communist takeover,
    however, presented the NFLSVN with a new enemy, the new military junta, which had new
    strengths and weaknesses. VC propaganda had concentrated its efforts at toppling the Diem
    government, but the sudden unexpected collapse of that government left a void in the VC
    propaganda program. </i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>CIA Director William Colby said the Diem assassination was &#147;America's primary
  error in Vietnam,&#148; and with proper backing Diem might have won the war in just a few
  years.</b></p>
  <p><b>Lyndon B. Johnson said about the Washington Liberals who hated Diem:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>They started on me with Diem. He was corrupt and he ought to be killed. So we
    killed him. We all got together and got a goddamn bunch of thugs and assassinated him.
    Now, we've really had no political stability </i>[in South Vietnam]<i> since then.</i></b></p>

  <p><strong>The independent researcher and author Nguyen Ky Phong had this to say about
  Diem:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong><i>Diem was not the best but he was much better than his predecessors,
    especially emperor Bao Dai. He also stood out among his contemporaries as an
    incorruptible, unapproachable anti-French patriot. His ascension to power was neither
    based on his relation with the colonialists or any power, at least before he was appointed
    Prime Minister by Bao Dai with American and French consent. While many Vietnamese national
    leaders indulged in the privileges that accompanied their positions, President Diem did
    not. He lived a life of an ascetic.</i></strong></p>
    <p><strong><i>He did have weaknesses. His dependency on his brothers and parochial and
    religious associates was too great to allow him to make an independent and realistic
    assessment of the actual situation in Vietnam. He traveled from time to time to visit his
    subjects, but some believe that the people he met were told what to say and how to act.
    There were reports that his three brothers used his name to build financial and political
    influence for themselves. Governmental and Civil Service procedures were not followed or
    enforced by the president, which caused grave discontent and distrust within the rank and
    file of civil servants. Certain military officers were promoted due to their wealth,
    family or connection with the president's staff or family. The position of Secretary of
    Defense was not filled until the final days of the regime. The position of Presidential
    Advisor was delegated to the president's brother (Ngo Dinh Nhu) without the consent or
    advice of the senate or any authoritative government agency. During the length of his
    presidency Diem was unable to fend off accusations of nepotism, cronyism and favoritism.<O:P></O:P></i></strong></p>
    <p><strong><i>The question of what might have happened if President Diem was left in power
    is difficult to answer. There were two earlier attempts to overthrow Diem. The abortive
    November 1960 coup d&#146;état should have been a warning to Diem but he failed to react
    or order any reform to appease the opposition. Could the Diem regime have survived had the
    United States not acquiesced to a coup to replace him? Would he eventually have changed
    his course, replaced his many yes-men and overhauled his entire administration? And, even
    if he were to do all that, would South Vietnam have survived the relentless and determined
    attacks from the Communist North? Diem was not allowed to live so we will never know might
    have happened.</i></strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Ken Welch says about the loss of President Diem in <i>Tiger Hound: How we Won the
  War and Lost the Country:</i></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>The strategic hamlet program was abandoned. The communists were thus given carte
    blanche to expand their efforts. Throughout the country, they simply walked into small
    villages and recruited people that already had weapons and training courtesy of the United
    States Army. The communists fully appreciated President Diem&#146;s strategic hamlet
    program. In the first 12 months following Diem&#146;s assassination, communists killed
    over 11,000 village officials.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Another Vietnamese national that lived through the Diem Regime said:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Diem and his family (Nhu and his wife) killed many people. I remember hearing
    whispers that if you didn't vote for Diem at the election time, you would have midnight
    visitors and that wouldn't be good for you. Vietnam at that time needed a strong leader to
    fight the war. Diem (and his family) was that, but they went too far with the Buddhists,
    most Vietnamese are Buddhists and many of them were in control of the armed forces back
    then. Diem should have focused his fight on the North and not with the Buddhists. Big Minh
    (Leader of the military coup) was a good Buddhist man. He loved his country and people. He
    was a good general but not strong and ruthless enough to lead the county. </i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>I have read reports by some Vietnamese that said that the Vietnam War was lost
  when Diem was killed. None of the later leaders were as strong anti-Communists as he was.
  After Diem&#146;s death there was a parade of leaders, none of whom showed any great
  leadership abilities. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>With the loss of Diem the United States was forced to send more troops to
  Vietnam and became more heavily involved in the fighting. The ultimate effect of United
  States participation in the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem was to commit Washington to Saigon
  even more deeply. Having had a hand in the coup, the United States had more responsibility
  for the South Vietnamese governments that followed Diem. The weakness of the Saigon
  government thus became a factor in U.S. escalations of the Vietnam War, leading to the
  major ground war that the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson opened in 1965 with the
  eventual deployment of 500,000 troops to Vietnam. We might say that the United States
  sealed its own doom and the death of 58,000 American soldiers when it took part in
  Diem&#146;s death.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>In the title above I talk of American betrayal. Why is that? I don&#146;t hold
  the United States responsible for the overthrow or death of Diem. The Americans knew a
  little of the coup but that was a Vietnamese operation. What bothers me is what came next.
  The United States could have backed the new regime and said that they were patriotic
  Vietnamese officers that wanted what was best for their nation. Nobody could fault the
  U.S. for that. Instead, American propagandists at the Joint United States Public Affairs
  Office (JUSPAO) prepared about a dozen leaflets that attacked Diem personally. Diem had
  been backed by the Americans so to turn on an old ally and publically insult and berate
  him is a betrayal in my eyes.</strong></p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><u>THE LEAFLETS</u></strong></h2>
  <p><strong>When I write these articles on wartime PSYOP I always try to find the most
  colorful and most illustrative leaflets available. Unfortunately, in the case of the
  anti-Diem leaflets, they are almost all text. Just a very few have illustrations. They
  also tend to be rather long with tedious political messages. I shall illustrate a few of
  the leaflets just to prove the theme of this article, but the reader should understand
  that in most cases I will cut the long messages down to only a few interesting lines. I
  only want to translate the more flammable text of the leaflets, not the entire messages.</strong></p>
  <p><b>Roberts mentions the campaign to vilify Diem and support the new government:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>On 2 November 1963, President Diem was overthrown and later murdered. Despite his
    shortcomings, Diem had made progress in unifying the nation and fighting an insurgency
    increasingly manned by Northerners. His death unleashed a period of instability at a vital
    moment that allowed the insurgency to grow to a structural threat to the nation. In the
    immediate aftermath of the coup, Vietnamese PSYWAR units were focused on explaining what
    had happened. A total of 140,000 leaflets were dropped by the 23rd Division during the
    first week of November 1963. The principal message consisted of explaining the coup
    d&#145;état and the new military government. As one MACV report described the process in
    Darlac Province, ten-man teams were attached to each district to provide each district
    with a means to counter VC propaganda against the new government.</i></b></p>

  <p><strong>Perhaps the earliest anti-Diem leaflet is SP-40. The &#147;SP&#148; was a

  <p><strong>This ends our brief look at the Vietnamese and American propaganda campaign to
  destroy the reputation and legacy of the First President of Vietnam. Diem was no angel,

  expect from a loyal ally. I think it is disgraceful.</strong></p>

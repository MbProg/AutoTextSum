            </p>
<p>In  1775 the Americans invaded Canada in a   two-pronged attack against Montreal and  Quebec that has been described   as having &quot;the improvised character of a  raid.&quot;  In defense the British    called out the primarily French Canadian militia but most of the men   refused to  serve, despite being threatened with excommunication,   because they regarded the  war as a British family quarrel of no   interest to them.  While the Canadians initially resisted the  efforts   of the British to involve them in the conflict, they were even more    resistant to helping the other side, support that the Americans had   considered  a sure thing; surely the French population would join the   fight for freedom in  light of their own presumed suffering under   British rule since 1763.  But the Americans had gravely misjudged the    situation, for most French Canadians perceived taking up arms <em>against</em> the British government as  equivalent to fighting <em>for</em> the former  colonies, and the &ldquo;Bastonnais&rdquo; were older, more hated   enemies than the British,  who had treated them with respect since their   defeat.  When the green, ill-disciplined American  troops entered   Canada, abusing the citizenry and mocking their religion, it  could no   longer be pretended that the old hostilities were dead.  Discord between   Catholic and Protestant that  had been encouraged by both sides for   over a century was too deeply ingrained.<br />

                    <p>The Quebec Act of 1774 recognized two   basic rights of the predominantly  French Canadian population, freedom   of religion and the right to live under  traditional French civil law.   It also gave the governor and council at Quebec  jurisdiction over the   Ohio country.  In  one stroke, the new law offended at least two   colonial  constituencies—traditional Catholic-hating New Englanders were   outraged because  they saw Britain caving in to Papists;   land-speculators—George Washington and  Benjamin Franklin among   them—were angry because they had their eye on lands in  the Ohio   territory.  Emotions ran high  and American colonists condemned the   Quebec Act as one of the &quot;Intolerable  Acts.&quot;  A flurry of publications    followed that argued against the Act and referred to Canadians in   hostile  terms.  When the Americans later looked  to those same   Canadians for support against the British, their hypocrisy was blatantly    apparent.  </p></td>

                    <p>Before  Benedict Arnold turned traitor   in 1780, he was widely considered one of the  most up-and-coming young   military leaders of the American Revolution.  The two-pronged American   offensive in Canada  had been authorized by Washington, with one army   traveling overland to attack  Montreal while a secondary force of 1,000   navigated up the Maine river system  to Quebec.  Benedict Arnold was   appointed  to command the Maine contingent.  Troops  were sent from   Boston to Newburyport, where river <em>bateaux</em> had been constructed   to transport the soldiers the 320  miles to Quebec.  The expedition   left on  September 19th, but since only green wood had been available   for construction  of the boats,few of the craft made  it beyond the   first third of the journey.   The inexperienced troops, ill-prepared for   the hardships, slogged on—a  third turned back, a hundred died of   exposure, and survivors were reduced to  eating soap, shoe leather, and   cartridge boxes.   About 600 finally reached the St. Lawrence River on   November 9th where  they were joined by General Montgomery with 300 more   men.  The combined forces began the siege of Quebec  on November 19th.  </p></td>

They had no possibility of    obtaining any more provisions than they carried with them, till they   came to  Canada, either by force or otherwise, and it was uncertain when   they should  arrive there. </p>

                    <p>Invested  in a siege that could last   for months and faced with their troops' expiring  enlistments on January   1, the American commanders arranged an attack on Quebec's  formidable   defenses for the early morning of December 31, 1775.  The attack was   quickly detected (Murray in  his <em>Impartial history</em>, claimed   they  were given away by a traitor) and Montgomery and fifty others were   killed.  Arnold and thirty-six others were wounded and  387 Americans   were taken prisoner.   British losses were seven killed and eleven   wounded.  Direct attack had failed, but a siege dragged  on throughout   the winter.  By spring it  was obvious that the Americans could not take   Quebec, and in May, when the  British fleet sailed up the St. Lawrence   toward the capital, the Americans fled  after the battle of Three Rivers   on June 8.   This is a French copy of a British map published the   previous year in  London. </p></td>

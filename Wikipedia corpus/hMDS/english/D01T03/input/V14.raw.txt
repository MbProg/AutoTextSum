Vishnu at Angkor Wat, Cambodia
Posted by Michael Lai on March 30, 2013

At the western entrance of Angkor Wat  stands this 5 meters tall statue of  Vishnu, known locally as Ta Reach, revered by Hindus and Buddhists alike for its representation of the “King of the ancestors and spirits”. It is carved from a single piece of  sandstone and is draped with colorful clothing and  offerings from pilgrims visiting the site.
Angkor Wat was dedicated to Vishnu who is the supreme God in the Vaishnavite tradition of Hinduism and venerated as one of the five primary forms of God . This standing stone statue has eight arms and the head of Buddha. When Angkor Wat became a Buddhist temple, the head of Vishnu was replaced with the head of Buddha.
In my impression, Angkor Wat has several basic colors – green for the trees, light brown for their roots, blackish grey for the stones. What I like in these photos is  the contrast between the dark monochromatic body of the statute and the bright colors on the clothes and the parasol. The bright colors really stood out from the whole setting!

I really like the parasol hanging over Vishnu.  I was wondering if people lived here day to day or if it was basically just a place to worship.

I really like the richness of this image–the color is sumptuous and really does add to the monochromatic tones of the wall and statue-this must have been amazing to see in person!

The waters are regarded as holy, given the sacred carvings which also include a stone representation of the Hindu god Vishnu lying on his serpent Ananta, with his wife Lakshmi at his feet.

In my opinion, Angkor Wat and Prambanan (Roro Jonggrang) have the same architecture. May be I should visit Angkor Wat to see it closely.

Dear Mr Lai,
Ver well taken picture indeed.its very captivating.But there is one thing that caught my attention specifically in your blog above.Its the replacement of vishnu’s head with buddha’s head.I have read asked people who have written books on hindu mythology and some told me that it isnt true.While it sure seems like like buddha’s head because lord vishnu is never portrayed anywhere with closed eyes in meditation while in a standing posture.Can you shed some more light on it?I would much appreciate it.
Thanks and good luck

I don’t know that much about it too.
The literature only said, the head was changed to the Buddha head when the country was turned into Buddhism. I have no idea whether the present head is one of the Buddha!

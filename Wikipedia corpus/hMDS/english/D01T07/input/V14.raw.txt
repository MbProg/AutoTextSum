Albrecht Altdorfer was an iconic German painter, printmaker, engraver, drafter and architect of Renaissance era who is best celebrated as the creator of the scariest painting in the world, “The Battle of Issus”. He is considered one of the founders of landscape paintings, one who established landscapes as one of the independent genres of painting. He belonged to the Danube School and contributed immensely towards its reputation of being ahead of its time. His father, Ulrich Altdorfer, a painter and miniaturist inspired him to pursue art. It appears that he visited Italy during his lifetime, as the 'Italian influence' is quite evident in his masterly handling of spatial construction in the “St. Florian Legend of St. Sebastian” and the “Passion of Christ” altar panels. Although there is no evidence of his visit to Italy, it is evident that Altdorfer utilized Italian niello work and the engravings of Marcantonio Raimondi and Andrea Mantegna. To know more about his childhood, life and timeline, explore the biography further.
Albrecht Altdorfer’s Childhood And Early Life
Altdorfer was born in Regensburg or Altdorf around 1480, although there is a certain degree of dubiety regarding the exact date and the birthplace of Altdorfer. But his name remained associated with the Bavarian city of Regensburg throughout his life. In 1505, he acquired the citizenship of Regensburg, the free imperial city situated on the Danube River and spent most of his life there. He was also known as the “Painter from Amberg,” a town north of Regensburg. His interest in art was perhaps stirred by his father, Ulrich Altdorfer, a painter and miniaturist. At the early stages, he drew public attention through his bohemian works. However, there are very few records of Altdorfer’s travels. It is said that he travelled along the Danube River and south into the Alps where he was so enthralled by the scenic beauty that he became the first of the modern landscape painters and established landscape as an independent genre. This also made him the leader of the Danube school in West Germany. In 1513, while being at the service of Maximilian I in Innsbruck, he received many commissions from the royal court. For Duke William IV of Bavaria, he painted “The Battle of Alexander at Issus” in 1529. In his lifetime, he was greatly influenced by the artists such as Giorgione and Lucas Cranach, which is quite evident from his work “Crucifixion”. While in Vienna he painted the small panel of St. George in the Forest (Laubwald mit dem Heiligen Georg) in 1535.
 
Personal And Political Life
By 1513, Altdorfer was married and bought a house in Regensburg “with a tower and farmstead". He bought another house in 1518 and a third one in 1532. He also owned several vineyards. Throughout his life, Altdorfer remained involved in city politics. In 1519, he became a member of city council for external affairs and in 1526, he was elected member of the city council for internal affairs. In the year 1526, he was also appointed as the city architect after which he built a municipal slaughterhouse and a building for wine storage. On18th September 1528, he was elected the prestigious office of the Mayor, which he declined. His wife died in the year 1532, leaving him a childless widower. In 1529-30, he was entrusted with the charges of city fortification in the light of an anticipated Turkish attack. However, the reason as registered in the annals of Regensburg Council reads: “He much desires to execute a special work in Bavaria for my Serene Highness and gracious Lord, Duke Wilhelm." The “work” was “The Battle of Alexander at Issus.”
During his lifetime, the city encountered many convulsions such as the Protestant Reformation and the expulsion of the Jews.He is said to have participated in the Council's decision to expel the city's Jewish community in 1519, as well as making two famous etchings of the synagogue just before it was destroyed after the expulsion, to be replaced with a church. Later, he became a Protestant, and helped to drive Regensburg to Lutheranism. Albrecht's brother, Erhard Altdorfer, was also a painter and printmaker in woodcut and engraving, and a student of Lucas Cranach the Elder.
Paintings
Owing to Albrecht Altdorfer’s contributions, the reputation of Danube School reached sky high and was considered of being ahead of its time. Though most of his paintings were religious, he was one of the first to practice landscapes as an independent genre and helped to introduce landscapes as themes of their own in painting. His most outstanding works are historical or biblical subjects in atmospheric landscapes. Two of his finest landscape paintings are,” Landscape with Footbridge” of 1518-1520, which is said to be the first pure landscape in oil and “View of the Danube Valley near Regensburg”. The masterpieces of his expressionistic religious arts are “The Legend of St. Sebastian” and “The Passion of Christ” of the so-called Sebastian Altar in St. Florian's Priory (Stift Sankt Florian) near Linz, Austria.
 
Paintings In Munich
“The Battle of Alexander at Issus” was commissioned by William IV, Duke of Bavaria, as a part of a series of eight historical battle scenes to be hung in the Residenz in Munich. In his painting of “The Battle of Alexander at Issus,” Altdorfer delineates the moment in 333 B.C. when Alexander the great thrashed Darius III in a battle for supremacy in Asia Minor.
 
Print Maker
Albrecht Altdorfer was a renowned print maker with myriad engravings and almost ninety-three woodcuts. He often blended etching and engraving techniques in a single plate, and produced about 122 intaglio prints altogether.
 
Death And Legacy
Albrecht Altdorfer died on 12 February at Regensburg in the year 1538. Apart from the will, which he dictated on the day of his death, there are no surviving papers or letters by him. There are very few contemporary writings contemporary about him as well. The closest thing to a portrait of Altdorfer is found in an illumination in the Freiheitenbuch (1536; Regensburg, Stadtmus) by Hans Müelich, which represents him in minute profile among Regensburg’s city councillors.The agglomeration of Altdorfer’s surviving work consistsof 55 panels, 120 drawings, 125 woodcuts, 78 engravings, 36 etchings, 24 paintings on parchment and fragments from a mural for the bathhouse of the Kaiserhof in Regensburg. Today, a large fraction of his body of work can be seen at the Alte Pinakothek Museum in Munich,and in the National Gallery of London.

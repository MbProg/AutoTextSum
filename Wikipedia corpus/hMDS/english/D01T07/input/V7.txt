Albrecht Altdorfer (1480-1538)
The Northern          Renaissance German painter, etcher, engraver, draughtsman and architect,          active mainly in Regensburg, Albrecht Altdorfer is best known for his          paintings of historical and Biblical subjects, set in atmospheric landscapes,          such as Battle of Alexander at Issus (1529, Alte Pinakothek, Munich)          and Christ Taking Leave of His Mother (1520, National Gallery,          London).
Influenced by Italian Old Masters like Andrea Mantegna (1431-1406), as well as by other Northern          Renaissance artists like Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472-1553), and          the woodcuts and engravings of Albrecht Durer (1471-1528), Altdorfer was          also an influential member of the Danube          School (Donauschule) of landscape painting.
Appointed          town architect of Regensburg in his mid-40s, few of his architectural          designs survive, although his mastery of linear          perspective is evident in many of his pictures.
His architectural          paintings include works like the Italianate A Susanna and the Elders (1526, Alte Pinakothek, Munich) and the topographical Danube Landscape          with Castle (c.1520, Alte Pinakothek, Munich).
His later canvases          owed more to the new style of Mannerism .

Biography
We know nothing about Altdorfer's upbringing          or how he learned to draw and paint.
He is first mentioned as a resident          of Regensburg in 1505, and in 1513 purchased property in the city.
In          1510 he travelled into Northern Italy, where he absorbed works by Mantagna          and others.
In 1519 he was elected to the Regensburg municipal council,          and in 1526 to the higher council, serving a period as Mayor, and a 12-year          stint as town architect.
Designs attributed to him include that of the          pilgrim church Zur Schonen Madonna at Regensburg.
His chief art          patrons were Louis X and William IV, Dukes of Bavaria, and the Habsburg          Emperor Maximilan I. Altdorfer died at the age of 57.
His brother, Erhard          Altdorfer, a pupil of Lucas Cranach the Elder, was also a talented painter          and engraver.
Landscape Painting
Although familiar with all the painting-genres ,          Altdorfer was essentially a follower of Romanticism ,          and aligned himself with other Romantic          artists like Jorg Breu, Rueland Frueauf, Wolf Huber, and Lucas          Cranach , who painted pure landscapes without any human subjects.
Their          pioneering interest in capturing the dense German forests, as well as          the atmospheric sunsets and moonlight of the region (later depicted so          evocatively by Caspar          David Friedrich 1774-1840), has led to art historians cataloguing          them as the Danube School of landscape          painting .
Altdorfer was a leading exponent of the style, and his Landscape          with Footbridge (1517-20, National Gallery, London) is believed to          be the first ever pure landscape picture in oil.
His love of scenery and          nature is evident in many of his works, from his early St. George and          the Dragon (1510, Alte Pinakothek), to his later Battle of Issus (1529).
Religious Painting
Religious subjects occupied Altdorfer throughout          his painting career.
His finest religious          art , typically capturing intimate moments between Christ and his mother,          are painted in an intense, even expressionistic, style.
Perhaps his most          famous work is the set of altar panels The Legend of St. Sebastian and The Passion of Christ (after 1510) that he executed for          the St. Florian monastery outside Linz, Austria - a work exemplifying          his knowledge of Italian techniques in the handling of spatial construction          and perspective.
NOTE: North German religious            painting is exemplified by the work of the Cologne            School , which flourished under Stefan            Lochner during the mid/late 15th century.
Historical Pictures
Altdorfer's finest history          painting and arguably the most famous of all his compositions, is          his masterpiece - Battle of Alexander at Issus (1529) - painted          for the Bavarian Royal Court.
The culmination of several earlier paintings          on the subject of military battles which he had completed for Maximilian          I in his illuminated          manuscript Triumphal Procession (1512-14), the picture depicts          in vivid detail the battle scene at Issus between the armies of Alexander          the Great and the Persian Emperor Darius, set amidst a dominating, if          somewhat extravagant landscape.
Drawing
Altdorfer's skill at drawing is evident in his exquisite finished drawings of landscapes executed in          black pen with white highlights and watercolour on brown or blue-gray          paper.
In addition, he demonstrated an unusual creativity in manuscript          illumination and illustration.
Printmaking
Strongly influenced by the printmaking works of his great contemporary, the printmaker Albrecht          Durer , Altdorfer produced a wide range of miniature engravings, woodcuts and, in particular, etchings, many of which were landscapes.
A pioneer          of copper etching , later in his          career he often merged etching and engraving techniques in a single plate.
Among his most important prints were the          40 plates known as The Fall and Redemption of Man.
Paintings, etchings and engravings by Albrecht          Altdorfer can be seen in several of the world's best          art museums including the Alte Pinakothek in Munich and the National          Gallery in London.

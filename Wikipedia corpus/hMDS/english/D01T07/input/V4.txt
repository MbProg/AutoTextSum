The Battle of Issus (1529)
Albrecht Altdorfer (1482-1538)
Life and Work
The battle between Alexander the Great and the Persian King Darius III at Issus in 333 B.C. signalled the end of the Persian advance.
Altdorfer has chosen to show the decisive moment: Alexander has won and Darius has turned to flee.
This painting is part of the cycle of history paintings for the Munich Residence, commissioned by Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria and his wife Jacobaea of Baden.

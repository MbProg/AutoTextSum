Caption: English galley in the 16th-century Anthony Roll. These three rolls, presented to King Henry VIII in 1546, are a record of 58 ships of the English Tudor navy in the 1540s. Alongside the illustration of each ship are details of the crew, armament, equipment and size. This ship is called the 'Galley Subtle', a rare example of a Mediterranean-type galley. It was probably a ceremonial vessel. This artwork is from the second of the three rolls, and would have formed the centrepiece of the rolls when they were displayed side-by-side on a wall or table.

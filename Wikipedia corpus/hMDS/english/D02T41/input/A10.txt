There were plenty of steppe tribes/individuals before and during the Mongol Empire which were Christian, incidentally- mostly Nestorians, as the Church of the East was the only one which would evangelise so far out.
Islamic rulers had no problem with them preaching to non-Muslims, which meant that places like the Steppes were fertile ground for Nestorian conversions.
The Keraits, for example, were (supposedly, if Bar Hebraeus is to be believed) Christian from the 11th century, at least among their ruling clans- as well as various important Mongol nobles and wives such as Kitbuqa, Sorghaghtani Beki and Doquz Khatun.

My first old gods to finish game was as the Zoroastrian Empire.
I prepared for a century to get ready against the Mongols as I had only barely defeated the Seljuks.
The first battle my Shahanshah died, then his son was the one who lost the empire, and his son was the count of some insignificant castle in the Ilkhanate.
The Mongols converted Nestorian, and that made them even more vicious.
It was concerning at first, especially when the grand coalition of independent Persian Zoroastrians rose up, only the get massacred.
I had spent time usurping the title of my own duke, then getting an alliance of the last Zoroastrian Satraps, who were getting forcibly removed as the Mongols had essentially converted half the Empire and started taking out the Byzantines who had grown into the holy land since I only cared about keeping my own borders along with a couple of independent kingdoms in Turkestan and Arabia.
Eventually I lost, and the Mongols cut off my head.

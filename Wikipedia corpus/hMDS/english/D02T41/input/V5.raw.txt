In modern book culture, we have "flash-in-the-pan" novels and series that gain tremendous fame very quickly, but die and fall out of favor just as quickly as they rose (Twilight, 50 Shades of Grey, etc.). Is there any evidence of this happening, say, more than 100 years ago? Which authors/novels?

In Smedley Butler's famous essay "War is a Racket", he asserts the 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made over the course of WWI. Is this true and can we accurately attribute it to the war?

What did professionally trained, or otherwise well known classical guitarists during the 1950s-1970s think of popular guitarists like BB King, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page? Did they respect them as musicians, or think they were hacks?

Why didn't the Franco-Mongol alliance formalize in the 13th century? ( self.AskHistorians )

After reading a little about Rabban Bar Sauma, a Christian who made a pilgrimage from China to Jerusalum and later became the Mongolian ambassador to Europe, my question is why didn't the alliance form?
They seemed to have similar goals - taking out the Mamluks/Muslims.

      <p>The Mongol military organization was simple, but effective. It was based on an old tradition of the <!--del_lnk--> steppe, which was a <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/d/Decimal.htm" title="Decimal">decimal</a> system known in Iranian cultures since <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenid Persia, and later: the army was built up from squads of ten men each, called an <i>arbat</i>; ten <i>arbat</i>s constituted a company of a hundred, called a <i>zuut</i>; ten <i>zuut</i>s made a regiment of a thousand called <i>myanghan</i> and ten <i>myanghan</i>s would then constitute a regiment of ten thousand (<i>tumen</i>), which is the equivalent of a modern division.<p>Unlike other mobile-only <!--del_lnk--> warriors, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Xiongnu or the <!--del_lnk--> Huns, the Mongols were very comfortable in the art of the <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/s/Siege.htm" title="Siege">siege</a>. They were very careful to recruit artisans and military talents from the cities they conquered, and along with a group of experienced Chinese engineers and bombardier corps, they were experts in building the <!--del_lnk--> trebuchet, <!--del_lnk--> Xuanfeng catapults and other machines with which they could lay siege to fortified positions. These were effectively used in the successful European campaigns under General <!--del_lnk--> Subutai. These weapons may be built on the spot using immediate local resources such as nearby trees.<p>Within a battle Mongol forces used extensive coordination of combined arms forces. Though they were famous for their horse archers, their lance forces were equally skilled and just as essential to their success. Mongol forces also used their engineers in battle. They used siege engines and rockets to disrupt enemy formations, confused enemy forces with smoke, and used smoke to isolate portions of an enemy force while destroying that force to prevent their allies from sending aid.<p>The army&#39;s discipline distinguished Mongol soldiers from their peers. The forces under the command of the Mongol Empire were generally trained, organized, and equipped for mobility and speed. To maximize mobility, Mongol soldiers were relatively lightly armored compared to many of the armies they faced. In addition, soldiers of the Mongol army functioned independently of supply lines, considerably speeding up army movement. Skillful use of couriers enabled these armies to maintain contact with each other and with their higher leaders. Discipline was inculcated in <i>nerge</i> (traditional hunts), as reported by <!--del_lnk--> Juvayni. These hunts were distinct from hunts in other cultures which were the equivalent to small unit actions. Mongol forces would spread out on line, surrounding an entire region and drive all of the game within that area together. The goal was to let none of the animals escape and to slaughter them all.<p>All military campaigns were preceded by careful planning, reconnaissance and gathering of sensitive information relating to the enemy territories and forces. The success, organization and mobility of the Mongol armies permitted them to fight on several fronts at once. All males aged from 15 to 60 and capable of undergoing rigorous training were eligible for conscription into the army, the source of honour in the tribal warrior tradition.<p>Another advantage of the Mongols was their ability to traverse large distances even in debilitatingly cold winters; in particular, frozen rivers led them like highways to large urban conurbations on their banks. In addition to siege engineering, the Mongols were also adept at river-work, crossing the river <!--del_lnk--> Saj&oacute; in spring flood conditions with thirty thousand cavalry in a single night during the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Mohi (April, 1241), defeating the Hungarian king <!--del_lnk--> Bela IV. Similarly, in the attack against the Muslim <!--del_lnk--> Khwarezmshah, a flotilla of barges was used to prevent escape on the river.<p><a id="Law_and_governance" name="Law_and_governance"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Law and governance</span></h3>
      <p>The Mongol Empire was governed by a code of law devised by Genghis, called <i><!--del_lnk--> Yassa</i>, meaning &quot;order&quot; or &quot;decree&quot;. A particular canon of this code was that the nobility shared much of the same hardship as the common man. It also imposed severe penalties &ndash; e.g., the death penalty was decreed if the mounted soldier following another did not pick up something dropped from the mount in front. On the whole, the tight discipline made the Mongol Empire extremely safe and well-run; European travelers were amazed by the organization and strict discipline of the people within the Mongol Empire.<p>Under <i>Yassa</i>, chiefs and generals were selected based on <!--del_lnk--> merit, <!--del_lnk--> religious tolerance was guaranteed, and <!--del_lnk--> thievery and vandalizing of civilian property was strictly forbidden. According to legend, a woman carrying a sack of gold could travel safely from one end of the Empire to another.<p>The empire was governed by a non-democratic <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary-style central assembly, called <!--del_lnk--> Kurultai, in which the Mongol chiefs met with the Great Khan to discuss domestic and foreign policies.<p>Genghis also demonstrated a rather liberal and tolerant attitude to the beliefs of others, and never persecuted people on religious grounds. This proved to be good <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/m/Military_strategy.htm" title="Military strategy" class="augment">military strategy</a>, as when he was at war with <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan" class="augment">Sultan</a> Muhammad of Khwarezm, other Islamic leaders did not join the fight against Genghis &mdash; it was instead seen as a non-holy war between two individuals.<p>Throughout the empire, trade routes and an extensive postal system (<i>yam</i>) were created. Many merchants, messengers and travelers from China, the <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> used the system. Genghis Khan also created a national seal, encouraged the use of a written alphabet in Mongolia, and exempted teachers, lawyers, and artists from <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/t/Tax.htm" title="Tax">taxes</a>, although taxes were heavy on all other subjects of the empire.<p>At the same time, any resistance to Mongol rule was met with massive collective punishment.

      <p>Mongols were highly tolerant of most religions, and typically sponsored several at the same time. At the time of Genghis Khan, virtually every religion had found converts, from <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> to <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Manichaeanism to <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>. To avoid strife, Genghis Khan set up an institution that ensured complete religious freedom, though he himself was a <!--del_lnk--> shamanist. Under his administration, all religious leaders were exempt from taxation, and from public service.<p>Initially there were few formal places of worship, because of the nomadic lifestyle. However, under <!--del_lnk--> &Ouml;gedei, several building projects were undertaken in <!--del_lnk--> Karakorum. Along with palaces, Ogodei built houses of worship for the Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoist">Taoist</a> followers. The dominant religion at that time was <!--del_lnk--> Shamanism, <!--del_lnk--> Tengriism and <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, although Ogodei&#39;s wife was a Christian.

      <p>Ogedei&#39;s son and Guyuk&#39;s younger brother, Khoten (&#x425;&#x4AF;&#x434;&#x44D;&#x43D;, K&ouml;t&ouml;n), became the governor of Ningxia and Gansu. He launched a military campaign into <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> under the command of Generals Lichi and Dhordha. The marauding Mongols burned down Tibetan monuments such as the Reting monastery and the Gyal temple in 1240. Prince K&ouml;t&ouml;n was convinced that no power in the world exceeded the might of the Mongols. However, he believed that religion was necessary in the interests of the next life. Thus he invited Sakya Pandita to Mongolia. Prince K&ouml;t&ouml;n was impressed by Sakya Pandita&#39;s teachings. Then he became the first known <a class="mw-redirect" href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> prince of Mongol empire.<p><!--del_lnk--> Khatun Chabi influenced Kublai to be converted to Buddhism.

On the completion of the second stage, Khubilai offered Phagpa a white dharma conch shell and rule over all the three provinces of Tibet. The third stage of the initiation was followed by Khubilai taking a vow to renounce the yearly mass sacrifices of his Chinese subjects. The sacrifices involved an annual ritual of throwing a large number of Chinese subjects into Lake Miyou to check the growth of the Chinese population in his empire.<p>Scientists says <!--del_lnk--> Hulagu and <!--del_lnk--> Abaqa were buddhists.

      <p>Some <!--del_lnk--> Mongols had been proselytized by Christian <!--del_lnk--> Nestorians since about the 7th century, and a few Mongols were converted to <!--del_lnk--> Catholicism, esp. by <!--del_lnk--> John of Montecorvino.<p>Some of the major Christian figures among the Mongols were: <!--del_lnk--> Sorghaghtani Beki, daughter in law of <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/g/Genghis_Khan.htm" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>, and mother of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Khans <!--del_lnk--> M&ouml;ngke, <!--del_lnk--> Kublai, <!--del_lnk--> Hulagu and <!--del_lnk--> Ariq Boke; <!--del_lnk--> Sartaq, khan of Golden Horde; <!--del_lnk--> Doquz Khatun, the mother of the ruler <!--del_lnk--> Abaqa; <!--del_lnk--> Kitbuqa, general of Mongol forces in the <!--del_lnk--> Levant, who fought in alliance with Christians. Marital alliances with Western powers also occurred, as in the 1265 marriage of <!--del_lnk--> Maria Despina Palaiologina, daughter of Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Michael VIII Palaeologus, with <!--del_lnk--> Abaqa.<p>The 13th century saw attempts at a <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Mongol alliance with exchange of ambassadors and even military collaboration with European Christians in the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Land. The Nestorian Mongol <!--del_lnk--> Rabban Bar Sauma visited some European courts in 1287-1288.

      <p>Mongols employed many Muslims in various fields and increasingly took their advice in administrative affairs. Muslims became a favored class of officials as they were well educated and knew Turkish and Mongolian. Notable Mongol converts to Islam include <!--del_lnk--> Nogai Khan, <!--del_lnk--> Oljeitu, <!--del_lnk--> Tuda Mengu, <!--del_lnk--> Negudar and <!--del_lnk--> Berke who was the first Muslim leader of any the Mongol khanates.<p><!--del_lnk--> Ghazan was the first Muslim khan to adopt Islam as national religion of Ilkhanate followed by <!--del_lnk--> Uzbek who urged his subjects to accept the religion as well. Though in Moghulistan, Mongols continued their nomadic lifestyle as Buddhism and shamanism flourished until the 1350&#39;s. While three out of the four Mongol khanates converted to Islam, Mongol men did not fully prohibit women&#39;s political influence.<p>Though the Yuan Dynasty was the only Khanate not to convert to Islam, there had been many Muslim foreigners since the khans were tolerant of other religions. Contact between Yuan emperors in China and <!--del_lnk--> Papal states and other Muslim states lasted until the mid-14th century. But Chingisid princes maintained contact with Muslims in Central Asia and Northwestern China so long during the post imperial period. According to <!--del_lnk--> Jack Weatherford, there were more than one million Muslims in Yuan Dynasty.<p><a id="Tengerism_.28Shamanism.29" name="Tengerism_.28Shamanism.29"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Tengerism (Shamanism)</span></h4>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Shamans which practics a form of <!--del_lnk--> animism with several meaning and with different characters, was popular religion in Ancient Central asia and <!--del_lnk--> Siberia. The central in the raltionship between humen and nature will be the worship of the Blue Mighty Eternal Heaven - &quot;Blue Sky&quot; (&#x425;&#x4E9;&#x445; &#x442;&#x44D;&#x43D;&#x433;&#x44D;&#x440;, &#x42D;&#x440;&#x445;&#x44D;&#x442; &#x43C;&#x4E9;&#x43D;&#x445; &#x442;&#x44D;&#x43D;&#x433;&#x44D;&#x440;). There are a total of 99 Tengris (sky-spirits) or Heavenly creatures in the lower and upper world. In which K&ouml;ke M&ouml;ngke Tengri (Eternal Blue Heaven) is the higest. He is the creator of the visible and invisible world. In the Asian mythologies it is referred to such as a monotheistic world with multiple Gods (Tengris, Burkhans and Lords). The next to K&ouml;ke M&ouml;ngke Tengri is the Qurmusata King.<p>There were famous shamans in Mongol Empire such as Teb tengri and Khorchi. And Most of early Great khagans except Kublai and khans of Golden Horde and Chagatai Khanate such as <!--del_lnk--> Batu, <!--del_lnk--> Tokhta, <!--del_lnk--> Chagatai, <!--del_lnk--> Duwa and <!--del_lnk--> Kebek were shamanists.<p>While Ghazan converted to Islam, he still practiced some elements of Mongol Shamanism. The <!--del_lnk--> Yassa code remained in place and Mongol Shamans were allowed to remain in the Ilkhanate empire and remained politically influential throughout his reign as well as <!--del_lnk--> Oljeitu&#39;s. However ancient Mongol shamanistic traditions went into decline with the demise of Oljeitu and with the rise of rulers practicing a purified form of Islam.<p><a id="Trade_networks" name="Trade_networks"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Trade networks</span></h3>
      <p>Mongols prized their commercial and trade relationships with neighboring economies and this policy they continued during the process of their conquests and during the expansion of their empire. All merchants and ambassadors, having proper documentation and authorization, traveling through their realms were protected. This greatly increased overland trade.<p>During the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, European merchants, numbering hundreds, perhaps thousands, made their way from Europe to the distant land of China &mdash; <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/m/Marco_Polo.htm" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a> is only one of the best known of these.

      <p>The Mongol Empire had an ingenious and efficient mail system for the time, often referred to by scholars as the <!--del_lnk--> Yam, which had lavishly furnished and well guarded relay posts known as <i>&ouml;rt&ouml;&ouml;</i> set up all over the Mongol Empire.

A messenger would typically travel 25&nbsp;miles (40&nbsp;km) from one ordu to the next, and he would either receive a fresh, rested horse or relay the mail to the next rider to ensure the speediest possible delivery.

      <p>At first, the Mongol Empire was ruled by <!--del_lnk--> &Ouml;gedei Khan, Genghis Khan&#39;s third son and designated heir, but after his death in 1241, the fractures which would ultimately crack the Empire began to show. Enmity between the grandchildren of Genghis Khan resulted in a five year regency by &Ouml;gedei&#39;s widow until she finally got her son <!--del_lnk--> Guyuk Khan confirmed as Great Khan. But he only ruled two years, and following his death -- he was on his way to confront his cousin Batu Khan, who had never accepted his authority -- another regency followed, until finally a period of stability came with the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Mongke Khan, from 1251-1259. The last universally accepted Great Khan was his brother <!--del_lnk--> Arigboh (aka. Arigbuga, or Arigbuha), his elder brother <!--del_lnk--> Kublai Khan dethroned him with his own supporters after some extensive battles. <!--del_lnk--> Kublai Khan ruled from 1260-1294. Despite his recognition as Great Khan, he was unable to keep his brother <!--del_lnk--> Hulagu and their cousin <!--del_lnk--> Berke from open warfare in 1263, and after Kublai&#39;s death there was not an accepted Great Khan, so the Mongol Empire was fragmented for good.<p>Genghis Khan divided his realm into four <!--del_lnk--> Khanates, subdivisions of a single empire under the <!--del_lnk--> Great Khan (<!--del_lnk--> Khan of Khans). The following <!--del_lnk--> Khanates emerged after the regency following &Ouml;gedei Khan&#39;s death, and became formally independent after <!--del_lnk--> Kublai Khan&#39;s death:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Blue Horde (under <!--del_lnk--> Batu Khan) and <!--del_lnk--> White Horde (under <!--del_lnk--> Orda Khan) would soon be combined into the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Horde, with Batu Khan emerging as Khan.<li><!--del_lnk--> Il-Khanate - <!--del_lnk--> Hulegu Khan<li>Empire of the Great Khan (<a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>) - <!--del_lnk--> Kublai Khan<li><!--del_lnk--> Mongol homeland (present day <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, including <!--del_lnk--> Kharakhorum) - <!--del_lnk--> Tolui Khan<li><!--del_lnk--> Chagatai Khanate - <!--del_lnk--> Chagatai Khan</ul>

      <p>The empire&#39;s expansion continued for a generation or more after Genghis&#39;s death in 1227. Under Genghis&#39;s successor <!--del_lnk--> &Ouml;gedei Khan, the speed of expansion reached its peak. Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the Xia and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, and came into conflict with the <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/s/Song_Dynasty.htm" title="Song Dynasty">Song Dynasty</a> of China, starting a war that concluded in 1279 with the conquest of populous China, which then constituted the majority of the world&#39;s economic production.<p>In the late 1230s, the Mongols under <!--del_lnk--> Batu Khan <!--del_lnk--> invaded Russia and <!--del_lnk--> Volga Bulgaria, reducing most of its principalities to vassalage, and pressed on into Eastern Europe. In 1241 the Mongols may have been ready to invade Western Europe as well, having defeated the last Polish-German and Hungarian armies at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Legnica and the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Mohi. Batu Khan and Subutai were preparing to start with a winter campaign against Austria and <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany" class="augment">Germany</a>, and finish with Italy. However news of &Ouml;gedei&#39;s death spared Western Europe as Batu had to turn his attentions to the election of the next Great Khan. It is often speculated that this was one of the great turning points in history and that <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> may well have fallen to the Mongols had the invasion gone ahead. During the 1250s, Genghis&#39;s grandson <!--del_lnk--> Hulegu Khan, operating from the Mongol base in Persia, destroyed the <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasid Caliphate</a> in <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> and destroyed the <!--del_lnk--> cult of the Assassins, moving into Palestine towards <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. The Great Khan <!--del_lnk--> M&ouml;ngke having died, however, he hastened to return for the election, and the force that remained in Palestine was destroyed by the <!--del_lnk--> Mamluks under <!--del_lnk--> Saif ad-Din Qutuz in 1261 at <!--del_lnk--> Ayn Jalut.<div align="center">

      <p>Essentially, only five areas accessible to the Mongols avoided conquest by them -- Indochina, South Asia, Japan, Western Europe and Arabia. Also, two important cities that evaded the Mongol Conquest were Vienna and <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem" class="augment">Jerusalem</a>.

      <p>While the Mongolian Empire extended into Poland and threatening present day Austria, the Mongols were not able to push into Western Europe. The most popular explanation was the fact that on 11 December 1241, during pre-emptive operations by Mongol reconnaissance forces inside Austria for the <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/i/Invasion.htm" title="Invasion">invasion</a> of <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, news came that <!--del_lnk--> Ogedei Khan died, and bound by Mongol tradition, all Mongol commanders and princes had to report back to the capital of <!--del_lnk--> Karakorum to elect a new Khan. It was believed that the Mongol abandonment of the European campaign was only temporary, but in fact, the Mongols had committed no further campaigns into Europe in earnest. Some western historians attribute European survival to Mongol unwillingness to fight in the more densely populated German principalities, where the wetter weather affected their bows. But the same weather did not stop them from devastating Russia or the campaigns against the Southern Song, and Europe was less densely populated than China.<p>The probable answer for the Mongol&#39;s stopping after the Mohi River, and the destruction of the Hungarian army, was that they never intended to advance further at that time.<p>Batu Khan had made his Russian conquests safe for the next 10 generations, and when the Great Khan died, he rushed back to Mongolia to put in his claim for power. Upon his return, relations with his cousin Guyuk Khan had deteriorated to the point that open warfare between them came shortly after Guyuk&#39;s death. The point is that the Mongols were unable to bring a unified army to bear on either Europe, or Egypt, after 1260. Batu Khan was in fact planning invasion of Europe all the way to the &quot;Great Sea&quot; &mdash; the <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, when he died in 1255.<p>His son inherited the Khanate, but also died in a short time, and Batu&#39;s brother <!--del_lnk--> Berke became Khan of the <!--del_lnk--> Kipchak Khanate.

In both Japan and Vietnam, Kublai sent part of the Mongol armies, instead of concentrating on Vietnam first, and then Japan. Furthermore, the splitting of resources left the Mongols with a fleet that was not readily equipped for the storms that plagued the <!--del_lnk--> Sea of Japan. <!--del_lnk--> A great storm sank the primary invasion fleet and killed most of the Mongol army during the 1281 invasion.<p><a id="Southeast_Asia" name="Southeast_Asia"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Southeast Asia</span></h3>

      <p>Many other kingdoms in Indochina could counter the Mongol invasion, such as the Maoluang Kingdom (or Kingdom of Mong Mao) in Northern <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand" class="augment">Thailand</a>, Shan and Kachin in today&#39;s Northern and Northeastern Myanmar as well as <!--del_lnk--> Assam in Eastern India and Southwestern China. Sa Khaan Pha (or Si Ke Fa), king of Maoluang Kingdom, was able to negotiate a treaty after he defeated the Mongols three times during the period of Kublai Khan. He received authority over the land south of the Sang city which is now Kunming in the Yunnan province of China. Mongol-led Yuan forces attacked <!--del_lnk--> Champa in <!--del_lnk--> Southern Vietnam with large scale of army once in 1287. Lanna and Sibsongpanna (in present Northern Thailand, Northern Laos and Southern China), Lan Xang (in present Laos), the Siamese kingdoms of Chiang Saen (or Chieng Saeng), Lavo, Haripunjai, Phyao and Sukhotai never invaded by the Mongols due to the rough terrain. However, the Burmese Pagan dynasty was destroyed in 1287 by Kublai Khan as well as the Northern Vietnamese empire of Viet. <!--del_lnk--> Sodu sent also 100 Mongols to raid on <!--del_lnk--> Khmer Empire while he was fighting with <!--del_lnk--> Champa.

      <p>South Asia was also able to withstand the advance of the Mongols. At this time, Northern India was under the rule of the Delhi sultanate. Though the Mongols raided into the Punjab and besieged Delhi itself (unsuccessfully), the Sultans--mostly notably Ghiyasuddin <!--del_lnk--> Balban--were able to keep them at bay and roll them back. Historian John Keay credited the successful combination of the Indian elephant phalanx and maneuverable central Asian cavalry operated by the rulers of Northern India. Ironically, 300 years later, Babar, a Timurid scion who claimed descent from Genghis Khan, would go on to conquer northern India and found the Mughal Empire.<p><a id="Arabia_and_Egypt" name="Arabia_and_Egypt"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Arabia and Egypt</span></h3>
      <p>The final area which would withstand the Mongols was the Levant. The <!--del_lnk--> Mamluks successfully defended the Holy Land with the aid of Berke Khan who allied himself with them after his cousin enraged him by <!--del_lnk--> sacking Baghdad, (Berke was a Muslim, and sent word to the Great Khan that he would &quot;call him to account (<!--del_lnk--> Hulagu Khan), for he has murdered the Caliph in Baghdad, and killed all the faithful.&quot;) This Mongol against Mongol fighting, after the Mamluks defeated the Mongols at <!--del_lnk--> Ain Jalut in 1260 ultimately brought down the Mongol Empire. Mamluks also repelled Mongol attacks in Syria in 1271, 1281, 1299/1300, 1303/1304 and 1312.<p><a id="Disintegration" name="Disintegration"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Disintegration</span></h2>
      <p>When Genghis Khan died, a major potential weakness of the system he had set up manifested itself. It took many months to summon the <i>kurultai</i>, as many of its most important members were leading military campaigns thousands of miles from the Mongol heartland. And then it took months more for the <i>kurultai</i> to come to the decision that had been almost inevitable from the start &mdash; that Genghis&#39;s choice as successor, his third son &Ouml;gedei, should become Great Khan. &Ouml;gedei was a rather passive ruler and personally self-indulgent, but he was intelligent, charming and a good decision-maker whose authority was respected throughout his reign by apparently stronger-willed relatives and generals whom he had inherited from Genghis.<p>After the initial massive campaigns at the beginning of the conquest of Europe, where the Mongol war machine handily defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Hungarian and <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Polish</a> armies, the <!--del_lnk--> Hospitallers, the <!--del_lnk--> Teutonic Knights, as well as the slaughtering of countless many civilians, &Ouml;gedei Khan suddenly died in 1241; just as the Mongol forces under General <!--del_lnk--> Subutai were preparing an all out assault on <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>. This sudden <!--del_lnk--> vacuum of power is seen as the beginning of the events that led to the decline of the Mongol Empire. As customary to Mongol military tradition, all generals and princes, and thus the tumens, had to report back to the capital Karakorum thousands of miles away (the relocation of the capital to <!--del_lnk--> Dadu would add to this difficulty under Kublai Khan), for the election of a successor to the throne. Pending a <i>kurultai</i> to elect &Ouml;gedei&#39;s successor, his widow Toregene Khatun assumed power and proceeded to ensure the election of her son <!--del_lnk--> Guyuk by the <i>kurultai</i>. Batu, bitterly disappointed by the postponement of the European campaign, was unwilling to accept Guyuk as Great Khan, but lacked the influence in the <i>kurultai</i> to procure his own election. Therefore, while moving no further west, he simultaneously insisted that the situation in Europe was too precarious for him to come east and that he could not accept the result of any <i>kurultai</i> held in his absence. The resulting stalemate lasted four years. In 1246 Batu eventually agreed to send a representative to the <i>kurultai</i> but never acknowledged the resulting election of Guyuk as Great Khan. Toregene Khatun and Guyuk were also less in favour of the <!--del_lnk--> Mandarin officials installed by Genghis Khan himself, most notably Chancellor <!--del_lnk--> Yeh-Lu Ch&#39;u-Ts&#39;ai, who were so instrumental in the successful administration of Mongol conquests, choosing instead, to place <!--del_lnk--> Muslim administrators from the new domains to help run Mongol politics.<p>Guyuk died in 1248, only two years after his election, on his way west, apparently to force Batu to acknowledge his authority, and his widow Oghul Ghaymish assumed the regency pending the meeting of the <i>kurultai</i>; unfortunately for her, she could not keep the power. Batu remained in the west but this time gave his support to his and Guyuk&#39;s cousin, <!--del_lnk--> M&ouml;ngke, who was duly elected Great Khan in 1251.<p>M&ouml;ngke Khan assigned his brother <!--del_lnk--> Kublai, or Qubilai, to a province in North China, which would unwittingly provide Kublai with a chance to become Khan in 1260 shortly after M&ouml;ngke&#39;s death in 1259.<p>Kublai expanded the Mongol Empire and became a favorite of M&ouml;ngke. Kublai&#39;s conquest of China is estimated by Holworth, based on census figures, to have killed over 18 million people. As pointed out by Rummel, these figures are probably highly exaggerated, although a large number of people died in the course of the conquest.<p>Later, though, when Kublai began to adopt many <!--del_lnk--> Chinese laws and customs, his brother was persuaded by his advisors that Kublai was becoming too <!--del_lnk--> sinicized and would be considered treasonous. M&ouml;ngke kept a closer watch on Kublai from then on but died campaigning against <a class="mw-redirect" href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/s/Song_Dynasty.htm" title="Southern Song">Southern Song</a> China at the <!--del_lnk--> Fishing Town in <!--del_lnk--> Chongqing. After his older brother&#39;s death, Kublai placed himself in the running for a new khan against his younger brother, and, although his younger brother won the election, Kublai defeated him in battle, and Kublai became the last Great Khan. Note, among historians there is no consensus who was the last true Great Khan. Many scholars believe that M&ouml;ngke was the last, because after his death, the great empire fell apart into 4 khanates.<p>He proved to be a strong warrior, but his critics still accused him of being too closely tied to <!--del_lnk--> Chinese culture. When he moved his headquarters to <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, there was an uprising in the old capital that he barely staunched. He focused mostly on foreign alliances, and opened trade routes. He dined with a large court every day, and met with many ambassadors, foreign merchants, and even offered to convert to Christianity if this religion was proved to be correct by 100 priests.<p>By the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Kublai Khan, the empire was already in the process of splitting into a number of smaller <!--del_lnk--> khanates. After Kublai died in 1294, his heirs failed to maintain the <!--del_lnk--> Pax Mongolica effective. Inter-family rivalry compounded by the complicated politics of succession, which twice paralyzed military operations as far off as Hungary and the borders of Egypt (crippling their chances of success), and the tendencies of some of the khans to drink themselves to death fairly young (causing the aforementioned succession crises), hastened the disintegration of the empire.<p>Another factor which contributed to the disintegration was the difficulty of the potential two-weeks extra transit time of officials and messengers and a general decline of morale when the capital was moved from <!--del_lnk--> Karakorum to Dadu, the <!--del_lnk--> Yuan name for the modern day city of <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Kublai Khan; as <!--del_lnk--> Kublai Khan associated more closely to <!--del_lnk--> Chinese culture.

The conflict between Kublai Khan and the khanates in Central Asia led by <!--del_lnk--> Kaidu (Qaidu) had lasted for a few decades, until the beginning of the 14th century, when both of them had died. Of the Ilkhanate, their ruler <!--del_lnk--> Ilkhan Ghazan was converted to <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> in 1295 and renounced all allegiance to the Great Khan. He actively supported the expansion of this religion in his empire. The Mongol Empire was never again under one rule, though the other three khanates negotiated peace with <!--del_lnk--> Tem&uuml;r Khan of <!--del_lnk--> Yuan Dynasty and acknowledged him as their nominal overlord in 1304, in order to maintain trade and diplomatic relations.

In 1347, the <!--del_lnk--> Genoese possession of <!--del_lnk--> Caffa, a great trade emporium on the <!--del_lnk--> Crimean peninsula, came under siege by an army of <!--del_lnk--> Mongol warriors under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Janibeg. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army was reportedly withering from the disease, they decided to use the infected corpses as a <!--del_lnk--> biological weapon. The corpses were catapulted over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, transferring the plague via their ships into the south of Europe, whence it rapidly spread. The total number of deaths worldwide from the pandemic is estimated at 75 million people, there were an estimated 20 million deaths in Europe alone. It is estimated that between one-quarter and two-thirds of the of <!--del_lnk--> Europe&#39;s population died from the outbreak of the plague between 1348 and 1350.<li>Among the Western accounts, <!--del_lnk--> R. J. Rummel estimated that 30 million people were killed under the rule of the Mongol Empire.

David Nicole states in <i>The Mongol Warlords</i>, &quot;terror and mass extermination of anyone opposing them was a well tested Mongol tactic.&quot; About half of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian population died during the <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/i/Invasion.htm" title="Invasion">invasion</a>.

In the <!--del_lnk--> invasion of <!--del_lnk--> Kievan Rus&#39;, almost all major cities were destroyed. If they chose to submit, the people were spared and treated as <!--del_lnk--> slaves, which meant most of them would be driven to die quickly by hard work, with the exception that war prisoners became part of their army to aid in future conquests. In addition to intimidation tactics, the rapid expansion of the Empire was facilitated by <!--del_lnk--> military hardiness (especially during bitterly cold winters), military skill, <!--del_lnk--> meritocracy, and discipline. <!--del_lnk--> Subutai, in particular among the Mongol Commanders, viewed winter as the best time for war &mdash; while less hardy people hid from the elements, the Mongols were able to use frozen lakes and rivers as highways for their horsemen, a strategy he used with great effect in <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>.<p>The Mongol Empire had a lasting impact, unifying large regions, some of which (such as eastern and western <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and the western parts of China) remain unified today, albeit under different rulership. The Mongols themselves were assimilated into local populations after the fall of the empire, and many of these descendants adopted local <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religions</a> &mdash; for example, the eastern <!--del_lnk--> Khanates largely adopted <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and the western <!--del_lnk--> Khanates adopted <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, largely under <!--del_lnk--> Sufi influence.

The paper suggests that the pattern of variation within the lineage is consistent with a hypothesis that it originated in Mongolia about 1,000 years ago. Such a spread would be too rapid to have occurred by <!--del_lnk--> diffusion, and must therefore be the result of <!--del_lnk--> selection. The authors propose that the lineage is carried by likely male line descendants of Genghis Khan, and that it has spread through social selection.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In addition to the <!--del_lnk--> Khanates and other descendants, the <!--del_lnk--> Mughal royal family of <!--del_lnk--> South Asia are also descended from Genghis Khan: <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/b/Babur.htm" title="Babur">Babur</a>&#39;s mother was a descendant &mdash; whereas his father was directly descended from <!--del_lnk--> Timur (Tamerlane). At the time of Genghis Khan&#39;s death in 1227, the empire was divided among his four sons, with his third son as the supreme Khan, and by the 1350s, the khanates were in a state of fracture and had lost the order brought to them by Genghis Khan. Eventually the separate khanates drifted away from each other, becoming the Il-Khans Dynasty based in Iran, the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, the <!--del_lnk--> Yuan Dynasty in <a href="/web/20160611142421/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, and what would become the Golden Horde in present day Russia.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire&quot;</div>

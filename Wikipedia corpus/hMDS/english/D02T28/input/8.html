    size="3">The first two assemblies of colonists who had come to Texas at the invitation of
    the liberal principles of republicanism established by the Republic of Mexico under the
    Constitution of 1824 were organized as a mechanism of explanation of concern and the cause
    of unrest among the settlements. Ironically, the colonists were in support of future
    centralista dictator, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who had taken up the cause of
    republicanism and restoration of the principles of 1824. Times prior to the convention
    were cause for optimism since </font>the xenophobic and racist Bustamente's military
    leader had left the State and General Mexia had confirmed to Santa Anna the loyalty of the
    colonists. </p>
    <p align="justify">The call for this convention was issued September 14, 1832 by Horatio
    Chriesman, the first Alcalde of San Felipe and John Austin, the second Alcalde of
    Brazoria. Fifty-six elected delegates from the municipalities presented credentials and
    took seats. Stephen F. Austin was elected president, defeating William Wharton and Francis
    W. Johnson was elected secretary. Wharton was appointed chair of the committee to prepare
    the memorials to the government reflecting proceedings of the meetings. Representatives
    from San Antonio declined participation and no representatives from La Bahia were present
    during the main meeting, but appeared toward the end at which time Rafael Manchola was
    elected to be among the representatives to communicate proceedings of the meeting to
    government officials.</p>

        align="justify">San Felipe de Austin, October 4, 1832 To the Federal Congress of Mexico:</p>
        <p align="justify">Your memorialists, representatives of all the Anglo-Americans of Texas,
        in General Convention, met, taking, advantage of that sacred Republican privilege of
        making known their wants and grievances, which is guaranteed them by the constitution of
        their adopted country, respectfully represent that they have viewed, and still view with
        sentiments of deepest regret and mortification, the passage and present existence of the
        eleventh article of the law of the sixth of April, 1830. This law is obnoxious to your
        memorialists, for many reasons independent of its withering influence on all the hopes of
        Texas, it implies a suspicion of our fidelity to the Mexican constitution. Such suspicion
        we humbly conceive to be utterly unwarranted; and we will endeavor to prove it so, by
        making a review of our conduct from the passage of the first colonization law up to the
        present time.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the year 1823, the Congress of the Mexican nation invited the
        citizens of the United States of the north to become inhabitants of Texas, giving to each
        family one sitio of land for so doing. This donation of land sounds large at a distance.
        Considering, however, the difficulties with which the taking possession of it is
        envisioned, it will not be thought so munificent a bounty, nor so entire a gratuity. Had
        these lands been previously pioneered by the enterprise of government, and freed from the
        insecurities which beset a wilderness trod upon by savages; had they been in the heart of
        an inhabited region, and accessible to the comforts and necessaries of life; had the
        government been deriving an actual revenue from them; could it have realized a capital
        from the sale of them, then we admit the donation would have been unexampled in the
        history of national liberality. But how different from all this was the real state of the
        case. The lands in question were situated in a wilderness of which the government had
        never taken possession. They were not sufficiently explored to obtain that knowledge of
        their character and situation, which would be necessary to a sale of them; they were in
        the occupancy of savages; they were shut out from all commercial intercourse with the
        world and inaccessible to the commonest comforts of life; nor were they brought into
        possession and cultivation without much toil and privation, patience and enterprise, loss
        of lives from Indian hostilities and other causes. Under the smiles of a beneficent
        Heaven, however-r, the untiring perseverence of the immigrants triumphed over all natural
        obstacles; it reduced the forest to cultivation-, made the desert smile, established
        commercial intercourse with the rest of the world, and expelled the savages, by whom the
        country was infested.</p>
        <p align="justify">From this, it must appear, that the lands of Texas, although nominally
        given, were in fact really and dearly bought. It may be here premised that a gift of land
        by a nation to foreigners, on conditions of their becoming citizens, is immensely
        different from a gift or sale from one individual, to another. In the case of individuals,
        the donor or seller loses all further claim upon the lands parted with; but in this case,
        the government only gave wild lands, that they might be redeemed from a state of nature;
        that the obstacles to a first settlement might be overcome, and. that they might be placed
        in a situation to augment the physical strength, power and revenue of the nation. Is it
        not obvious that Mexico now holds the same jurisdiction over the colonized lands of Texas,
        that all nations hold over nineteen-twentieths of their territory? For the first six or
        seven years after the commencement of our settlements in Texas, we gratefully admit that
        our enterprise was animated, and our hardship,, alleviated by the liberality and kindness
        of the Mexican Government. We insist, however, that this beneficent disposition of the
        government was followed by gratitude and loyalty on our part.</p>
        <p align="justify">The only portion of our conduct during this period that could be
        tortured into anything like disloyalty, was the Fredonian disturbance in Nacogdoches in
        1826. And, when it is considered by whom these disturbances were originated and by whom
        quieted, instead of exciting the suspicion of the government, we respectfully conceive
        that the transaction should have confirmed its confidence in our patriotism. The
        disturbances alluded to originated with some fifteen or twenty infatuated individuals. The
        great mass of the settlers were opposed to their mad design, which opposition they
        testified by capturing the conspirators and putting them in custody, before the arrival of
        a single Mexican soldier. Was there anything in this calculated to awaken the suspicions
        of the government? Bad and desperate men there will always be found in every community.
        There will always likewise be a portion capable of being easily misled, and it is not
        really a matter of astonishment that, in this instance, the bad, the desperate, the
        dissatisfied and the misguided are limited to so insignificant a number?</p>
        <p align="justify">Excepting this disturbance, which was opposed by ninety-nine hundredths
        of the settlers and which was quieted by their zeal and patriotism, we repeat it: that up
        to the passage of the law of April 6, 1830, our conduct was orderly and patriotic. The
        passage of this law was a mortifying and melancholy occurrence for Texas. It was
        mortifying to us, for it blasted all our hopes, and was enough to dishearten all our
        enterprise. It was peculiarly mortifying because it admitted into Texas all other nations
        except our friends and countrymen of the United States of the north-except the fathers and
        brothers of many of us, for whom we had emigrated to prepare comfortable homes, and whose
        presence to gladden our firesides we were hourly anticipating. Yes, this law closed the
        door of immigration on the only sister republic worthy of the name, which Mexicans can
        boast of in this new world. It closed the door on a people among whom the knowledge and
        foundations of national liberty are more deeply laid than any other on the habitable
        globe. It closed the door upon a people who have brought with them to Texas those ideals
        of Republican government in which from birth they had been educated and practiced. In
        short, it closed the door upon a people who generously and heroically aided Mexico in her
        revolutionary struggle, and who were the first and foremost to recognize and rejoice at
        the obtainment of her independence.</p>
        <p align="justify">Is it for a moment to be supposed that the European parasites of power,
        to whom now alone the door of immigration is left open-that those who have been taught
        from infancy to believe in the natural inequality of mankind; who have been unacquainted
        with constitutions even in name; who, politically speaking, have never been accustomed to
        think or legislate for themselves; who reverence the arm of monarchial rule; who pay
        adulation at the feet of an hereditary nobility and who have contemplated republics only
        in theory and at a distance---is it, we repeat, to be supposed that immigrants of this
        description will contribute more to the advancement of liberty and the welfare of the
        Republic than immigrants from that land of liberal sentiments, that cradle of freedom,
        that mother of constitutional heroes---the United States of the north? If such be the
        fact, habit and education must go for nothing---and all experience is set at naught and a
        contradiction.</p>
        <p align="justify">Your memorialists having, as they trust and respectfully conceive,
        shown to your honorable bodies that their conduct up to the time of the passage of the law
        of April 6, 1830, was orderly and patriotic, will now turn your attention to their conduct
        since that period. This law was sufficient to goad us on to madness, in as much as it
        blasted all our hopes and defeated all our calculations; inasmuch as it showed to us that
        we were to remain scattered, isolated and unhappy tenants of the wilderness of Texas,
        compelled to gaze upon the resources of a lovely and fertile region undeveloped for want
        of a population, and cut off front the society of fathers and friends in the United States
        of the north; to prepare homes and comforts suited to whose age and infirmities many of us
        had patiently submitted to every species of privation. But what was our conduct'? As
        peaceful citizens we submitted. The wheels of government were not retarded in their
        operation by us. Not a voice nor an arm was uplifted. We had confidence in the correct
        intentions of the government: and we believed and hoped that when the momentary excitement
        of tile day had subsided, a returning sense of justice and liberality would give this law
        a brief duration. For more than two years we have remained in this peaceful, this
        unmurmuring attitude. In this time the heroic and patriotic General Santa Anna arose as
        the vindicator of liberty and the constitution. We had confidence in the purity of his
        motives. We believed that the evils which he battled to redress were of an alarming and
        crying magnitude, of no less magnitude than all utter disregard of the constitution, on
        the part of the vice-president and his ministers. With General Santa Anna we united as
        fellow-laborers in the same sacred cause, preferring rather to perish in defense of the
        violated charter of our rights than to live in acquiescence with acts of arbitrary and
        unconstitutional power. What we have done in this matter is known to the government and to
        tile world. It was all in defense of the rights, liberties and guaranties that were
        spurned and trampled upon.</p>
        <p align="justify">Here we would ask, what was there in all this to induce suspicion of
        our disloyalty to the constitution? Was it in our remaining quiet for more than two years
        after the passage of the law of the 6th of April? Was it in declaring for the constitution
        and hazarding all we held dear in its defense! Would it not have been easy to have taken
        advantage of the troubles in the interior and to have declared and battled for
        independence? Was there ever a time more opportune and inviting? Why did we not then
        declare for independence. Because in the holiest sincerity of our hearts, we assure you,
        and we call Almighty God to witness the truth of the assertion, we did not then, and we do
        not now, wish for independence. NO! There is not all Anglo-American in Texas whose heart
        does not beat high for the prosperity of the Mexican Republic: who does not cordially and
        devoutly wish that all parts of her territory may remain united to the end of time, that
        she may steadily and rapidly advance in arts, arms, agriculture, commerce, manufactures,
        and in learning; virtue, freedom and all that can add to the splendor and happiness of a
        great nation. As all evidence that we wished not for independence nor for coalescence with
        the United States of the north, your memorialists would respectfully refer your honorable
        bodies to the following fact, viz: A short while since it was rumored among us that the
        President of the United States of the north exposed a determination to make the Neches
        River, instead of the Sabine, the line between the two republics. This hitherto unheard of
        claim provoked the indignation of every inhabitant of Texas, and our constituents have,
        with one voice, called upon us to memorialize your honorable bodies on the, subject of the
        injustice of such a demand. May it please,our honorable bodies, your memorialists trust
        that they have conclusively shown that the whole tenor of their conduct has been
        characterized by good order and patriotism.</p>
        <p align="justify">The destructive influence of the law of the 6th of April, 1830, upon
        the prospects of Texas, has only been incidentally alluded to, the effect of that law
        being too obvious to require expatiation or argument. The law is likewise as injurious to
        the national revenue at large, as to us individually, for it is evident that the
        greatness, the power, the wealth and independence of a nation, depend upon a proper
        development of its resources. Can the resources of Texas be properly developed with this
        law hanging over it? We believe not. We believe under such circumstances it would remain
        the comparative wilderness it now is. Experience shows that native Mexican-, will not
        settle in it; but should they do so it would not augment the physical force of the nation,
        for it would only be taking population from one part of the Republic to place them in
        another. Will Europeans settle? We believe Europeans of the right description, to benefit
        the country, will not, for many reasons. Our hopes, then, for the development of the
        resources of Texas are naturally turned to the United States of the north, to a people who
        have been trained in the school of Republicanism, whose physical constitutions are adapted
        to the climate and who have been brought up to the cultivation of such articles as will
        always be the staples of Texas. Against them alone, however, the door is closed, which we
        contend is equally injurious to its and to the national revenue. Another point of view, in
        which the law of the 6th of April is objectionable, and has been productive of numberless
        difficulties, is this: The garrisons with which all parts of Texas have been lately
        crowded must have grown out of this law and have been sent here to enforce it. They could
        not have been sent here for our protection, for when they came we were able to protect
        ourselves; and at the commencement of the settlements when we were few, weak and scattered
        and defenseless, not a garrison---no, not a soldier-came to our aid. In the presence, and
        vicinity of these garrisons, the civil arm has generally been paralyzed and powerless, for
        many of the officers were law-despisers, who set the political authorities at defiance,
        brought them into contempt and trespassed in every respect upon the rights and privileges
        of their fellow-citizens. When all of these things are considered, we can but believe that
        the former characteristic justice and liberality of your honorable body will return to our
        aid, and bring about an immediate repeal of this, to us, ever to be deprecated measure.</p>
        <p align="justify">That justice, that liberality, we now most respectfully, solemnly,
        unanimously and confidently invoke. WILLIAM WHARTON, Chairman. LUKE LEASSIER, JONAS

    Consultation.</strong></em> The following report of 16 Oct to the Ayuntamiento of Bexar
    summarizes the meeting and was an appeal for support of the residents of Bexar to support
    its goals:</p>
    <p align="justify">Pursuant to a call of the Alcalde of this municipality, a general
    meeting of the inhabitants of Texas, through delegates, took place in this town on the 1st
    inst., fifty-eight delegates being present. The object of the meeting was to make to the
    general Congress an exposition of the situation of Texas. After full deliberation it was
    concluded to represent to the Congress, agreeably to article 2d of the law of May 7th,
    1824, that Texas has the proper requisites to form singly a State separate from Coahuila.
    It was further agreed to claim a reform of the maritime tariff, and the abrogation of
    article 11th of the law of April 6th, 1830, prohibiting the immigration of natives of the
    United States of the north. A request was also made to the government to appoint a
    commissioner for the settlement of land matters, and to establish an Ayuntamiento between
    the San Jacinto and Sabine rivers; also to grant certain lands to the Ayuntamientos of
    Texas, by the sale whereof they might raise the funds needed to erect school houses and
    support schools of the Spanish and English languages. In view of the exposed situation of
    the country to Indian depredations, the convention agreed upon framing a provincial
    regulation for the militia. They also appointed a standing, or central, committee in this
    town and subordinate committees in every section represented in the body. It was made the
    duty of the central committee to correspond with the subordinate committees, inform them
    concerning subjects of general interest, and in case of emergency, to call another general
    meeting or Texas convention. This committee was further instructed to open a
    correspondence with the people of Bexar, and to invite them to cooperate in the
    furtherance of the foregoing objects. The general meeting, under a sense of the high
    importance of the matters discussed and acted upon, agreed upon sending a delegate to
    Saltillo and Mexico, charged with the duty of earnestly urging them upon the consideration
    of the government, and to that end they selected citizen William H. Wharton as their
    representative. It was the earnest wish of the convention that some suitable person,
    either from Bexar or Goliad, should accompany the delegate from this town, and co-operate
    with him in the presentation to the government of the matters confided to his management,
    but they took no step in that direction, not knowing, whether the people of those sections
    would approve of what had been done. But, after the meeting had concluded their business,
    the delegates from Goliad arrived and, having manifested to the committee their hearty
    acquiescence in the conclusions reached by that convention, and expressed the wish of the
    people of Goliad that a delegate should be appointed from their district to accompany
    citizen William H. Wharton on his mission before mentioned, and Don Rafael Manchola having
    been suggested, it was agreed by the committee jointly with the delegates from Goliad that
    he receive the appointment, subject to the concurrence of all the subordinate committees.
    It was also agreed that the expenses of the delegates should be defrayed by means of
    voluntary contributions, and for this purpose the subordinate committees are instructed to
    open subscriptions aggregating the sum of four thousand dollars, out of which each
    delegate shall be paid the sum of two thousand dollars. All the foregoing I communicate to
    your body, by order of the convention, hoping that the people of Bexar will approve the
    measures adopted and proceed to the appointing of a committee in that city, charged with
    the duty of a correspondence with the committee of this town. It is hoped, also, that you
    will approve the appointment of Don Rafael Manchola to proceed to Saltillo and Mexico in
    company with Mr. Wharton for the purposes above stated and that you will acquaint the
    central committee in this town, as soon as possible, with your decision and furnish them
    the names of the members of the committee appointed in your city. So soon as the documents
    embodying the several subjects acted upon by the convention shall have been translated
    into Spanish, copies thereof will be sent to the committee of your city, for the
    information of the public. God and the prosperity of Texas. F. W. JOHNSON, Chairman JAMES

    <p align="justify">The meeting was an open one and results were communicated frankly and
    openly to the Mexican government at all levels. The memorial and the above letter with
    additional proceedings of the meeting was presented to the Ayuntamiento of Bexar hoping
    that their fears and doubts about the purpose of the meeting would ease and they would
    join in the objects of the consultation. Through the next several months the Ayuntamiento
    of Bexar represented by alcalde <a href="government.htm#consul1832"><em><strong>Jose Angel
    Navarro </strong></em>expressed sympathy</a> with the objectives, but doubts of the
    utility of the consultation and its results and failed to overtly support it. Although the
    Municipality of Gonzales was represented actively by Henry Brown and Claiborne Stinnett,
    the Gonzales Ayuntamiento remained <em>&quot;officially&quot;</em> neutral through <a

        American settlements from the Colorado to the Sabine, of which I informed your excellency

        <td width="100%">SAN FELIPE, Nov. 15, 1832<br>
        ESTEEMED FRIEND: I agree with the sentiment expressed in your appreciated letter of the
        8th inst., just received: He is to be pitied who has the misfortune to be at the head of
        public affairs in revolutionary times; but the only safe rule to follow is, to do one's
        duty regardless of the judgment of others. By this rule I have ever aimed to shape my
        actions, and my conscience is at rest. On several occasions I have found myself begirt
        with weighty embarrassments, but to the law of duty just mentioned, as to a polar star, I
        have looked for guidance and my aim has ever been to promote the true interests of the
        nation and of Texas. With regard to the convention of' which you speak, I can assure you
        it did not originate with me, but I am satisfied that some good will result from its
        action. Already the public is better satisfied, and we have bad more quiet than we had
        some time anterior thereto. As to your communication to the Ayuntamiento in relation to
        the convention, I believe that it would have been better not to have written it.
        Revolutionary times are not like peaceable times. Colonel Bradburn could, with the least
        prudence, have avoided all the evils that, like a pall, have for some time mantled the
        country. I tell you candidly, that in my opinion, it would be very impolitic to translate
        and print your communication. I shall not do so. The Ayuntamiento may do as they please.
        In times like the present, any measure is bad that tends to irritate and produce
        excitement; every measure is good that is calculated to soothe, bind up and bring about
        tranquillity and good order. I have but little hope of obtaining anything from the
        Government of Mexico. There is little probability that we shall soon have a stable and
        peaceable order of public affairs; and I give it as my deliberate judgment that Texas is
        lost if she take no measure of her own for her welfare. I incline to the opinion that it
        is your duty, as Chief Magistrate, to call a general convention to take into consideration
        the condition of the Country. I do not know how the State or General Government can
        presume to say that the people of Texas have violated the constitution, when the acts of
        both governments have long since killed the constitution, and when the confederation
        itself has hardly any life left. I cannot approve the assertion that the people have not
        the right to assemble peaceably and calmly and respectfully represent their wants. In
        short, the condition of Texas is bad, but we may fear to see it still worse. I am settling
        up all my affairs, and in April I will go to the north for six months or a year. In Texas
        things present no hopeful aspect, but still when away I shall be glad to be informed how
        matters go on. I hope you will, from time to time, let me hear from you, telling me of
        current events, especially of such things as indicate the vitality or death of the
        constitution; also as to whether or not a presidential election has occurred, and what new
        hope may have sprung up as to an early and peaceful settlement of the affairs of our
        country. In the meanwhile, please command, Your affectionate friend, S.F. AUSTIN.</td>

    for drafting a constitution with independence. Among the latter were those favoring

    <p align="justify"><a name="petition"></a>David B. Edward in <em>The History of Texas</em>
    published in 1836 prints the following two treatises as documents presented to the
    Congress of the Republic of Mexico:</p>
    <div align="center"><center><table border="0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><em><strong>To the Sovereign General Congress of the Republic of Mexico.</strong></em>
        The inhabitants of all Texas, met in General Convention, at the Town of San Felipe de
        Austin, by means of delegates, for the purpose of making known their wants to the
        government, most respectfully represent, that they desire the separation of Texas from
        Coahuila; believing such separation indispensable to their mutual happiness and
        prosperity; and that ultimately, such division would produce the most happy results to the
        Mexican Republic. <p align="justify"><em><strong>Differences in Coahuila and Texas.</strong></em>
        Coahuila being so far distant from the population of Texas, and so widely variant from it
        in interests, the rights and wants of the people of Texas cannot be properly protected and
        provided for, under the present organization, admitting the several Departments of the
        Government of the State to be prompted by the utmost purity of intention, in their efforts
        for the administration of justice. Coahuila and Texas are dissimilar in soil, climate and
        productions, in common interests, and partly in population. The representatives of the
        former are numerous, and those of the latter few; in consequence of which, any law passed
        peculiarly adapted for the benefit of Texas, has only to the effect of a generous
        courtesy. Laws happily constructed for the benefit of Coahuila, and conducive to its best
        interests, might be ruinous to Texas; such are the conflicting interests of the two
        countries, for instance, the unconstitutional law, prohibiting any but native Mexicans
        from retailing merchandise, in those places not inhabited by American colonists-to the
        exclusion of naturalized citizens from participation in that employment. </p>
        <p align="justify"><em><strong>Security and Settlement of Aborigines.</strong></em>
        Another reason, which should interest the sympathies of the Republic, and enlist the aid
        of government, in favor of Texas, is its locality, being adjoining the territory of a
        powerful nation, whose established policy towards the aborigines has a tendency to flood
        Texas with Indian emigrants of a character dangerous in the extreme. The wide extent of
        wilderness, forming a natural boundary between Texas and Coahuila, places an indispensable
        barrier in the way of Coahuila's extending the efficient means of defense she might wish.
        This circumstance alone demands that all the energies of Texas should be embodied, to
        prevent that calamity which threatens this favored country; and which nothing short of a
        well regulated government of a free, unshackled, and independent State can provide
        against. Be it known, therefore, that we, the people of Texas, view with regret and
        concern, the present unfortunate situation of the North American Tribes of Indians
        residing in Texas, and much deplore the transactions which have occasioned it. It is a
        well known fact, that the Cherokees claim by way of grant, a tract of land situated about
        thirty miles to the northwest of Nacogdoches; which claim they have been told, is worth
        about as much as the paper it is written on. The Shawnees also; to say nothing of those
        other tribes, which have settled in the country and have been promised possessions. The
        promise is still protracted. When the Indian (inclined as he is to believe that a promise
        made, eventually must be fulfilled) becomes too frequently the dupe of craftiness and
        oppression, he naturally becomes discontented, unfriendly and hostile; and in the present
        instance might be made more troublesome to as, than those tribes which no concessions will
        mollify! The Indians' repeated request to obtain their rights, are unattended to; because
        an accredited agent of the government has been illegally suspended, by a military officer
        of the last dynasty, who, in continuance of his system of deception and conciliation, and
        with a view to enlist their aid, declared to the Cherokees, (at the time we began to
        evince a disposition of throwing from our necks the insupportable weight of military
        oppression)---<em>&quot;The Americans grasping for land, intend making the attempt of
        driving all my countrymen from this State; and an extirpation of you all will soon
        follow.&quot; </em>But the conflict at an end---we explained to them the true causes which
        impelled us to arms; and they, seeing a large number of our native Mexican fellow citizens
        had taken up arms in our behalf, seemingly became convinced, that we fought for justice to
        ourselves, and with respect for the rights of every Indian. However, unfortunately---just
        at this time, and while they were being told, the Government would put them in possession
        of their lands,-some of our fellow citizens, without authority, ran off, and concluded in
        a survey, part of the Cherokee claim or grant; consequently creating, by such an act, a
        distrustful disposition on the part of those Indians - in conjunction with all those
        unlawful acts, so repeatedly committed on the poor confiding Indians of Texas, who are
        thus made to believe that we are actuated by the same spirit as their former oppressors.
        Therefore, do they credit any gross misrepresentation made to them, giving to former
        apprehensions the guise of truth; and they are now losing past confidence, in all
        individual protestations or advice, like the wrecked bark, which having crossed a wide
        expanse of ocean, is in sight of her destined port, but without the friendly sails that
        propelled her, and without any visible aid or probable chance of assistance! Under these
        Indian circumstances alone, we most respectfully solicit and entreat your most Honorable
        Body, to consider that as a state, we would be enabled to take such active measures in
        their behalf, as would convince them, that they could not with impunity be unlawfully or
        unjustly intruded upon; humbly trusting, that we could do such justice to their wishes in
        relation to lands, as could not fail to assure them of our friendship and protection;
        ---besides, enlisting those North American Tribes of Indians among us, in favor of the
        state and general Government, by securing to them a permanence of situation, and enrolling
        them as brother-citizens of that confederacy, which they so much respect and regard! </p>
        <p align="justify"><em><strong>Rights for Independent State under Constitution of 1824</strong></em>.
        For the above reasons and many others, which the General Congress will readily conceive,
        and in view of the decree of the 7th of May, 1824, allowing the people of Texas, so soon
        as their situation would permit, to appear as a distinct state, to report to Congress for
        their resolution, ---also, in connection with the 11th section of the Federal
        Constitution, guaranteeing them a representative in Congress, whatever may be their
        population; and considering duly, the benefits that would result, both to Texas and to the
        nation, we entertain no doubts of the favorable reception of this petition. The people of
        Texas present the strongest assurances of their patriotic attachment to the Constitution,
        and to the Republic pledging all and every interest in life, for the support of their
        declaration!</p>
        <p align="justify"><em><strong>Tariff Relief. </strong>To the General Congress.<strong> </strong></em>The
        inhabitants of Texas, and so forth, ---respectfully represent, that the duties on articles
        of necessity to the inhabitants, which are not and cannot be manufactured in Texas for
        several years to come, are so high as to be equivalent to a total prohibition: that many
        other articles which are prohibited by the Tariff, are of the first necessity to the
        settlers of Texas. Arid as the people, of this section of the Republic, are yet almost
        without resources, and are generally farmers who make their support by cultivating the
        land, and have no manufacturing establishments yet erected within the limits of Texas;
        they respectfully petition the General Government, to grant for three years the privilege
        of introducing, free of duty, such articles as are indispensable to the prosperity of
        Texas. Among which, this Convention beg leave to enumerate the following, to wit:
        Provisions, Iron and Steel, Machinery, Farming Utensils, Tools of the various Mechanic
        Arts, Hardware and Hollowware, Nails, Waggons and Carts, Cotton Bagging and Bale rope,
        coarse Cotton Goods and Clothing, Shoes and Hats, Household and Kitchen Furniture, Tobacco
        for chewing in small quantities, Powder, Lead and Shot, Medicines, Books and Stationery.
        The foregoing articles include the principal imports made use of, and wanted by the
        inhabitants of Texas. Many of them are prohibited, and on those which are allowed to be
        introduced, the duties are so high that they amount to a prohibition. The trade to Texas
        is small, and the resources limited; but, if fostered by a liberal policy on the part of
        the General Government, it will, in a few years, yield a revenue of no small importance.</td>

    colonists, Austin failed in obtaining consideration for Statehood for Texas separate from
    Coahuila. He did succeed in obtaining modification of the law prohibiting immigration from

    separate Texas government. Farias ordered his arrest at Saltillo and he was held for about

<p id="first">Mexico&#39;s migration policy for Texas was similar to that
    for California and  New Mexico. A US citizen from Arkansas, Moses Austin, had acquired land in Texas in 1820. In  1823, Mexico confirmed this land grant and allowed Austin's son,  Stephen F. Austin, to sell plots of land to settlers
    so long as they were  of good character. Stephen Austin began
    advertising for settlers in frontier newspapers.  And he had no
    trouble finding takers. The land could be bought for 12.5
    cents an  acre &ndash; one tenth the cost of unwanted land in the
    United States. Austin&#39;s land 
    was good for farming crops such as cotton, sugar, corn, potatoes
    and fruit trees.  Word spread, and from Missouri, Arkansas,
    Kentucky and Tennessee, Illinois and  Ohio people came to
    Texas to buy land. Mexico responded
    by applying new restrictions. Foreigners could hold title
    to no more than 49,000  acres (which amounts to land 8.7 by
    8.7 miles). A head of a family could acquire  4,428 acres
    of land (2.6 by 2.6 miles) for a fee of 30 dollars, paid in
    installments  of from four to six years. </p>

			<p class="p4" style="width:250px">The Alamo </p></div>
  <p>In 1828, President  Andrew 
    Jackson offered to buy  Texas, but Mexico refused his offer. Austin&#39;s migrants, meanwhile, were demonstrating that they were  an industrious lot. Many arrived with their own tools and machinery. Most 
    had some education, and the migrants were setting up schools to educate their 
    young. Concerning Texas, Mexico was handicapped by its gap between its elite 
    and its poor. Mexico&#39;s elite had no desire to move to Texas and take up farming. 
    Mexico&#39;s poor  did not see themselves as having an opportunity to succeed 
    as farmers in Texas. The total population of Texas in 1829 was about 
    20,000, which left much of it still unsettled. There were about 1,000 slaves 
    and about 5,000 Mexicans.</p>
  <p>Leaders in Mexico City became worried about immigrants taking over Texas, 
    and they considered settling convicts in Texas or inviting Catholic migrants 
    from Europe. In 1829 President Guerrero abolished slavery in Mexico&#39;s territories 
    as a way of discouraging &quot;Yankee&quot; migration. In 1830, during the presidency of 
    Anastasio Bustamante, Mexico&#39;s Congress passed a law prohibiting foreigners 
    from settling on Mexican territory unless they had a passport issued by Mexico. 
    Mexico vowed strict enforcement of laws against a further introduction of slaves, 
    and it reimposed customs duties.</p>
  <p>Mexico began actively encouraging 
    Mexicans and people from Europe, particularly from Switzerland and Germany, 
    to settle in Texas. This upset the Anglos there.  They were concerned about 
    preserving their own culture and their ability to express themselves politically, 
    including a demand that slavery be allowed.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Mexico was in political turmoil again. President Bustamante was unpopular, 
    in part because of the execution of Vicente  Guerrero in February 1831. Santa Anna backed an uprising 
    against Bustamante in early 1832. Liberals sided with Santa Anna, seeing him 
    as one of them &ndash; the man who had proclaimed a republic back in 1822 and had 
    defended Mexico against the Spanish. Santa Anna rode into Mexico City in early 
    January, 1833. Elections were held, and Santa Anna won in a great landslide. 
    A liberal, Valent&iacute;n G&oacute;mez Far&iacute;as, became vice president. Santa Anna found the 
    duties of the presidency burdensome and returned to the comforts of his estate, 
    while remaining officially president. Presidential duties were left to the  
    vice president,  and he began a bold move against conservative 
    forces: the army and the Church. He reduced the size of the army and 
    put the army under more restrictive governmental controls. He moved to secularize 
    education and denied the Church its right to collect an involuntary tithe, leaving 
    what people gave the Church a matter of conscience. </p>
  <p>Anglos in Texas had cheered Santa Anna&#39;s electoral success, believing like 
    others that he was a liberal. The Anglos held a convention in 1833, at San Felipe, 130 miles east of <a href="map40-na.html">San Antonio</a>, attended by around 56 delegates. It called 
    for Mexico to repeal the anti-immigration section of its law of April 6, 1830. Texas 
    had been united with the state of <a title="Map of North America" href="map40-na.html">Coahuila</a> back in 1824, 
    and the convention called for Texas to become an independent state within Mexico. 
    It called also for judicial reform, habeas corpus, trial by jury, freedom of 
    the press, universal suffrage and improved mail service. The convention sent 
    Stephen Austin to <a href="map40-na.html">Mexico City</a> with their request for reform.</p>
  <p>On June 1, 1833, Mexico&#39;s military, led by General Gabri&eacute;l Dur&aacute;n, rebelled 
    against Vice President G&oacute;mez Far&iacute;as and kidnapped Santa Anna, declaring the great hero Santa 
    Anna to be dictator. Santa Anna went over to the side of the conservatives and 
    overthrew the government from which he had been absent. </p>
  <p>Austin had arrived in Mexico City in July and was received with hostility. 
    On his way back to Texas he was arrested  in Saltillo (70 kilometers southwest of <a title="Map of North America" href="map40-na.html">Monterrey</a>) and put in prison, accused of inciting insurrection in Texas.</p>
  <p>Santa Anna repealed the constitution of 1824, and in May 1834 he sent G&oacute;mez 
    Far&iacute;as into exile. For months Santa Anna&#39;s military attacked in various states, 
    Santa Anna allowing his military freedom  to intimidate any segment of society inclined to 
    rebel. In July 1835, Austin was freed under a general amnesty law and returned 
    to the United States through New Orleans, but in Texas the unrest continued. 
    In November, the Anglo-Americans defied Santa Anna by voting to defend Mexico&#39;s 
    1824 constitution, and volunteers began arriving from the United States to take 
    part in a war against Santa Anna.</p>
  <p>Santa Anna sent his brother-in law, General C&oacute;s, with 500 troops to Texas 
    to disarm the settlers and to expel &quot;troublemakers.&quot; C&oacute;s and company arrived 
    in September, 1835. Fighting erupted, and during the fighting in  November  
    the Anglo-Americans created a document known as the Organic Law, outlining a 
    provisional government for Texas. Then in December on the outskirts of <a title="Map of North America" href="map40-na.html">San Antonio</a> at a fortress 
    in a place called the Alamo, a horde of armed Anglo farmers defeated C&oacute;s, who 
    surrendered.</p>

<p>Santa Anna finished putting down a rebellion in the state
    of Zacatecas. He led an army toward Texas, and he lost half
    of his more than 6,000 ill-clad and ill-fed men crossing  desert
     through winter weather. In February he suddenly
    appeared in Texas with an army of 3,000. When C&oacute;s had surrendered
    to the Anglos he had promised to take his men with him out of Texas and 
    fight the Anglos no more, but C&oacute;s joined his 
    few hundred men with those of Santa Anna. The military leader
    of the Anglos,  Sam Houston, was practical and advised fighters to abandon
    San Antonio, proclaiming that standing  there was futile,
    but a couple of hundred of them refused. They decided
    to hold up at the place of victory against C&oacute;s &ndash; the Alamo.
    Most of the Anglos at the  Alamo followed the  commander there, Colonel William Travis, and  stayed to fight. </p>
  <p>Santa Anna raised a scarlet flag on the belfry of San Antonio&#39;s church, indicating 
    that he would not be granting mercy to any Anglo who surrendered. Among the 
    Anglos at the Alamo words were spoken about fighting to the death. In the fighting 
    that followed around 78 Mexicans died, 26 of them officers, and 251 Mexicans 
    were wounded. Only six of the 188 or so Anglo men survived. Santa Anna provided 
    the women and children at the Alamo safe passage through his lines. He gave 
    them protection, a blanket and a little money for survival. The six who surrendered 
    &ndash; one of whom was Davy Crocket &ndash; were cut down the following day with swords. 
    Crocket was a celebrity in the United States, and people there wanted to believe 
    that Crockett had gone down fighting to the end.</p>
  <p>Santa Anna assumed that he had defeated the Anglos of Texas, and he relaxed. 
    He dispersed his army and ordered that all Anglos caught bearing arms were to 
    be executed as pirates and that expenses for his campaign were to be raised 
    from confiscated property. One of his generals, Urrea, ambushed 41 Anglos at 
    Los Cuantes de Agua Dulce, and most of the 41 were killed, with no casualties 
    among Urrea&#39;s force. Urrea captured 400 Anglos near Goliad, 85 miles southeast 
    of San Antonio, and he requested amnesty from Santa Anna. Instead, Santa Anna ordered 
    all to be executed, and the executions took place on March 27, 1836. The Anglos 
    in Texas, meanwhile, on March 2, had issued their <a title="Map of North America" href="/web/20160517211551/http://www.fsmitha.com/scnd/zdocu.html#texas">Declaration of Independence</a>.</p>
  <p>On April 20, Santa Anna, now with a force of around 1,110 men, met a force 
    of 800 men led by Sam Houston, near the San Jacinto River, on the eastern side 
    of what is now the city of Houston. Houston's practicality regarding the Alamo – of living to fight another day – paid off. Houson's force overwhelmed Santa Anna's. While Santa-Anna had been napping he  was taken prisoner.  Some Anglos wanted him killed. 
    Santa Anna was unnerved and asked for, and was given, some opium. Houston treated 
    Santa Anna as a guest, and he won from Santa Anna a pledge to end the fighting 
    and to withdraw Mexico&#39;s army from Texas. A second pledge by Santa Anna remained 
    secret, an agreement by Santa Anna to prepare Mexico City to receive a peace 
    delegation from Texas for formal recognition of the independence of Texas. </p>
<p>One of Santa Anna&#39;s generals obeyed Santa Anna and withdrew Mexican military 
  personnel from Texas. In November, 1836, Houston allowed Santa Anna to travel 
  to Washington, where Santa Anna met with President Andrew Jackson and a delegation 
  from Texas. There, during a dinner, Santa Anna tried unassertively to sell Texas 
  to the United States at a bargain price, but Jackson was not buying. He saw 
  Texas as already independent of Mexico, and he sent Santa Anna back to Vera Cruz 
  aboard a US warship. </p>
  <p>In 1837, the United States officially recognized Texas as
    independent. Mexico  refused such recognition. France established a trade
    agreement with Texas and recognized it as independent in 1839.
    Trade agreements and recognition by Great Britain, Holland
    and Belgium followed months later.</p>

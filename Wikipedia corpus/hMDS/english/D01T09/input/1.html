		<h2 id="h2-0001">AWRE</h2>
		<p><a name="p1"> </a>The parish of Awre <a href="#fnn1" name="anchorn1">(fn. 1)</a> lies 16 km. south-west of
Gloucester between the river Severn and the
Forest of Dean. The large parish contained
seven manorial estates, numerous ancient farmsteads, the industrial and trading village of
Blakeney which replaced Awre village as the
principal centre of population, and the small but
commercially significant riverside hamlet of
Gatcombe. The whole of Awre parish was included within the jurisdiction of the Forest
before 1228 and, apart from the hamlet of Box
which was disafforested in the early 14th century, remained within it for as long as it had
significance. <a href="#fnn2" name="anchorn2">(fn. 2)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p2"> </a>The ancient parish covered 4,520 a. (1,831 ha),
or 6,173 a. if all the foreshore and river within
its boundaries were included. <a href="#fnn3" name="anchorn3">(fn. 3)</a> A wide meander
of the river Severn forms a long boundary on
the north-east and south-east, the north-west
boundary mainly follows watercourses, including Haie brook, and the south-west
boundary follows Lanes brook. <a href="#fnn4" name="anchorn4">(fn. 4)</a> On the west
the boundary with the extraparochial Forest of
Dean was an irregular one. From Ayleford in
the north it followed the hillside above the
valley of Soudley brook, descended close to the
main Gloucester-Chepstow road near the bottom of the valley of Blackpool brook at Nibley,
crossed the lower slopes of Viney hill, and
climbed to take in a rectangular block of land
around Hayes wood. <a href="#fnn5" name="anchorn5">(fn. 5)</a> The wood was probably
a late addition to the parish: it owed a rent to
Flaxley manor in 1570, <a href="#fnn6" name="anchorn6">(fn. 6)</a> suggesting that it was
among late 13th- and early 14th-century assarts
whose rents were assigned to Flaxley abbey in
1353. <a href="#fnn7" name="anchorn7">(fn. 7)</a> In 1935 the block including Hayes wood,
comprising 111 a., was transferred to West Dean
civil parish, <a href="#fnn8" name="anchorn8">(fn. 8)</a> and in 1953 850 a. of East Dean,
including Blakeney Hill woods, Blakeney Hill
hamlet, and part of Viney Hill hamlet, were added
to Awre parish. <a href="#fnn9" name="anchorn9">(fn. 9)</a> The account given here covers
the parish as constituted before 1935.</p>
		<p><a name="p3"> </a>Low-lying land in the east and centre of the
parish is formed of the lower lias and red marl,
while an extensive level at Awre Point, <a href="#fnn10" name="anchorn10">(fn. 10)</a> enclosed
by a loop of the Severn, and a smaller area further
south, around the sinuous inlet called Brimspill
(or Brimpspill), are formed of alluvium. The
lower land of the parish is bounded by an
area of higher ground formed of the Old Red
Sandstone: <a href="#fnn11" name="anchorn11">(fn. 11)</a> in the north and south are gently rolling hills at around 30-60 m., which
culminate in low river cliffs at Box and
around Gatcombe, while in the north-west a
higher ridge rises to over 106 m. before
dropping to the deep valley of Soudley brook
near the west boundary. The land is drained
principally by Bideford brook, which is
formed at Blakeney by the confluence of
Soudley <a href="#fnn12" name="anchorn12">(fn. 12)</a> (or Forge) brook and Blackpool
brook <a href="#fnn13" name="anchorn13">(fn. 13)</a> and receives a number of small tributaries before flowing into the Severn at
Brimspill. At intervals along the bank small
streams reach the river by other muddy inlets,
known on the lower Severn as pills.</p>
		<p><a name="p4"> </a>The scattered nature of settlement, the predominance of ancient closes, and the numerous
small groves all suggest that most of the parish
emerged from ancient woodland. Hayes wood,
extended at 40 a. in 1570 <a href="#fnn14" name="anchorn14">(fn. 14)</a> and 56 a. in 1839, <a href="#fnn15" name="anchorn15">(fn. 15)</a> 
was the most substantial piece of woodland
surviving in modern times. The smaller groves
included Box and Phips groves on the Box farm
estate at the north end of the parish, which each
covered 8 a. in the 1730s when a local tanner
held them on lease, presumably as a source of
bark. <a href="#fnn16" name="anchorn16">(fn. 16)</a> Only in the east around Awre village was
there a fully developed system of open fields and
common meadows; that area was inclosed in
1796. Pastoral farming has predominated and
orchards were once widespread. <a href="#fnn17" name="anchorn17">(fn. 17)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p5"> </a>The eastern tip of the parish is formed
mainly of land reclaimed from the river
Severn. About 350 m. east of Awre village and
church the ground falls to a level, which is
crossed by a series of reens (drainage ditches)
and was once farmed mainly as open fields.
Much of the level had presumably been gained
from the river before the 12th century when
the bank was perhaps on the line of a continuous hedge boundary that was once apparent
between a house called Hayward on the southeast and Hamstalls cliff on the north-west. <a href="#fnn18" name="anchorn18">(fn. 18)</a> A
sea wall, described in 1846 as the main sea wall, <a href="#fnn19" name="anchorn19">(fn. 19)</a> 
once ran along that boundary and remains of it
near the north-west end survived until the early
20th century. <a href="#fnn20" name="anchorn20">(fn. 20)</a> Land called Hayward, evidently
in the area adjoining the house, <a href="#fnn21" name="anchorn21">(fn. 21)</a> was reclaimed
by the lord of Awre manor <em>c</em>. 1140, <a href="#fnn22" name="anchorn22">(fn. 22)</a> and probably at the same period a broad strip of land
called the Old Warth (or Wharf) running across
Awre Point from near Hayward towards Hamstalls cliff was won from the river. <a href="#fnn23" name="anchorn23">(fn. 23)</a> The Old Warth
was presumably the land described as 'le Warth
ex alia parte Sabrine' belonging to Awre manor <em>c</em>.
1300 <a href="#fnn24" name="anchorn24">(fn. 24)</a> and the pasture on 'Awre sand' mentioned
in 1303. <a href="#fnn25" name="anchorn25">(fn. 25)</a> It was in regular use for pasturing cattle
by 1319, <a href="#fnn26" name="anchorn26">(fn. 26)</a> and later remained common to the
tenants of the manor. By the beginning of the 17th
century a further strip of land, known as the New
Warth (or Wharf), was emerging from the river
beyond the Old Warth. It was evidently claimed
by the tenants as an extension to the common,
but in 1612 they agreed that their lord, Sir
Edward Winter, could hold it in severalty, <a href="#fnn27" name="anchorn27">(fn. 27)</a> and
two years later his tenant Richard White inclosed and drained <em>c</em>. 30 a. by making numerous
drainage furrows, two cribs (breakwaters), and
a long reen to divide it from the Old Warth. <a href="#fnn28" name="anchorn28">(fn. 28)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p6"> </a>The reclaimed land remained subject to flooding at very high tides <a href="#fnn29" name="anchorn29">(fn. 29)</a> and its banks to wasting
by the setting and ebbing of the tide. Cribs to
turn or limit the force of the tide were maintained at critical points. At the north-west end
of the warths there was one called Hamstalls crib
in the early 1720s when a second one was built
beside it, <a href="#fnn30" name="anchorn30">(fn. 30)</a> and by 1732 Amity crib defended the
south end of the point. <a href="#fnn31" name="anchorn31">(fn. 31)</a> By that time a shift in
the main channel of the river had removed part
of the New Warth, which was extended at only
15 a. in 1731. <a href="#fnn32" name="anchorn32">(fn. 32)</a> Some new ground which appeared in the mid 1740s was soon lost again, <a href="#fnn33" name="anchorn33">(fn. 33)</a> 
but before 1796 a more sustained build-up of
land enlarged the New Warth to 49 a. <a href="#fnn34" name="anchorn34">(fn. 34)</a> and by
the 1840s a new, outer sea wall had been built
to defend it. <a href="#fnn35" name="anchorn35">(fn. 35)</a> In the late 1840s much work to
defend the point, including the rebuilding of the
cribs and the addition of new ones, was carried
out under the direction of William Clegram of
Saul, engineer to the Gloucester and Berkeley
canal company. <a href="#fnn36" name="anchorn36">(fn. 36)</a> The Old Warth was inclosed
and absorbed into the field pattern in 1796 <a href="#fnn37" name="anchorn37">(fn. 37)</a> but
the New Warth remained a notable feature of
the landscape in 1989, extending for over a mile
along the point. By then a further strip of land,
beyond its 19th-century sea wall, had been
reclaimed and grassed over, and the long reen
built in 1614 on the warth's landward side was
dry and partly silted.</p>
		<p><a name="p7"> </a>South-west of Awre Point, where the main
channel of the river generally ran close inshore, <a href="#fnn38" name="anchorn38">(fn. 38)</a> 
the river bank was particularly subject to erosion. The channel may have shifted from the
opposite bank shortly before 1234 when land
claimed by Awre parish was awarded to Slimbridge. <a href="#fnn39" name="anchorn39">(fn. 39)</a> More land was probably lost in the
early 17th century, when part of the New
Grounds in Slimbridge and warths in other
parishes on the opposite bank were being
formed, <a href="#fnn40" name="anchorn40">(fn. 40)</a> and erosion of the Awre bank removed
several dwellings and their home closes around
Woodend Lane, south of the village, during the
18th century. <a href="#fnn41" name="anchorn41">(fn. 41)</a> If that part of the bank was
defended by a sea wall it had vanished between
Woodend Marsh, 450 m. north-east of Woodend
Lane, and Brimspill by the early 19th century. <a href="#fnn42" name="anchorn42">(fn. 42)</a> 
During 1850 and 1851, to Clegram's plans, a
new wall and a series of cribs were built to
protect land north-east of Brimspill, <a href="#fnn43" name="anchorn43">(fn. 43)</a> but near
Woodend Lane erosion continued unchecked <a href="#fnn44" name="anchorn44">(fn. 44)</a> 
and the bank there was still crumbling in the
1980s.</p>
		<p><a name="p8"> </a>The Severn's fisheries and the river trade were
sources of income and employment in the parish. <a href="#fnn45" name="anchorn45">(fn. 45)</a> The river's presence was also made evident
in the frequent burials of the drowned in Awre
churchyard, in many cases victims of shipwreck or other accidents who were carried on
to Awre Point by the currents. <a href="#fnn46" name="anchorn46">(fn. 46)</a> Vessels often
foundered on the dangerous Noose sandbank off
the point or in the exposed waters further
south. <a href="#fnn47" name="anchorn47">(fn. 47)</a> One of the heaviest losses was in 1732
when 17 people drowned in the wreck of a
Newnham trow. <a href="#fnn48" name="anchorn48">(fn. 48)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p9"> </a>The main road through the parish, linking
Gloucester and Chepstow (Mon.), probably follows for most of its course a Roman road leading
from Newnham to Caerleon (Mon.); the names
of Stretfield hill, north of Blakeney, and Oldstreet House, near the south boundary of the
parish, presumably derive from that ancient
road. <a href="#fnn49" name="anchorn49">(fn. 49)</a> The Gloucester-Chepstow road was a
turnpike from 1757 until 1871. <a href="#fnn50" name="anchorn50">(fn. 50)</a> Improvements
carried out under the trust included a new line
of road built during 1809 and 1810 to avoid
Gurshill in Lydney, beginning near Awre's
south-west boundary, <a href="#fnn51" name="anchorn51">(fn. 51)</a> and a new, curving descent into Blakeney village from the north-east,
built during 1830 and 1831 to replace a steeper
and more direct descent called Swan Lane. <a href="#fnn52" name="anchorn52">(fn. 52)</a> A
road down Viney hill, crossing the Gloucester-
Chepstow turnpike at the south end of Nibley
green, was by the late 18th century much used
for carrying timber from the Forest woods to the
riverside at Gatcombe and Purton. That usage
led the Crown to pay for its upkeep for some
years before 1796 when it was included in the
first Forest turnpike Act, some of the funds
provided by the Crown under the Act being used
on the road. <a href="#fnn53" name="anchorn53">(fn. 53)</a> Tollgates were sited at Nibley
green and at Etloe House near where the road
forked for Gatcombe and Purton. <a href="#fnn54" name="anchorn54">(fn. 54)</a> In 1841 the
Forest turnpike trustees built a new road down
the valley of Blackpool brook to join the
Gloucester-Chepstow turnpike at Nibley, <a href="#fnn55" name="anchorn55">(fn. 55)</a> 
where a tollgate was placed on the parish boundary near the bottom of the road. <a href="#fnn56" name="anchorn56">(fn. 56)</a> The two roads
leading down from the Forest remained turnpikes until 1888. <a href="#fnn57" name="anchorn57">(fn. 57)</a> A third route from the Forest,
down the west side of the valley of Soudley
brook to Blakeney, <a href="#fnn58" name="anchorn58">(fn. 58)</a> was much improved by the
Awre local board of health in 1889 <a href="#fnn59" name="anchorn59">(fn. 59)</a> at the same
time as the Crown built the adjoining part of the
road within the Forest. <a href="#fnn60" name="anchorn60">(fn. 60)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p10"> </a>Awre village was linked to the Gloucester-Chepstow road by the road, usually called the
Newnham road, running to the north boundary
of the parish and by another road which branched
from the Newnham road at Cockshoot, south of
Box Farm, and ran past Bledisloe Farm. <a href="#fnn61" name="anchorn61">(fn. 61)</a> The
latter road, which in its western part was called
Chicknalls Lane, <a href="#fnn62" name="anchorn62">(fn. 62)</a> survived only as a footpath
between Cockshoot and Bledisloe Farm in 1989.
An extensive system of footpaths called church
ways or burying roads, which the local court leet
jury was vigilant in preserving in the 18th and
19th centuries, linked the many scattered farmsteads to Awre church and Blakeney chapel. <a href="#fnn63" name="anchorn63">(fn. 63)</a> A
footpath making the circuit of the river bank was
repaired and improved as part of the Severn
Way long-distance path in the 1980s.</p>
		<p><a name="p11"> </a>Powers for building the main South Wales
railway line through Awre were obtained by
an Act of 1846 under which the Gloucester
and Dean Forest company was to build the
line as far as Hagloe and the South Wales
company to continue it southwards. In the
event the whole line through the parish, opened
in 1851, was built by the South Wales company,
which amalgamated with the Great Western
Railway in 1863. <a href="#fnn64" name="anchorn64">(fn. 64)</a> The parish was served by a
station at Purton in Lydney, but called Gatcombe station, until 1868 when Awre Junction
station was built beside the Awre-Blakeney road
at the junction with the new Forest of Dean
Central railway. Awre Junction station was
closed to passengers and general freight in 1959
and to coal in 1961. <a href="#fnn65" name="anchorn65">(fn. 65)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p12"> </a>An attempt to build a railway from the Forest
into Awre parish was made in 1832. The bill
failed in parliament but parts of the line, to be
worked by steam locomotives running to Purton
by way of a tunnel under Old hill at Nibley, had
already been built, and a bridge over the Purton
road at the south end of the parish survived in
1989. <a href="#fnn66" name="anchorn66">(fn. 66)</a> In 1856 an Act was acquired for the
Forest of Dean Central railway, a mineral and
goods line to link collieries in the centre of the
Forest with the South Wales line and with the
Severn at Brimspill, where docks for shipping
coal and timber were to be built. The line,
running to Awre Junction through Blakeney village, where there was a goods station, was not
opened until 1868, by which time the G.W.R. had
taken on its operation. It was never a commercial
success, running trains only on three days a week
at first and even less frequently later, and,
although the line was continued to Brimspill, the
docks were never made. Traffic ceased to run on
the line west of Blakeney <em>c</em>. 1921 and between
Blakeney and Awre Junction in 1949. <a href="#fnn67" name="anchorn67">(fn. 67)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p13"> </a>Awre parish comprised six tithings, based on
ancient manors. Awre tithing included the village and the area enclosed in the loop of the
Severn; the large tithing of Bledisloe occupied the
area north of a line drawn roughly from Blakeney
village to the Severn at Hamstalls Pill, north-west
of the house called Hamstalls; Hagloe, apparently
coterminous with the ancient manor called Poulton, <a href="#fnn68" name="anchorn68">(fn. 68)</a> occupied the centre of the parish and the
banks of the Severn between Brimspill and Gatcombe; Etloe tithing extended from the
Gloucester-Chepstow road, where it included
the south part of Blakeney village, southwards
towards Gatcombe; Etloe Duchy, once a manor
of the Duchy of Lancaster, occupied the south
end of the parish bounded roughly by the Purton
turnpike road; and Blakeney tithing comprised
the north part of Blakeney village and land lying
west of the Gloucester-Chepstow road.</p>
		<p><a name="p14"> </a>Awre village, in its isolated situation near the
river in the east part of the parish, is a loose
collection of small farmsteads. It was once
larger, though probably always scattered in plan;
a number of houses were lost before the late 18th
century, some as a result of the amalgamation
of holdings and others by coastal erosion. <a href="#fnn69" name="anchorn69">(fn. 69)</a> Most
of the houses stand along a low ridge which rises
above the eastern level. There is a small concentration near the parish church, around the
junction from which the Newnham road leads
north-west, the Blakeney road west, Woodend
Lane south to the river, and Marsh Road eastwards into the former open fields of the level.
The part of the village at the junction, where
there was a small green, was known as
Churchend in 1493. <a href="#fnn70" name="anchorn70">(fn. 70)</a> The Red Hart inn had
opened in a building on the south-east by 1796, <a href="#fnn71" name="anchorn71">(fn. 71)</a> 
and in the 19th century the junction was the site
of the village pound and a smithy. <a href="#fnn72" name="anchorn72">(fn. 72)</a> The inn
dates partly from the 17th century, and a house
called Bray's Court is 17th-century in origin but
was remodelled and enlarged in the early 19th.
There are also a few cottages of the late 18th
century or early 19th. The medieval manor
house called the Lypiatt once stood east of
Churchend above the level. On the level the only
known dwelling was Hayward, built <em>c</em>. 1680 at
the east end of Marsh Road. <a href="#fnn73" name="anchorn73">(fn. 73)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p15"> </a>South of Churchend a small hamlet called
Woodend stood close to the river, around
Woodend Lane. Whitescourt on the east side of
the lane was recorded as a farmhouse on the
manor estate from 1493. <a href="#fnn74" name="anchorn74">(fn. 74)</a> It was ruinous in 1857
when it was planned to demolish it <a href="#fnn75" name="anchorn75">(fn. 75)</a> and there
were only farm buildings at the site in 1989. A
cottage of <em>c</em>. 1900 on the opposite side of the lane
occupies the site of a small customary tenement called Woodend Close, recorded from
the late 17th century, <a href="#fnn76" name="anchorn76">(fn. 76)</a> and further north a
modern house had by 1989 replaced another
ancient tenement called Midways, <a href="#fnn77" name="anchorn77">(fn. 77)</a> probably
once the home of Richard de Midwey (fl.
1327). <a href="#fnn78" name="anchorn78">(fn. 78)</a> Most of the other houses of Woodend
were lost as a result of erosion of the river
bank. One called Guildings, possibly northeast of the end of Woodend Lane, was under
threat in 1691 and another had been lost by
1707. In 1741 the court leet reported that three
houses of customary tenants had been washed
away and three more were threatened. <a href="#fnn79" name="anchorn79">(fn. 79)</a> Just
west of the end of the lane stood a freehold
farmhouse called Woodend House, which was
the home of the Hopkins family until <em>c</em>. 1800
when it was abandoned because of the crumbling
of the bank. <a href="#fnn80" name="anchorn80">(fn. 80)</a> A house nearby, known as the
Garrison by 1721, <a href="#fnn81" name="anchorn81">(fn. 81)</a> was taken down <em>c</em>. 1810,
though its site was further inland and probably
not under threat from erosion. <a href="#fnn82" name="anchorn82">(fn. 82)</a> Some of the
houses at Woodend were formerly served by
Slough Green Lane which led from Woodend
Lane round to join the Blakeney road near Hall
Farm. <a href="#fnn83" name="anchorn83">(fn. 83)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p16"> </a>A few small farmhouses, mostly rebuilt in
brick or stone in the late 18th century, stand at
intervals along the Newnham road north-west
of Churchend. They include Upper House
Farm, New House Farm, and Fort House, the
last probably on the site of the messuage held
with a close called Forthay in 1493. <a href="#fnn84" name="anchorn84">(fn. 84)</a> Houses
once called Howlets and Filkins and a small
farmhouse called Brunches, near the north-west
end of the village, <a href="#fnn85" name="anchorn85">(fn. 85)</a> are all on early sites, <a href="#fnn86" name="anchorn86">(fn. 86)</a> the
first probably the home of Thomas Howlet in
1493. <a href="#fnn87" name="anchorn87">(fn. 87)</a> At a small green, called Vertues green
in 1699 and later Awre green, <a href="#fnn88" name="anchorn88">(fn. 88)</a> the Newnham
road is joined by Northington Lane. Guy Hall,
on the west side of the lane, is the remnant of
a substantial 16th- or 17th-century house, evidently owned by and named from Guy Hall (d.
1694); <a href="#fnn89" name="anchorn89">(fn. 89)</a> his freehold estate, which was divided
among several owners after his death, <a href="#fnn90" name="anchorn90">(fn. 90)</a> probably
included Guy Hall Farm, a gabled 17th-century
house of rubble stone on the east side of the lane.
Northington Farm, at the north end of the lane,
was rebuilt in stone in the late 18th or early 19th
century and extended in the late 19th. Formerly
called Cades, <a href="#fnn91" name="anchorn91">(fn. 91)</a> it was probably the dwelling of
Thomas Cady of Northington in 1462, <a href="#fnn92" name="anchorn92">(fn. 92)</a> while
Seabrights, the old name of a cottage nearby, <a href="#fnn93" name="anchorn93">(fn. 93)</a> 
recalls Thomas Seabright, a customary tenant in
1493. <a href="#fnn94" name="anchorn94">(fn. 94)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p17"> </a>On the western fringes of the village, Field
House and Hall Farm are substantial and long
established farmsteads, <a href="#fnn95" name="anchorn95">(fn. 95)</a> and the building of a
small group of cottages at a place called Shepherd on the Blakeney road <a href="#fnn96" name="anchorn96">(fn. 96)</a> had begun by
1728. <a href="#fnn97" name="anchorn97">(fn. 97)</a> The house at Hamstalls, by the river
bank north-west of the village, was recorded
from 1710 <a href="#fnn98" name="anchorn98">(fn. 98)</a> and was enlarged <em>c</em>. 1732. <a href="#fnn99" name="anchorn99">(fn. 99)</a> In 1796
it was an inn, <a href="#fnn100" name="anchorn100">(fn. 100)</a> serving river traffic, and it
probably had the sign of the Three Doves in
1824. <a href="#fnn101" name="anchorn101">(fn. 101)</a> The inn had closed by 1830. <a href="#fnn102" name="anchorn102">(fn. 102)</a> Later in
the 19th century Hamstalls was occupied as
two dwellings <a href="#fnn103" name="anchorn103">(fn. 103)</a> but in the early 20th it became
a single residence under the name of the
Priory. <a href="#fnn104" name="anchorn104">(fn. 104)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p18"> </a>Bledisloe tithing, like Etloe and Hagloe, probably took its name from an ancient tumulus, <a href="#fnn105" name="anchorn105">(fn. 105)</a> 
which in the case of Bledisloe was presumably the
hundred meeting place. It may have been beside
the Gloucester-Chepstow road at the highest point
of the ridge over which the road runs. A field called
Bledisloe field in 1671 lay west of the road at that
point <a href="#fnn106" name="anchorn106">(fn. 106)</a> and a house called Bledisloe Cottage was
built nearby in the mid 19th century. A green
called Gallows green, which was inclosed before
the mid 17th century and a cottage built on it, lay
on the main road in Bledisloe tithing, <a href="#fnn107" name="anchorn107">(fn. 107)</a> perhaps
further north at the junction with Chicknalls Lane
or at Howell's Cross where Howell's Lane <a href="#fnn108" name="anchorn108">(fn. 108)</a> 
branches westwards towards Ayleford. The site
of Bledisloe manor was east of the main road, at
Bledisloe Farm on Chicknalls Lane. <a href="#fnn109" name="anchorn109">(fn. 109)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p19"> </a>Settlement in Bledisloe tithing consists of
farmsteads scattered widely through the north
part of the parish and a few, mostly later,
houses on the Gloucester-Chepstow road. A
group of closes called Pullminton or Pomerton
on the eastern slopes of the valley of Soudley
brook <a href="#fnn110" name="anchorn110">(fn. 110)</a> apparently includes the site of a deserted
medieval hamlet, for three inhabitants of
Pullminton were mentioned in 1282 <a href="#fnn111" name="anchorn111">(fn. 111)</a> and a
tradition recorded <em>c</em>. 1700 tells of a 'town' at the
place. <a href="#fnn112" name="anchorn112">(fn. 112)</a> There is also evidence of a vanished
hamlet at Box in the east part of the tithing, once
the site of a manor based on Box Farm on the
Awre-Newnham road. If, as suggested below,
Box can be identified with an estate recorded in
1086 it already had a population of 17 bordars
and their families, <a href="#fnn113" name="anchorn113">(fn. 113)</a> and in the 13th century and
the early 14th, when it was a separate vill, <a href="#fnn114" name="anchorn114">(fn. 114)</a> 
considerable numbers of people were surnamed
of Box or of Box cliff (Boxclive). <a href="#fnn115" name="anchorn115">(fn. 115)</a> In 1669 there
were some houses or cottages in a field by the
road just north of Box Farm called Chapel Hay
(later Chapel Hill), <a href="#fnn116" name="anchorn116">(fn. 116)</a> possibly the site of a chapel.
Maiden Hall, a farmhouse west of Box Farm,
was called Little Box Farm in 1694 when it
belonged to the James family of Stroat, in
Tidenham. <a href="#fnn117" name="anchorn117">(fn. 117)</a> The house had been demolished by
1989 when Box Farm, a pair of 19th-century
farm cottages, and two modern houses were the
only dwellings at Box. Two small farmhouses
some way to the south, in Hagloe tithing, also
bore the name Box <a href="#fnn118" name="anchorn118">(fn. 118)</a> but do not appear to have had
any tenurial or other connexion with Box manor.</p>
		<p><a name="p20"> </a>A house called Cox which stood on the site of
Oaklands Farm near the north-west boundary
of the parish was recorded from the late 16th
century. <a href="#fnn119" name="anchorn119">(fn. 119)</a> Hulin's Farm, on the north boundary, <a href="#fnn120" name="anchorn120">(fn. 120)</a> 
was named from the Hulin or Huling family
which bought it, with the adjoining Hulin's
wood, in 1682. The Hulins sold their farm in
1820 to the Revd. Edward Jones, <a href="#fnn121" name="anchorn121">(fn. 121)</a> owner of the
adjoining Hayhill estate in Newnham, <a href="#fnn122" name="anchorn122">(fn. 122)</a> and by
1839 his estate also included Haiebrook Farm
beside the brook on the north-west boundary. <a href="#fnn123" name="anchorn123">(fn. 123)</a> 
In 1989, when the land of the estate was managed from a farmhouse in Newnham, <a href="#fnn124" name="anchorn124">(fn. 124)</a> the two
farmhouses in Awre stood empty and derelict.
Hulin's Farm, originally timber-framed but
later mainly walled in rubble or brick, has an
early 17th-century range of one storey and attics.
A large lateral stack stands close to the northeast corner, joined to the main range by a
transeptal roof. A low 19th-century range adjoins on the north side. Haiebrook Farm is a very
small <strong>L</strong>-shaped house of one storey and attics,
also of the the early 17th century. At the beginning of the 19th century a two-storeyed block
was built in the angle between the two ranges,
and it was perhaps at the same time that the old
north range was converted to a cider-mill house.
Hickman's Court on Chicknalls Lane is another
small 17th-century farmhouse, built of rubble
stone and with a 19th-century addition. At
Hawfield, south of Stretfield hill above Blakeney, a small 17th-century farmhouse has been
enlarged to a substantial dwelling house: in the
18th century part of the house was heightened
and remodelled, early in the 19th century a
parallel range with a brick front was added along
the south-east side, and in 1922 <a href="#fnn125" name="anchorn125">(fn. 125)</a> extensive
additions in Tudor style were made on the
north. New House, built <em>c</em>. 1790 on the main
road near the junction with Howell's Lane,
and Oaklands Park, built near the north
boundary <em>c</em>. 1818 and later much enlarged,
were the principal residences in the north part
of the parish in the 19th century. <a href="#fnn126" name="anchorn126">(fn. 126)</a> A few
houses added on the main road in the early
19th century included two large Regency villas
called Kingscroft (later Kingsland) and Underdean. <a href="#fnn127" name="anchorn127">(fn. 127)</a> In the late 19th century and the
early 20th Underdean was the home of the
Jones family, formerly of Nass and Hayhill. <a href="#fnn128" name="anchorn128">(fn. 128)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p21"> </a>On the west boundary of the parish some houses
were built near the Ayleford-Blakeney road, including Hewler's Farm, a three-storeyed farmhouse
of the late 17th century, and a few mid 19th-century cottages, loosely connected to the adjoining
Forest hamlet of Blakeney Hill. Higher up the
road in an area once known as Woodside, lying
below the wooded plateau at the edge of the
Forest, is a roadside green called Brain's green,
perhaps named from George Brain of Woodside
who died in 1733. <a href="#fnn129" name="anchorn129">(fn. 129)</a> The scatter of cottages called
Brain's Green is mainly outside the parish boundary but an earlier, fairly substantial dwelling called
Seamsty or Woodside <a href="#fnn130" name="anchorn130">(fn. 130)</a> belonged to Awre. It was
bought by John Chinn in 1675 <a href="#fnn131" name="anchorn131">(fn. 131)</a> and later passed
to a branch of the A Deane family. <a href="#fnn132" name="anchorn132">(fn. 132)</a> Unoccupied
from 1788, it fell into disrepair in the early 19th
century <a href="#fnn133" name="anchorn133">(fn. 133)</a> but was apparently represented later
by Woodside House which stood at the north
end of the green <a href="#fnn134" name="anchorn134">(fn. 134)</a> until demolished in the early
or mid 20th century. The settlement on Brain's
green was linked to Howell's Lane at the northwest corner of the parish by an ancient lane,
disused by 1989, which led from Woodside
House into the deep valley of Soudley brook. At
Ayleford where it crossed the brook is a stone
farmhouse called Rowmedley, <a href="#fnn135" name="anchorn135">(fn. 135)</a> built in the 17th
century and much altered in the 19th. A house
nearby, where Howell's Lane crosses the parish
boundary at Haie brook, was a beerhouse called
the Two Bridges in the late 19th century and
the early 20th. <a href="#fnn136" name="anchorn136">(fn. 136)</a>

		<p><a name="p22"> </a>Hagloe tithing comprised only scattered
farmsteads. Poulton Court, the site of a manor
from the early Middle Ages, was later absorbed
with almost the whole tithing into the large
Hagloe estate, centred on the early 18th-century
Hagloe House. <a href="#fnn137" name="anchorn137">(fn. 137)</a> The smaller farmsteads of the
tithing, few of which survived in the 1980s,
were probably established at an early date,
most of them deriving from the five customary
tenements recorded on Poulton manor in the
mid 16th century. <a href="#fnn138" name="anchorn138">(fn. 138)</a> At Little Hagloe (formerly
Upper Hagloe) in the south part of the tithing
two small farmsteads once stood on either side
of a lane. <a href="#fnn139" name="anchorn139">(fn. 139)</a> That on the south side was recorded
from 1525 when the Driver family held it by
copy from Poulton manor; <a href="#fnn140" name="anchorn140">(fn. 140)</a> the Drivers
bought the house and its lands from the manor
in 1568 and continued to farm there for the
next 200 years. <a href="#fnn141" name="anchorn141">(fn. 141)</a> The farmhouse on the north
side of the lane was possibly that owned by
the Hyman family of Hagloe from 1568 to the
1730s. <a href="#fnn142" name="anchorn142">(fn. 142)</a> Later it formed part of the Hagloe
estate, which also acquired the farmhouse on
the south side in 1900. <a href="#fnn143" name="anchorn143">(fn. 143)</a> In the same year the
Crown as owner of the estate built a pair of
farm cottages <a href="#fnn144" name="anchorn144">(fn. 144)</a> at Little Hagloe, and the two
farmhouses and their buildings were later
abandoned, only some ruins surviving in 1989.
A small farmhouse called Merryway, close to
the Awre-Blakeney road at the north-east end
of Hagloe tithing, was recorded from 1718 <a href="#fnn145" name="anchorn145">(fn. 145)</a> 
and demolished <em>c</em>. 1870; <a href="#fnn146" name="anchorn146">(fn. 146)</a> another called Old
Box, which in 1681 stood north-west of Bideford brook close to the house called Little
Box, <a href="#fnn147" name="anchorn147">(fn. 147)</a> was also demolished later, leaving only
a barn at the site; and at Poulton, north-west
of Little Box, <a href="#fnn148" name="anchorn148">(fn. 148)</a> only some ruins of a stone
farmhouse were to be seen in 1989. Little Box
was recorded from the early 18th century <a href="#fnn149" name="anchorn149">(fn. 149)</a> and
the Ledge (or Lodge), north-east of Hagloe
House, from 1656, <a href="#fnn150" name="anchorn150">(fn. 150)</a> but both farmhouses were
rebuilt in the late 18th century or the early
19th. A few farm cottages stand on the Awre-
Blakeney road, including a pair built by the Crown
in 1890. <a href="#fnn151" name="anchorn151">(fn. 151)</a>

		<p><a name="p23"> </a>Etloe was said in 1583 to contain 10 or 12
houses, <a href="#fnn152" name="anchorn152">(fn. 152)</a> figures that presumably referred only
to scattered dwellings in the south part of the
tithing and did not include the part of Blakeney
village in Etloe. Several of those scattered dwellings had been demolished by the early 19th
century, including ancient customary tenements
of the manor of Awre and Etloe called Martins
and Barrows on Millend Lane, running south
from Blakeney, and others called Cowleys and
Wafields on the cliffs south-west of Gatcombe. <a href="#fnn153" name="anchorn153">(fn. 153)</a> 
Nether Hall, by the Awre-Blakeney road in
the north-east of the tithing, was recorded
from 1493. <a href="#fnn154" name="anchorn154">(fn. 154)</a> Alienated from Awre and Etloe
manor in 1656, <a href="#fnn155" name="anchorn155">(fn. 155)</a> it later passed to a branch of
the A Deanes and to their kinsmen the Bayleys
of Bristol. <a href="#fnn156" name="anchorn156">(fn. 156)</a> A portion of a late-medieval timber-framed house, including two cut-down
base crucks, survives as part of its farm buildings. The east end of the present farmhouse is
of a single storey with attics and may be part
of the central range and cross wing of a 16thor 17th-century house, which was partly destroyed in the 18th century when a
three-storeyed block was added on the west. The
A Deane family also held Etloe House, at the
junction of Millend Lane and the Purton turnpike
road, and made it the centre of the principal estate
of the tithing. <a href="#fnn157" name="anchorn157">(fn. 157)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p24"> </a>Small groups of dwellings were formed on the
Purton turnpike at Upper Etloe west of Etloe
House and at Lower Etloe south of the turn to
Gatcombe. Lower Etloe, which includes a small
17th-century farmhouse, probably represents
some of the former tenant holdings of Etloe
Duchy manor. A dwelling by Lanes brook on
the south-west boundary, probably at a small
green beside the old course of the Gloucester-
Chepstow turnpike, <a href="#fnn158" name="anchorn158">(fn. 158)</a> was recorded in 1635, <a href="#fnn159" name="anchorn159">(fn. 159)</a> 
and in the same area a building called Chesterley, possibly on a Roman site, was mentioned in
1656. <a href="#fnn160" name="anchorn160">(fn. 160)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p25"> </a>The riverside hamlet of Gatcombe, from
which a busy trade was once carried on, <a href="#fnn161" name="anchorn161">(fn. 161)</a> 
stands by a pill at the end of a long wooded
coombe. There was at least one dwelling
there by 1495, <a href="#fnn162" name="anchorn162">(fn. 162)</a> and in 1583 it was a hamlet
of six or seven houses, which size it has
remained. In the 1580s its only wealthy resident was said to be a 'Mr. Borough', <a href="#fnn163" name="anchorn163">(fn. 163)</a> 
presumably a successor of Richard Barrow
who had a house there in 1547. <a href="#fnn164" name="anchorn164">(fn. 164)</a> Barrow's
house was possibly on the site of that on the
east side of the hamlet, close to the riverside,
which became known as Drake's House from
a tradition, uncorroborated and recorded only
from the late 19th century, that Sir Francis
Drake visited Gatcombe. <a href="#fnn165" name="anchorn165">(fn. 165)</a> In 1763 the house
was probably the inn called the Gatcombe
Boat <a href="#fnn166" name="anchorn166">(fn. 166)</a> and by 1792 it was certainly an inn, known
then and in the 1830s as both the Sloop and the
Ship. <a href="#fnn167" name="anchorn167">(fn. 167)</a> It remained open as the Sloop inn in 1879
but closed before 1901. <a href="#fnn168" name="anchorn168">(fn. 168)</a> Drake's House was
built <em>c</em>. 1600 as two floors with attics which were
later raised to make a full third storey. <a href="#fnn169" name="anchorn169">(fn. 169)</a> The
ground floor may originally have been used for
storeage, and the upper floors are reached by a
newel stair next to the main doorway. The plan
of the upper floors is a large central room with
one or two smaller rooms at each end. All the
internal walls are of well-finished plank and
muntin. In the early 19th century another inn,
also having the sign of the Ship, was kept at a
house which stands on the west side and slightly
higher up the hamlet. That inn was a copyhold
under Etloe Duchy manor and was the meeting
place of the manor court in 1821, becoming
known as the Court House after it closed as an
inn, probably in the late 1820s or soon afterwards. <a href="#fnn170" name="anchorn170">(fn. 170)</a> The Court House, though largely of the
19th century, incorporates an early 17th-century
range, which includes a room with moulded and
chamfered beams.</p>
		<p><a name="p26"> </a>Oatfield Farm, standing above Gatcombe
but connected to it by an old hollow way,
was apparently the home of Richard Hooper
(d. 1639) of Gatcombe; <a href="#fnn171" name="anchorn171">(fn. 171)</a> it was owned by the
Hooper family in the early 18th century, later
passing into the Hagloe estate. <a href="#fnn172" name="anchorn172">(fn. 172)</a> The house is
a substantial rubble-walled farmhouse of the
early 17th century with a lateral stack to the
central room, which is flanked by cross passages. To the east there is a two-roomed cross
wing and to the west an unheated room which
was probably for storeage. There are 19th- and
20th-century additions along the south side and
at the north-east corner. Oatfield Farm was sold
by the Hagloe estate in 1976 and was extensively
restored by its new owner, who also converted
a large barn as a conference centre and holiday
flats. <a href="#fnn173" name="anchorn173">(fn. 173)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p27"> </a>Blakeney village grew up on the Gloucester-
Chepstow road around the junction of the
Soudley and Blackpool brooks, which powered
a number of mills in and around the settlement.
The village was large enough to have a chapel
of ease by the mid 16th century and in 1583 it
was said to contain 20 or 30 households. <a href="#fnn174" name="anchorn174">(fn. 174)</a> About
1775 Blakeney tithing, which included only the
north part of the village, was said to be the most
populous of the tithings, with 50 families. <a href="#fnn175" name="anchorn175">(fn. 175)</a> As
a fairly populous village on the main through
route and a centre for trade, Blakeney rather
than the isolated Awre village became the principal focus of parish life. Blakeney's chapel came
to attract larger congregations than the parish
church, <a href="#fnn176" name="anchorn176">(fn. 176)</a> the court of the manor of Awre and
Etloe was usually held at one of its inns in the
18th century, <a href="#fnn177" name="anchorn177">(fn. 177)</a> and by the 1770s the parish
vestry usually met in the village. The vestry
meetings were held in the church house <a href="#fnn178" name="anchorn178">(fn. 178)</a> adjoining the chapel until the house, which also served
as an inn called the Bird in Hand, was demolished to make room for the enlargement of the
chapel in 1819. <a href="#fnn179" name="anchorn179">(fn. 179)</a> The oldest part of the village
was presumably the most concentrated group of
buildings, in the area called Church Square
(actually triangular in shape) in the centre of
which the chapel stands. Houses had begun to
extend south-westwards along the main road
into the part later known as Bridge Street by
1624 when a house by Soudley brook was described as in Blakeney Street. <a href="#fnn180" name="anchorn180">(fn. 180)</a> Blackpool brook
formed a principal feature of Bridge Street,
flowing alongside it for its whole length and
crossing at one point from the north-west to the
south-east side. <a href="#fnn181" name="anchorn181">(fn. 181)</a> The public bridges at Blakeney
which the parish repaired in 1688 <a href="#fnn182" name="anchorn182">(fn. 182)</a> were presumably that known as the town bridge across
Blackpool brook and another below, across
Soudley brook. In 1790 both were packhorse
bridges no more than 5 ft. wide and the parish
petitioned the county magistrates to meet part
of the cost of rebuilding the lower one to a width
of 21 ft. to take vehicles. <a href="#fnn183" name="anchorn183">(fn. 183)</a> Blackpool brook was
culverted in the north-east part of Bridge Street
in the early 20th century. <a href="#fnn184" name="anchorn184">(fn. 184)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p28"> </a>The oldest surviving house in Blakeney, the
former Swan inn, stands east of Church Square
at the foot of Swan Lane, which until 1831 was
the course of the main road. <a href="#fnn185" name="anchorn185">(fn. 185)</a> The building,
which dates from the 16th century, has a main
block and cross wing and is partly of exposed
timber framing; it was restored <em>c</em>. 1985. <a href="#fnn186" name="anchorn186">(fn. 186)</a> It was
an inn in 1645 <a href="#fnn187" name="anchorn187">(fn. 187)</a> and until the 1870s when it
became a temperance hotel; it apparently closed
in the early 20th century. <a href="#fnn188" name="anchorn188">(fn. 188)</a> The houses around
Church Square were mostly built or rebuilt in
the late 18th century and comprise fairly substantial, if plain, dwellings of brick or stone,
often rendered. A building opposite the Swan at
the entrance to the Awre road had taken over
the sign of the Bird in Hand inn from the former
church house by 1825 <a href="#fnn189" name="anchorn189">(fn. 189)</a> and remained an inn
until the mid 20th century. <a href="#fnn190" name="anchorn190">(fn. 190)</a> The Yew Tree inn
west of the chapel had opened by 1817. <a href="#fnn191" name="anchorn191">(fn. 191)</a> Bridge
Street, which is less closely built up than Church
Square, includes a small 17th-century farmhouse on the north-west side and the late
18th-century King's Head inn on the south-east
side, but most of the other houses are late
19th-century buildings in the dark Forest sandstone. The most prominent is Sydenham House,
south-west of the King's Head, a substantial
<strong>L</strong>-shaped building. By 1876 it was the home and
trading premises of Alfred Butler, a grocer,
draper, and miller, <a href="#fnn192" name="anchorn192">(fn. 192)</a> who had perhaps built it.</p>
		<p><a name="p29"> </a>In the late 18th century and the early 19th,
probably the period of Blakeney's greatest prosperity, the village was enlarged by the building of
stone cottages on Awre Road leading south-east
from Church Square, on Lowfield Lane (later
renamed Church Way) leading north from the
square, and on Millend Lane leading south from
Bridge Street to Millend, where there were already
a few houses grouped around a corn mill by the
1740s. <a href="#fnn193" name="anchorn193">(fn. 193)</a> A small estate of council houses was
built in 1949 at Highfield on the west side of the
Ayleford road, and others were built in the 1950s
on All Saints Road, north of Church Square,
and on Awre Road. <a href="#fnn194" name="anchorn194">(fn. 194)</a> A few private houses were
added in various parts of the village before 1989.</p>
		<p><a name="p30"> </a>South-west of Blakeney the small roadside
hamlet of Nibley had been established by the
early 17th century, <a href="#fnn195" name="anchorn195">(fn. 195)</a> with a corn mill at the
bottom of the Blackpool brook valley one of
the earliest buildings. <a href="#fnn196" name="anchorn196">(fn. 196)</a> Nibley Farm (in 1989
called Old Nibley Farmhouse) on the southeast side of the road was recorded from 1678 <a href="#fnn197" name="anchorn197">(fn. 197)</a> 
but was rebuilt <em>c</em>. 1800. An innkeeper of
Nibley who died in 1732 <a href="#fnn198" name="anchorn198">(fn. 198)</a> may have kept the
Cock inn. That inn had certainly opened by
1822 when it was a staging post for a South
Wales coach. <a href="#fnn199" name="anchorn199">(fn. 199)</a> At the south end of Nibley green,
a narrow roadside green extending from Nibley
to the junction with the Purton turnpike, a small
cottage called Cracked Croft was built before
1741; <a href="#fnn200" name="anchorn200">(fn. 200)</a> a larger new house was added to it in the
early 19th century and was known as Nibley
House in 1989. There was a dwelling at Viney
on the road from Nibley green to Viney Hill by
1603, <a href="#fnn201" name="anchorn201">(fn. 201)</a> and two small farmhouses, Upper Viney
which may date from the 17th century and
Lower Viney which is dated 1741, stand there.
The Hayes, south of Viney Hill, was the manor
house of Blakeney manor. <a href="#fnn202" name="anchorn202">(fn. 202)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p31"> </a>In 1327 57 people were assessed for the subsidy under Awre 'with its members' and 5 under
Blakeney. <a href="#fnn203" name="anchorn203">(fn. 203)</a> There were said to be <em>c</em>. 420 communicants in the parish in 1551, <a href="#fnn204" name="anchorn204">(fn. 204)</a> 133
households in 1563, <a href="#fnn205" name="anchorn205">(fn. 205)</a> and 250 families in 1650. <a href="#fnn206" name="anchorn206">(fn. 206)</a> 
About 1710 the population was estimated at <em>c</em>.
700 in 139 houses, <a href="#fnn207" name="anchorn207">(fn. 207)</a> and 952 people in 191
houses were enumerated in 1801. In 1811, out
of a total population of 1,035, 346 lived in
Blakeney tithing, 332 in Etloe with Etloe Duchy,
194 in Awre, 99 in Bledisloe, and 64 in Hagloe;
the figures for Blakeney and Etloe suggest that
Blakeney village, straddling the boundary between the two, then had a population of around
550. The population of the parish rose to 1,526
by 1861 and there was then a fairly sharp fall to
1,179 by 1881, followed by a more gradual fall
to 1,070 by 1911. It then remained fairly static
until 1951 when it was 1,033. Following the
addition of the Blakeney Hill area to the parish
in 1953, the population was 1,805 in 1961, falling
to 1,527 by 1981. <a href="#fnn208" name="anchorn208">(fn. 208)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p32"> </a>A gas company was formed for Blakeney before 1876 with its works beside the railway at
Nibley. <a href="#fnn209" name="anchorn209">(fn. 209)</a> It was apparently absorbed by the
Lydney gas company in the late 1930s. <a href="#fnn210" name="anchorn210">(fn. 210)</a> Blakeney's street-lighting committee mentioned in
1906 <a href="#fnn211" name="anchorn211">(fn. 211)</a> presumably lit the village streets with gas.
Other services for Blakeney were not provided
until the mid 20th century. Electricity was laid
on to the village by the West Gloucestershire
Power Co. in the mid 1930s. <a href="#fnn212" name="anchorn212">(fn. 212)</a> Its houses remained dependent on wells for water <a href="#fnn213" name="anchorn213">(fn. 213)</a> until the
early 1950s when they were supplied under a
scheme of the East Dean rural district from a
reservoir on Blakeney hill. <a href="#fnn214" name="anchorn214">(fn. 214)</a> Some drains had
been built by the 1860s <a href="#fnn215" name="anchorn215">(fn. 215)</a> but in 1908 some houses
discharged sewage into the stream running
through the village. Refuse disposal remained
the responsibility of the individual householders <a href="#fnn216" name="anchorn216">(fn. 216)</a> until 1937 when the rural district extended
that service to Awre parish. <a href="#fnn217" name="anchorn217">(fn. 217)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p33"> </a>Blakeney had a friendly society, meeting at the
Swan inn, by 1791, <a href="#fnn218" name="anchorn218">(fn. 218)</a> and a lodge of the Oddfellows was founded in the village <em>c</em>. 1824. A brass
band formed in the village before 1843 <a href="#fnn219" name="anchorn219">(fn. 219)</a> was in
regular demand for events in the Forest area
during the mid 19th century. <a href="#fnn220" name="anchorn220">(fn. 220)</a> The village's old
National school at the bottom of Lowfield Lane
was in use as a public library in 1879. <a href="#fnn221" name="anchorn221">(fn. 221)</a> In 1905
the building was vested in trustees for church
purposes <a href="#fnn222" name="anchorn222">(fn. 222)</a> and it remained in use as a church
hall in 1989. A new village hall in Millend Lane
was provided before 1927 as a memorial to the
dead of the First World War. <a href="#fnn223" name="anchorn223">(fn. 223)</a> It had been
demolished by 1989 when a community centre,
recently built beside a playing field on the north
side of the village, housed most social events. In
Awre village the school, closed in 1927, <a href="#fnn224" name="anchorn224">(fn. 224)</a> was
later used as a village hall.</p>
		<p><a name="p34"> </a>Awre parish was usually without large resident
landowners and its leading inhabitants were
members of long-established yeoman families,
including the A Deanes, Birkins, Trippetts,
Hopkinses, Bayleys, Keddicks, Drivers, and a
family that took its surname from the place. <a href="#fnn225" name="anchorn225">(fn. 225)</a> 
The Awres, who as late as the 1680s sometimes
used the style 'of Awre', <a href="#fnn226" name="anchorn226">(fn. 226)</a> were still represented
in Awre village in 1989. During the 17th and
18th centuries, presumably because of the close
connexion through the river trade, a large number of Bristol men owned land in the parish and
many of Awre's inhabitants had relations in that
city. <a href="#fnn227" name="anchorn227">(fn. 227)</a> 
		</p>
		<p><a name="p35"> </a>A note inserted in the Awre parish register,
probably in the late 17th century, claimed that
Thomas Sternhold and John Hopkins, who produced the first English metrical versions of the
psalms, published in 1551, both lived in the
parish, the former at Hawfield and the latter at
Woodend. Although Sternholds and Hopkinses
were both well represented in the parish in the
16th century, no contemporary connexion of the
two men with the place has been discovered. <a href="#fnn228" name="anchorn228">(fn. 228)</a>

			<h3 id="h3-0002">MANORS AND OTHER ESTATES.</h3>
			<p><a name="p36"> </a>In 1066
Edward the Confessor held the manor of
<em>AWRE</em>, assessed at 5 hides and contributing half
a night's maintenance to the farm of the county,
but Alwig the sheriff had separated from the
manor three members, Purton in Lydney, Etloe,
and Bledisloe, a total of 7 hides, and removed
them from the farm. <a href="#fnn229" name="anchorn229">(fn. 229)</a> The manor remained in
royal hands until the reign of Stephen when it
passed to Miles of Gloucester, earl of Hereford, <a href="#fnn230" name="anchorn230">(fn. 230)</a> 
and Robert son of Hugh held it by knight service
from Miles (d. 1143) and his son Roger, earl of
Hereford. Robert became a monk of Monmouth
priory <a href="#fnn231" name="anchorn231">(fn. 231)</a> and the manor apparently then reverted
to Earl Roger. Awre was among former royal
demesne estates between the Severn and the
Wye which Henry II confirmed to the earl in
1154 or 1155, <a href="#fnn232" name="anchorn232">(fn. 232)</a> and following the earl's rebellion
and death in 1155 it was granted to his brother
Walter. <a href="#fnn233" name="anchorn233">(fn. 233)</a> On Walter's death <em>c</em>. 1160 the manor
reverted to the Crown, <a href="#fnn234" name="anchorn234">(fn. 234)</a> which retained it in
hand for the remainder of the century; <a href="#fnn235" name="anchorn235">(fn. 235)</a> it was
among the estates in which Henry de Bohun,
heir to the earls of Hereford, was required to
quitclaim all his rights when created earl in
1200. <a href="#fnn236" name="anchorn236">(fn. 236)</a>

			<p><a name="p37"> </a>In 1204 the Crown granted the manor at farm
for life to Walter of Awre the elder (d. <em>c</em>. 1221). <a href="#fnn237" name="anchorn237">(fn. 237)</a> 
In 1230 it was granted at fee farm to William
Marshal, earl of Pembroke, and his heirs. <a href="#fnn238" name="anchorn238">(fn. 238)</a> On
William's death in 1231 it passed to his brother
Richard <a href="#fnn239" name="anchorn239">(fn. 239)</a> and then in turn to his brothers Gilbert, <a href="#fnn240" name="anchorn240">(fn. 240)</a> Walter, and Anselm (d. 1245). Anselm's
widow Maud, who married Roger de Quincy,
earl of Winchester, held the manor in dower
until her death in 1252. <a href="#fnn241" name="anchorn241">(fn. 241)</a> The manor was then
subject to partition among the families of Anselm Marshal's sisters and coheirs. <a href="#fnn242" name="anchorn242">(fn. 242)</a> An estate
described as half the manor was held in 1276 by
William de Valence, <a href="#fnn243" name="anchorn243">(fn. 243)</a> who had married Joan,
daughter of one of Anselm's sisters, and Joan (d.
1307) probably retained it after William's death
in 1296. <a href="#fnn244" name="anchorn244">(fn. 244)</a> Before 1316 their son Aymer de
Valence, earl of Pembroke, granted that estate
to Maurice of Berkeley. <a href="#fnn245" name="anchorn245">(fn. 245)</a> Another estate called
half the manor was held at his death in 1262 by
Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester, who was
son of Isabel, another of Anselm Marshal's
sisters. <a href="#fnn246" name="anchorn246">(fn. 246)</a> Richard's widow Maud (d. <em>c</em>. 1288) held
the estate in dower in 1276. <a href="#fnn247" name="anchorn247">(fn. 247)</a> In 1280 Richard's
son Gilbert de Clare granted it, possibly in
reversion on Maud's death, to Roger Mortimer <a href="#fnn248" name="anchorn248">(fn. 248)</a> 
(d. 1282), <a href="#fnn249" name="anchorn249">(fn. 249)</a> who had married Maud de Breuse,
heir to another of Anselm Marshal's sisters.
Maud Mortimer retained the estate <a href="#fnn250" name="anchorn250">(fn. 250)</a> until her
death in 1301 when she was succeeded by her
son Edmund <a href="#fnn251" name="anchorn251">(fn. 251)</a> (d. 1304). <a href="#fnn252" name="anchorn252">(fn. 252)</a> Edmund's widow
Margaret held the estate, then described as a
third of the manor, in 1316 <a href="#fnn253" name="anchorn253">(fn. 253)</a> but had perhaps
surrendered it by 1320 when her son Roger
Mortimer settled it on the marriage of his daughter Margaret and Thomas of Berkeley. <a href="#fnn254" name="anchorn254">(fn. 254)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p38"> </a>In 1278 when William de Valence and Gilbert
de Clare made an agreement about the advowson
of Awre church claims were entered by John de
Bohun and William Paynell. <a href="#fnn255" name="anchorn255">(fn. 255)</a> The two men,
who presumably claimed as other heirs of Anselm Marshal, apparently secured parts of the
manor, for <em>c</em>. 1300 William Paynell granted lands
and the rents and services of tenants at Awre,
together with the reversion of lands held in dower
by Joan, widow of John de Bohun of Midhurst
(Suss.), to Thomas of Berkeley, Lord Berkeley (d.
1321). Thomas had a quitclaim from Joan of her
rights in 1308. <a href="#fnn256" name="anchorn256">(fn. 256)</a> Thomas's son Maurice of
Berkeley (d. 1326), <a href="#fnn257" name="anchorn257">(fn. 257)</a> who bought Aymer de Valence's share of the manor, granted an estate,
apparently comprising tenants' rents in Awre and
Etloe, to his own third son John for life, <a href="#fnn258" name="anchorn258">(fn. 258)</a> and by
1319 Maurice had apparently transferred his manorial rights and the rest of his estate to his eldest
son Thomas. In 1319 the younger Thomas also
obtained a lease of his grandfather's land at
Awre, <a href="#fnn259" name="anchorn259">(fn. 259)</a> and the following year he added the
Mortimers' share of the manor to his estate. The
lands of the younger Thomas of Berkeley and
his brother John were forfeited to the Crown as
a result of the family's involvement in the
rebellion of 1322. <a href="#fnn260" name="anchorn260">(fn. 260)</a> Thomas was restored to his
lands in 1327, <a href="#fnn261" name="anchorn261">(fn. 261)</a> and the whole manor was united
in his possession after the death of his brother
in 1332 or 1333. <a href="#fnn262" name="anchorn262">(fn. 262)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p39"> </a>Thomas, Lord Berkeley, died in 1361 and
was succeeded by his son Maurice <a href="#fnn263" name="anchorn263">(fn. 263)</a> (d.
1368). <a href="#fnn264" name="anchorn264">(fn. 264)</a> The manor was held by Maurice's
widow Elizabeth <a href="#fnn265" name="anchorn265">(fn. 265)</a> (d. 1389), passing to his
son Thomas <a href="#fnn266" name="anchorn266">(fn. 266)</a> (d. 1417). It then descended
to Thomas's daughter Elizabeth and her
husband Richard Beauchamp (d. 1439), earl
of Warwick, <a href="#fnn267" name="anchorn267">(fn. 267)</a> and in 1445, like the associated
Bledisloe hundred, it was presumably held
jointly by their three daughters, Margaret,
wife of John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury,
Eleanor, wife of Edmund Beaufort, marquess of Dorset, and Elizabeth, wife of
George Neville, Lord Latimer. <a href="#fnn268" name="anchorn268">(fn. 268)</a> All rights
eventually passed to the Latimers, and Elizabeth, who after her husband's death in 1469
married Thomas Wake, held Awre manor at
her death in 1480. She was succeeded by her
grandson Richard Neville, Lord Latimer,
then a minor. From Richard <a href="#fnn269" name="anchorn269">(fn. 269)</a> (d. 1530) the
manor presumably passed to his son John (d.
1543), <a href="#fnn270" name="anchorn270">(fn. 270)</a> whose son John (d. 1577), Lord
Latimer, held it in 1555. <a href="#fnn271" name="anchorn271">(fn. 271)</a> The last John was
succeeded by his daughter Catherine, who
married Henry Percy (d. 1585), earl of Northumberland. <a href="#fnn272" name="anchorn272">(fn. 272)</a> Catherine and her second
husband Francis Fitton sold the manor in 1595
to Sir Edward Winter of Lydney. <a href="#fnn273" name="anchorn273">(fn. 273)</a> From Sir
Edward (d. 1619) it passed with Lydney to his
son Sir John, who in the course of his attempts
to clear his estates of the heavy financial burden
imposed on them following the Civil War <a href="#fnn274" name="anchorn274">(fn. 274)</a> 
alienated some of the tenant land in 1656. <a href="#fnn275" name="anchorn275">(fn. 275)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p40"> </a>In 1668 Sir John Winter, his sons William and
Charles, and his mortgagees sold Awre manor
to Gloucester corporation, which acquired it in
trust as the endowment of Sir Thomas Rich's
school in that city. The manor, which by that
time was usually called the manor of <em>AWRE
AND ETLOE</em>, comprised the demesne farms of
Lypiatt and Whitescourt, the rents and fines of
numerous tenants in Awre, Etloe, Blakeney, and
Bledisloe, and valuable fishing rights. Also in
1668 the corporation bought Box farm for the
same purpose, and in 1749 Maiden Hall farm
and in 1766 Hall farm were added to the trust
estate. <a href="#fnn276" name="anchorn276">(fn. 276)</a> In 1836 the manor passed from
Gloucester corporation to the city's municipal
charity trustees and in 1882 it passed to the
governors of the Gloucester United Schools. <a href="#fnn277" name="anchorn277">(fn. 277)</a> 
In 1921 the governors were empowered to sell
Hall Farm and 364 a. of land, <a href="#fnn278" name="anchorn278">(fn. 278)</a> and at the same
period they sold Box farm <a href="#fnn279" name="anchorn279">(fn. 279)</a> and enfranchised
the small amount of copyhold surviving. Of the
few remaining manorial assets, the chief rents
were redeemed in 1926. <a href="#fnn280" name="anchorn280">(fn. 280)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p41"> </a>There was possibly no manor house on Awre
manor before 1327 when Thomas, Lord
Berkeley, built one there, bringing oaks across
the river from his estate at Hurst, in Slimbridge. <a href="#fnn281" name="anchorn281">(fn. 281)</a> It was presumably the house later
called the Lypiatt, which stood on Marsh Lane
east of Awre church and was regarded as the
manor house in the 17th century. <a href="#fnn282" name="anchorn282">(fn. 282)</a> In 1796 the
Lypiatt was a stone-built house of 10 rooms. <a href="#fnn283" name="anchorn283">(fn. 283)</a> 
It was demolished in the mid 19th century,
before 1879. <a href="#fnn284" name="anchorn284">(fn. 284)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p42"> </a>The manor of <em>ETLOE</em>, severed from Awre
manor before the Conquest, was held in 1086
by Roger of Berkeley. <a href="#fnn285" name="anchorn285">(fn. 285)</a> That manor appears to
have been absorbed once more into Awre manor
by the the beginning of the 14th century:
Maurice of Berkeley had lands at Etloe <em>c</em>. 1316,
presumably acquired with his portion of Awre, <a href="#fnn286" name="anchorn286">(fn. 286)</a> 
and his father Thomas acquired an estate at
Etloe, described as within Awre manor, from
Thomas Hatholf in 1317. <a href="#fnn287" name="anchorn287">(fn. 287)</a> Maurice, Lord
Berkeley, bought other lands there in 1366 or
1367. <a href="#fnn288" name="anchorn288">(fn. 288)</a> Later Awre manor was thought to include the whole of Etloe tithing, which was
occupied mainly by customary tenements held
from the manor. <a href="#fnn289" name="anchorn289">(fn. 289)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p43"> </a>A manor later called <em>ETLOE DUCHY</em> was
perhaps represented by the ploughland at Etloe
with which Walter Goscelin was dealing in
1248. <a href="#fnn290" name="anchorn290">(fn. 290)</a> The manor belonged to Patrick de Chaworth who died <em>c</em>. 1283, leaving as his heir an
infant daughter Maud, <a href="#fnn291" name="anchorn291">(fn. 291)</a> and in 1305 Maud's
husband Henry, earl of Lancaster, owned the
manor. <a href="#fnn292" name="anchorn292">(fn. 292)</a> Henry (d. 1345) was succeeded by his
son Henry, who was created duke of Lancaster
in 1351 and died in 1361. <a href="#fnn293" name="anchorn293">(fn. 293)</a> At the partition of
the duke's estates Etloe was assigned to his
daughter Maud <a href="#fnn294" name="anchorn294">(fn. 294)</a> and following her death in
1362 probably passed to her sister Blanche, wife
of John of Gaunt, and then to their son, the
future Henry IV. <a href="#fnn295" name="anchorn295">(fn. 295)</a> The Crown held the manor
in 1415 <a href="#fnn296" name="anchorn296">(fn. 296)</a> and retained it <a href="#fnn297" name="anchorn297">(fn. 297)</a> until 1609 when it was
sold to George Salter and John Williams. <a href="#fnn298" name="anchorn298">(fn. 298)</a> It
apparently then descended with Minsterworth
manor: <a href="#fnn299" name="anchorn299">(fn. 299)</a> John Chamberlayne held it at his death
in 1628, having devised it to his nephew Thomas
Wyndham, <a href="#fnn300" name="anchorn300">(fn. 300)</a> Thomas Pury of Taynton owned it
in 1669, <a href="#fnn301" name="anchorn301">(fn. 301)</a> William Burgess was dealing with it
in 1724, <a href="#fnn302" name="anchorn302">(fn. 302)</a> and by the 1770s it belonged to
Charles Barrow of Highgrove, Minsterworth. <a href="#fnn303" name="anchorn303">(fn. 303)</a> 
At his death in 1789 Barrow was succeeded by
his illegitimate daughter Mary Caroline (d.
1837), who married Charles Evans (d. 1819), and
their son Edmund Barrow Evans (d. 1868) <a href="#fnn304" name="anchorn304">(fn. 304)</a> 
owned it in 1866. <a href="#fnn305" name="anchorn305">(fn. 305)</a> The manor has not been
found recorded later.</p>
			<p><a name="p44"> </a>The manor of <em>BLEDISLOE</em>, severed from
Awre manor before the Conquest, was held in
1086 by William son of Baderon. <a href="#fnn306" name="anchorn306">(fn. 306)</a> It was presumably the estate that Roger of Bledisloe held
for ¼ knight's fee from Alan Plucknett in 1285 <a href="#fnn307" name="anchorn307">(fn. 307)</a> 
and that John Billing held in 1346. <a href="#fnn308" name="anchorn308">(fn. 308)</a> Later it was
held by John Greyndour (d. 1416), <a href="#fnn309" name="anchorn309">(fn. 309)</a> and it then
descended with Abenhall manor in the Baynham
and Vaughan families <a href="#fnn310" name="anchorn310">(fn. 310)</a> until 1664 when John
Vaughan and Frances his wife conveyed it to
Thomas Bridgeman and John Horne. <a href="#fnn311" name="anchorn311">(fn. 311)</a> It
apparently passed to Frances Bridgeman,
whose children Thomas Bridgeman and Elizabeth Griffith sold it before 1671 to William
Rowles of Cockshoot, in Newnham. Rowles
settled it in 1680 on the marriage of his daughter
Elizabeth and William Scudamore the younger,
of Gloucester, and they sold it in 1682 to John
Birkin of Hagloe. <a href="#fnn312" name="anchorn312">(fn. 312)</a> It then descended with the
Hagloe estate and was sold to the Crown with
that estate in 1853. <a href="#fnn313" name="anchorn313">(fn. 313)</a> The manor house and
demesne land were possibly retained by John
Vaughan when he sold the manor, for he owned
an unidentified farm at Bledisloe in 1688. <a href="#fnn314" name="anchorn314">(fn. 314)</a> At the
beginning of the 18th century Bledisloe farm
belonged to the Bellamy family, <a href="#fnn315" name="anchorn315">(fn. 315)</a> which retained
it until the 1790s. <a href="#fnn316" name="anchorn316">(fn. 316)</a> At the beginning of the 19th
century the house with <em>c</em>. 160 a. of land belonged
to Thomas Barber, owner of the nearby Hawfield estate, <a href="#fnn317" name="anchorn317">(fn. 317)</a> and in 1839 the farm was owned by
Sophia Morse. <a href="#fnn318" name="anchorn318">(fn. 318)</a> In the late 1950s the farm was
bought by Mr. R. R. Baber, of a family that was
prominent as farmers in the parish during the
20th century, and in 1989 he owned and farmed
it with Hall farm, near Awre village. <a href="#fnn319" name="anchorn319">(fn. 319)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p45"> </a>The manor house, at Bledisloe Farm on Chicknalls Lane, was described <em>c</em>. 1700 as 'now mean
as to building'. <a href="#fnn320" name="anchorn320">(fn. 320)</a> It was replaced by a new
farmhouse <em>c</em>. 1800, <a href="#fnn321" name="anchorn321">(fn. 321)</a> a two-storeyed building of
brick on a plinth of blocks of industrial slag, with
low, stone-built service ranges at the rear. Possibly associated with the site of the manor was
a mound which occupied a low ridge to the south
of the farmhouse. Excavation in 1964, shortly
before the mound was levelled, found evidence
of an early timber structure, which the mound
replaced in the 12th century, possibly as the
motte of a small castle which was left uncompleted; a domestic or farm building was built on
the mound later in the Middle Ages. <a href="#fnn322" name="anchorn322">(fn. 322)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p46"> </a>Soon after the Conquest William FitzOsbern
formed a single estate of Nass and Purton, in
Lydney, and a third manor called Pontune. <a href="#fnn323" name="anchorn323">(fn. 323)</a> 
Pontune can be identified with the manor of
<em>POULTON</em> in Awre, which later formed a
separate estate, held under the earls of Warwick,
overlords of the Lydney manors. <a href="#fnn324" name="anchorn324">(fn. 324)</a> It was evidently held in the late 12th century by Roger
son of Ralph of Poulton who granted 3 yardlands
to Flaxley abbey and also made the abbey another gift for the benefit of the souls of William
(d. 1184), earl of Warwick, and his countess; <a href="#fnn325" name="anchorn325">(fn. 325)</a> 
the abbey held the land at Poulton until the
Dissolution when it passed with Flaxley manor
to the Kingston family. <a href="#fnn326" name="anchorn326">(fn. 326)</a> In 1221 Ralph son of
Ralph conveyed two ploughlands at Poulton to
Ralph of Willington, <a href="#fnn327" name="anchorn327">(fn. 327)</a> whose widow Olympia <a href="#fnn328" name="anchorn328">(fn. 328)</a> 
held Poulton manor from the earl of Warwick
for 1 knight's fee in 1242; <a href="#fnn329" name="anchorn329">(fn. 329)</a> the overlordship of
the earls was recorded until 1349. <a href="#fnn330" name="anchorn330">(fn. 330)</a> Ralph of
Willington, son of Ralph, held Poulton from
1260, <a href="#fnn331" name="anchorn331">(fn. 331)</a> and in 1303 it was held by John de Lisle
and his wife Joan. <a href="#fnn332" name="anchorn332">(fn. 332)</a> John of Willington held it
in 1311 <a href="#fnn333" name="anchorn333">(fn. 333)</a> and was succeeded at his death <em>c</em>. 1338
by his son Ralph. <a href="#fnn334" name="anchorn334">(fn. 334)</a> The manor then descended
as Westonbirt manor until the attainder of the
duke of Somerset in 1552. <a href="#fnn335" name="anchorn335">(fn. 335)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p47"> </a>In 1555 the Crown sold Poulton manor to
William Bridgeman of Mitcheldean and Richard
Wilson of Ledbury (Herefs.), <a href="#fnn336" name="anchorn336">(fn. 336)</a> but later it may
have made a grant of the manor, with Westonbirt, for the benefit of Arthur Basset, who
conveyed Poulton to Bridgeman and Wilson and
the heirs of Bridgeman in 1567. <a href="#fnn337" name="anchorn337">(fn. 337)</a> Bridgeman and
Wilson apparently made a partition of the estate
under which the former took the manor house,
called Poulton Court, the demesne land, and the
manorial rights, while the latter took the customary tenements. <a href="#fnn338" name="anchorn338">(fn. 338)</a> Wilson sold at least three,
and perhaps all, of the customary tenements to
the tenants in 1568, <a href="#fnn339" name="anchorn339">(fn. 339)</a> while Bridgeman held
Poulton Court and the demesne lands at his
death in 1581 <a href="#fnn340" name="anchorn340">(fn. 340)</a> and his successors to that estate
exercised the manorial rights in the 18th and
19th centuries. <a href="#fnn341" name="anchorn341">(fn. 341)</a> William Bridgeman was succeeded by his son Thomas, and Thomas (d.
1607) by his son Charles, <a href="#fnn342" name="anchorn342">(fn. 342)</a> apparently the Charles Bridgeman of Littledean who died in 1643. <a href="#fnn343" name="anchorn343">(fn. 343)</a> 
Poulton Court descended to Charles's son Charles (d. 1647), and the second Charles's son
Charles <a href="#fnn344" name="anchorn344">(fn. 344)</a> (d. 1680) <a href="#fnn345" name="anchorn345">(fn. 345)</a> held it in 1667. <a href="#fnn346" name="anchorn346">(fn. 346)</a> John
Gainsford held Poulton Court as owner or tenant in 1682 and until his death in 1688. <a href="#fnn347" name="anchorn347">(fn. 347)</a> At the
beginning of the 18th century, when a branch
of the Birkin family occupied the house as
tenants, <a href="#fnn348" name="anchorn348">(fn. 348)</a> Poulton Court was owned by a Mr.
Blackwell of Bristol. <a href="#fnn349" name="anchorn349">(fn. 349)</a> In 1733 it was owned by
Jonathan Blackwell <a href="#fnn350" name="anchorn350">(fn. 350)</a> (d. <em>c</em>. 1754) of Northaw
(Herts.), who was succeeded by his adopted heir
Samuel Killican, who had changed his name to
Blackwell. <a href="#fnn351" name="anchorn351">(fn. 351)</a> In 1766 Samuel Blackwell, then of
Williamstrip, in Coln St. Aldwyns, sold Poulton
Court with the Ledge and Merryway farms to
James Thomas of Oatfield. <a href="#fnn352" name="anchorn352">(fn. 352)</a> It then descended
as part of the Hagloe estate to the Crown <a href="#fnn353" name="anchorn353">(fn. 353)</a> and
remained a farm on that estate in 1989. The
medieval dwelling at Poulton Court was presumably within the circular moat which survives
there. The present house has a main range with
a tall 17th-century, gabled stone front. At the
back a wing with a two-storeyed porch has been
much altered but may represent an earlier hall,
with service accommodation beyond the hall.</p>
			<p><a name="p48"> </a>A small estate called the manor of <em>BLAKENEY</em> was evidently the part of Blakeney tithing
later regarded as within St. Briavels hundred: <a href="#fnn354" name="anchorn354">(fn. 354)</a> 
in common with other manors of the hundred
it was held from St. Briavels castle for an annual
rent and by the service as woodward of a
bailiwick in the royal demesne lands of the
Forest. <a href="#fnn355" name="anchorn355">(fn. 355)</a> The bailiwick of Blakeney was recorded in the custody of the lord of the manor
from 1199, <a href="#fnn356" name="anchorn356">(fn. 356)</a> but in 1250 it was forfeited to the
Crown. <a href="#fnn357" name="anchorn357">(fn. 357)</a> Before 1282 the bailiwick was granted,
apparently in fee, to Walter of Aston, <a href="#fnn358" name="anchorn358">(fn. 358)</a> but in
the 14th century it was granted to other custodians for life or during pleasure. <a href="#fnn359" name="anchorn359">(fn. 359)</a> In 1486 it was
granted in free alms to Llanthony priory,
Gloucester. <a href="#fnn360" name="anchorn360">(fn. 360)</a> By 1565 the bailiwick had been
returned to the lords of Blakeney manor, <a href="#fnn361" name="anchorn361">(fn. 361)</a> who
remained woodwards until the office lapsed in
the mid 19th century. <a href="#fnn362" name="anchorn362">(fn. 362)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p49"> </a>Blakeney manor was held by Adam of Blakeney before 1196 when his widow Basile had
custody of his lands and heir. <a href="#fnn363" name="anchorn363">(fn. 363)</a> She was evidently the 'lady of Blakeney' who held Blakeney
bailiwick in 1199. <a href="#fnn364" name="anchorn364">(fn. 364)</a> In 1201 Thomas of Blakeney
owed a fine for having land of which he had been
disseised, while Basile owed one for having land
in dower. <a href="#fnn365" name="anchorn365">(fn. 365)</a> Thomas of Blakeney died in or before
1232 when his son Thomas had seisin of his lands
and the bailiwick. <a href="#fnn366" name="anchorn366">(fn. 366)</a> The younger Thomas or a
successor of the same name died in 1290 or 1291
holding the manor in chief for the annual rent of
19<em>s</em>. paid to St. Briavels castle. His son and heir
Thomas was a minor and the manor was occupied
until 1295 by William Hathaway, the former
constable of St. Briavels. <a href="#fnn367" name="anchorn367">(fn. 367)</a> In 1330 Thomas of
Blakeney settled his estate on Richard of
Haresfield, Richard's wife Eleanor, and their
heirs, <a href="#fnn368" name="anchorn368">(fn. 368)</a> and Eleanor died holding the estate in
1384 and was succeeded by her grandson John
Haresfield <a href="#fnn369" name="anchorn369">(fn. 369)</a> who died in 1417 or 1418. <a href="#fnn370" name="anchorn370">(fn. 370)</a> Thomas
Haresfield held the manor in 1437. <a href="#fnn371" name="anchorn371">(fn. 371)</a> and Agnes,
daughter of John Haresfield, inherited it later
and married John Barrow. John Barrow, who
before 1495 also inherited land in Blakeney and
elsewhere in Awre parish from his father Walter, <a href="#fnn372" name="anchorn372">(fn. 372)</a> was lord of Blakeney manor in 1508, <a href="#fnn373" name="anchorn373">(fn. 373)</a> and
the manor evidently passed, with Field Court in
Hardwicke, to his son Richard (d. 1563). Richard's son Edmund <a href="#fnn374" name="anchorn374">(fn. 374)</a> died in 1570, holding the
manor, then called Over Hall, and lands including Hayes wood. <a href="#fnn375" name="anchorn375">(fn. 375)</a> Over Hall was presumably
the name of the house later called the Hayes
adjoining the wood, for in the 18th century the
manorial rights of Blakeney were attached to the
Hayes. <a href="#fnn376" name="anchorn376">(fn. 376)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p50"> </a>Edmund Barrow was succeeded in Blakeney
manor by his son James (d. 1606), and James by
his son Edmund, <a href="#fnn377" name="anchorn377">(fn. 377)</a> who was described variously
as of the Hayes <a href="#fnn378" name="anchorn378">(fn. 378)</a> and of Field Court and died in
1641. Edmund's son John succeeded to the
manor <a href="#fnn379" name="anchorn379">(fn. 379)</a> and died in 1682 when he was living at
Nibley, in Blakeney. In John's lifetime, however, the estate became divided, and was
possibly in dispute, between his son George (d.
1696) and Thomas Barrow (d. 1683), a grandson
of James Barrow by a second marriage. Thomas
was listed as woodward of Blakeney bailiwick in
1673 and 1682 but George was so listed in
1677. <a href="#fnn380" name="anchorn380">(fn. 380)</a> George was living at the Hayes in 1672
but in 1681 Thomas, styled of the Hayes, mortgaged Blakeney manor together with the Field
Court estate, reserving the Hayes and lands
which were stated to have lately been held by
George. <a href="#fnn381" name="anchorn381">(fn. 381)</a> George was again styled as of the
Hayes in 1694, and his son Berea Barrow held
the house in 1718. By 1720, however, Thomas
Barrow, son of Thomas, held the Hayes, and
after his death in 1736 the house and whole estate
apparently descended to his daughter Eleanor,
wife of the Revd. Thomas Savage <a href="#fnn382" name="anchorn382">(fn. 382)</a> (d. 1760).
Their son George Savage succeeded and died in
1793, <a href="#fnn383" name="anchorn383">(fn. 383)</a> leaving his sisters as coheirs, and in 1794
Sir Thomas Crawley-Boevey of Flaxley, husband of one of them, <a href="#fnn384" name="anchorn384">(fn. 384)</a> bought out the interest of
the other coheirs in Blakeney manor. <a href="#fnn385" name="anchorn385">(fn. 385)</a> In 1820
Blakeney manor and the Hayes were bought by
William Ambrose (d. 1843), owner of the Hagloe
estate. <a href="#fnn386" name="anchorn386">(fn. 386)</a> The manorial rights apparently belonged to J. Mathias in 1879 and to his trustees
until 1910 or later. <a href="#fnn387" name="anchorn387">(fn. 387)</a> In the earlier 20th century
the Hayes was the farmhouse of a small farm
owned by the Hayman family. <a href="#fnn388" name="anchorn388">(fn. 388)</a> In 1989, when
it had been sold by the owner of the farm, the
house was derelict and awaiting restoration by
its new owners.</p>
			<p><a name="p51"> </a>The Hayes has a north range of one storey,
which has lateral walls of stone rubble but was
formerly timber-framed. The gable end is still
partly timber-framed and may originally have
been internal. At the southern end of the onestoreyed range part of a late-medieval base cruck
is buried within a 17th-century chimney stack.
The stack is associated with a rebuilding of the
early house. That rebuilding was probably in
stone, though the internal partitions and the
upper floor of the two-storeyed eastern porch are
timber-framed. The new block has a cellar, two
storeys, and attics, the upper floors being
reached by a newel stair in a west projection. In
the 19th century a low wing was added to the
west side of the single-storeyed range and the
roof of the 17th-century block was reconstructed. The house stands at the eastern end of
a terraced area which was formerly partly walled
and suggests a formal garden of the late 17th
century or the early 18th.</p>
			<p><a name="p52"> </a>Another estate also called the manor of <em>BLAKENEY</em>, probably including part of the village and
land in the east end of Blakeney tithing, was
recorded in the 14th century. It may have
derived from an unnamed estate, comprising ½
hide and a mill, that Walter Arblaster held in
Bledisloe hundred in 1086, <a href="#fnn389" name="anchorn389">(fn. 389)</a> though an alternative suggestion that Walter's estate lay in the
north of Bledisloe tithing adjoining his Ruddle
manor, in Newnham, is equally possible. <a href="#fnn390" name="anchorn390">(fn. 390)</a> An
estate that John, son of Walter of Blakeney, held
at Blakeney <em>c</em>. 1300 was probably acquired before 1306 by Thomas, Lord Berkeley. <a href="#fnn391" name="anchorn391">(fn. 391)</a> The later
Thomas, Lord Berkeley, had a number of tenants at Blakeney in 1333, and his successors to
Awre manor were receiving the farm of a manor
at Blakeney in 1368 and the farm of its site and
demesne in 1457; <a href="#fnn392" name="anchorn392">(fn. 392)</a> they still had tenants at
Blakeney in the early 17th century. <a href="#fnn393" name="anchorn393">(fn. 393)</a> The ancient
farmhouse of Nether Hall, which was presumably named in distinction to Over Hall (or the
Hayes) and which belonged to Awre manor in
1493, <a href="#fnn394" name="anchorn394">(fn. 394)</a> may have been the site of the second
Blakeney manor. From the mid 17th century,
however, Nether Hall was consistently described
and rated as part of Etloe tithing. <a href="#fnn395" name="anchorn395">(fn. 395)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p53"> </a>A manor called <em>BOX</em>, in the north of the
parish, was recorded from the late 12th century,
and the circumstances under which in 1300 it
was excluded from the perambulation of the
Forest while the rest of Awre was left in suggest
that it had formed a distinct manorial unit from
before 1254. <a href="#fnn396" name="anchorn396">(fn. 396)</a> It is possible, though no other
evidence has been found for the identification,
that it was the successor of an unnamed estate
of 1 hide and ½ yardland in Bledisloe hundred
held by William son of Norman in 1086. <a href="#fnn397" name="anchorn397">(fn. 397)</a> About
1190 Box manor formed part of lands at
Leighterton and at Box cliff that were held from
the heirs of the earls of Hereford for ½ knight's
fee. <a href="#fnn398" name="anchorn398">(fn. 398)</a> William of Lasborough, who died <em>c</em>. 1261,
held a ploughland at Box under the earl of
Hereford for ¼ knight's fee. His heir was his
daughter Agatha, wife of Henry of Dean, <a href="#fnn399" name="anchorn399">(fn. 399)</a> but
in 1285 Box was held by Grimbald Pauncefoot
and John of the Box. <a href="#fnn400" name="anchorn400">(fn. 400)</a> Grimbald, who was
constable of St. Briavels and warden of the
Forest, died in 1287 and his share was held by
his widow Sibyl in 1300, passing to her son
Emery Pauncefoot <a href="#fnn401" name="anchorn401">(fn. 401)</a> before 1309. <a href="#fnn402" name="anchorn402">(fn. 402)</a> By 1346 the
two parts were united in the possession of John
of the Box, <a href="#fnn403" name="anchorn403">(fn. 403)</a> and in 1374 Nicholas Apperley held
the estate. <a href="#fnn404" name="anchorn404">(fn. 404)</a> No later record of Box has been
found until 1577 when Richard Yate conveyed
Box manor to Anthony Wye. <a href="#fnn405" name="anchorn405">(fn. 405)</a> Anthony or a
successor of the same name died in possession
of the site of the manor, Box Farm, and the
demesne lands in 1629, having settled them on
his four daughters. <a href="#fnn406" name="anchorn406">(fn. 406)</a> By 1658 Box farm had
passed to John Gower of Holdfast (Worcs.), <a href="#fnn407" name="anchorn407">(fn. 407)</a> 
who sold it in 1668 to Gloucester corporation.
It remained part of the Sir Thomas Rich trust
estate until the early 1920s. <a href="#fnn408" name="anchorn408">(fn. 408)</a> It was bought then
by F. C. Baber, whose family owned and farmed
it until 1989. <a href="#fnn409" name="anchorn409">(fn. 409)</a> At Box Farm the high ceilings
suggest that the house was reconstructed in the
17th century, but the plan, which included a
lateral main stack and stair turret, and the varied
thickness of the walls indicate that parts of an
earlier building have been incorporated. The
interior was refitted in the early 19th century
and the porch, which incorporates a staircase,
was added late in that century.</p>
			<p><a name="p54"> </a>In the late 1150s Walter of Hereford granted
an estate in Awre to Walter Blund to hold by
the serjeanty of service in the donor's chamber. Later, presumably from <em>c</em>. 1160 when Awre
manor and Walter of Hereford's other possessions passed to the Crown, the holders of the
estate owed service in the royal chamber. <a href="#fnn410" name="anchorn410">(fn. 410)</a> By
1174 Walter Blund had been succeeded by his
son Walter. <a href="#fnn411" name="anchorn411">(fn. 411)</a> The younger Walter or a successor
of the same name held the estate <em>c</em>. 1212. <a href="#fnn412" name="anchorn412">(fn. 412)</a> The
estate later passed to Walter of Awre who died
<em>c</em>. 1278 leaving as his heir an infant son John. <a href="#fnn413" name="anchorn413">(fn. 413)</a> 
whose attainment of full age was verified in
1302. <a href="#fnn414" name="anchorn414">(fn. 414)</a> Robert of Awre later succeeded and died
before 1326 when his son and heir John came of
age. <a href="#fnn415" name="anchorn415">(fn. 415)</a> John died in 1344 when his infant heir was
Thomas of Awre, <a href="#fnn416" name="anchorn416">(fn. 416)</a> who died holding the estate
in 1361. The estate, extended as a messuage, 1
ploughland, 6 a. of meadow, and a mill, passed
to Thomas's brother John <a href="#fnn417" name="anchorn417">(fn. 417)</a> (d. 1382), who left
two daughters Joan and Margaret as his heirs. <a href="#fnn418" name="anchorn418">(fn. 418)</a> 
The two married respectively David ap Thomas
(also called ap Ivor) and Richard of Awre, who
held the estate jointly in 1402. <a href="#fnn419" name="anchorn419">(fn. 419)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p55"> </a>The reference to a mill among the Awre
family's possessions suggests that their estate
was later represented by <em>HALL FARM</em>, west
of Awre village, to which the nearby Hall Mill
belonged until 1731. <a href="#fnn420" name="anchorn420">(fn. 420)</a> In 1570 and 1606 Hall
farm belonged to the Barrows of Blakeney who
were thought to hold it by fealty from Lord
Stafford (an heir of the Hereford family) as of
his manor of Newnham. <a href="#fnn421" name="anchorn421">(fn. 421)</a> In 1677 Hall Farm,
then known as the Hall or North Hall, and 192
a. belonged to Thomas Blackall of Hackney
(Mdx.), who settled the estate on the marriage
of his son Thomas. The younger Thomas was
presumably the Mr. Blackall of London who
owned the estate <em>c</em>. 1700. <a href="#fnn422" name="anchorn422">(fn. 422)</a> In 1731 it belonged
to Thomas Blackall of Great Haseley (Oxon.). <a href="#fnn423" name="anchorn423">(fn. 423)</a> 
In 1749 it apparently belonged to John Purnell
of Dursley, passing <em>c</em>. 1755 to Samuel Blackwell.
Blackwell sold it, probably in 1766, <a href="#fnn424" name="anchorn424">(fn. 424)</a> to James
Thomas of Oatfield Farm, who late in 1766 sold
Hall Farm with 140 a. of land to Gloucester
corporation. <a href="#fnn425" name="anchorn425">(fn. 425)</a> It formed part of the Sir Thomas
Rich trust estate until <em>c</em>. 1921. It was bought
then by F. Baber, <a href="#fnn426" name="anchorn426">(fn. 426)</a> whose family owned and
farmed it in 1989. The rear wing of the house
has been ascribed to the 17th century <a href="#fnn427" name="anchorn427">(fn. 427)</a> but by
1989 recent extensive restoration had obscured
any evidence for that. The front range was added
or rebuilt in the early 19th century.</p>
			<p><a name="p56"> </a>Land called the <em>HAYWARD</em>, lying at Awre
Point east of Awre village, was reclaimed from
the river by Robert son of Hugh, owner of Awre
manor. He gave it <em>c</em>. 1150 to Monmouth priory <a href="#fnn428" name="anchorn428">(fn. 428)</a> 
but either the grant was never implemented or
the land returned later to the manor. In 1204
the Crown granted the Hayward, described as a
yardland, with another yardland, a meadow
called Honey moor (Hundemore), and 6 a. of
land to Walter of Awre the elder, <a href="#fnn429" name="anchorn429">(fn. 429)</a> who became
farmer of the manor that year. Walter died <em>c</em>.
1221 when custody of his land and heir was
granted to Robert de Vernay and Eleanor his
wife. <a href="#fnn430" name="anchorn430">(fn. 430)</a> The estate, including a messuage, was
held by Philip Baderon at his death <em>c</em>. 1278 and
descended in direct line to Philip <a href="#fnn431" name="anchorn431">(fn. 431)</a> (d. <em>c</em>. 1303),
John <a href="#fnn432" name="anchorn432">(fn. 432)</a> (d. <em>c</em>. 1332), and Philip <a href="#fnn433" name="anchorn433">(fn. 433)</a> (d. 1349). The
last Philip was succeeded by his brother Robert
Baderon <a href="#fnn434" name="anchorn434">(fn. 434)</a> (d. 1361), who left as his heirs two
infant daughters Maud and Joan; <a href="#fnn435" name="anchorn435">(fn. 435)</a> Robert's
widow Joan held a third of the estate in dower
until her death in 1396. The younger Joan died
in 1397 when her share passed to Maud and her
husband John Field. <a href="#fnn436" name="anchorn436">(fn. 436)</a> The Barrows, lords of
Blakeney manor, owned the estate in 1570 and
1606. <a href="#fnn437" name="anchorn437">(fn. 437)</a> The house and some of the land were
later detached from the Hayward and Honey
moor, which together comprising 50 a. belonged
in 1660 to Richard Cox the younger. That small
estate, on which a farmhouse was built <em>c</em>. 1680,
was owned by the White family between 1769 <a href="#fnn438" name="anchorn438">(fn. 438)</a> 
and 1849, later passing to the Gloucester municipal charity trustees. <a href="#fnn439" name="anchorn439">(fn. 439)</a> The house at Hayward
had been demolished by 1989 when a derelict
barn remained at its site.</p>
			<p><a name="p57"> </a>An estate called <em>FIELD HOUSE</em> was held by
Richard Trippett (d. 1561), who devised part of
the land to his wife Marian, the remainder of the
estate evidently passing to his son Thomas. <a href="#fnn440" name="anchorn440">(fn. 440)</a> 
Thomas Trippett of Field House died in 1585,
and his eldest son Richard was probably the
Richard Trippett of Field House who died in
1627. <a href="#fnn441" name="anchorn441">(fn. 441)</a> In 1643 the estate belonged to another
Richard Trippett and it passed to his son Richard (d. 1711) and to the younger Richard's son
John (d. 1736). <a href="#fnn442" name="anchorn442">(fn. 442)</a> John Trippett's heirs were his
five daughters, who in 1742 made a partition of
the family's estates in Awre and elsewhere in the
county: Field House and much of its land were
awarded to Elizabeth, wife of William Prestbury,
while the farmhouse called Poulton, in Hagloe
tithing near the centre of the parish, were
awarded with other lands to Perry, wife of the
Revd. Whetham Hill of Newnham. William and
Elizabeth's Field House estate passed to their
son Robert (d. by 1779), whose heirs were his
three sisters. The third share of one of them,
Perry Allen (later Terrett), passed to her son
Thomas Allen, and his son William Allen sold
it in 1821 to Robert Prestbury Hooper, son of
Elizabeth Hooper, one of the other sisters. In
1831 R. P. Hooper partitioned the estate with
Charles Cadogan, son of Robert Prestbury's
third sister Joanna Cadogan: Hooper received
the house and 92 a. of land for his two thirds
and Cadogan received 44 a. for his third. Hooper
(d. 1835) was succeeded by his son, also called
Robert Prestbury Hooper, who added a small
farm at Northington to his estate in 1837. R. P.
Hooper died in 1877, and in 1879 his trustees
sold the Field House estate to the Gloucester
municipal charity trustees. <a href="#fnn443" name="anchorn443">(fn. 443)</a> The oldest part of
Field House is a long range on the east side
which incorporates two cruck trusses and may
date from the 16th century. It is linked by a
much restored stone range, dated 1859 but of
earlier origin, to a gabled, three-storeyed block;
the latter, which has walls of exposed closestudded timber framing, may have been the
parlour end of the house. There are 19th-century
extensions to the north.</p>
			<p><a name="p58"> </a>A large estate, usually known as the <em>HAGLOE</em>
estate, originated in lands acquired by the Birkin
family, which was recorded in Hagloe from the
mid 16th century. <a href="#fnn444" name="anchorn444">(fn. 444)</a> John Birkin (d. 1691) of
Hagloe was succeeded by his son Richard (d.
1732) and Richard by his son John. John Birkin
(d. 1740) <a href="#fnn445" name="anchorn445">(fn. 445)</a> devised his lands among his three
daughters: Elizabeth's share included Bledisloe
manor, bought by the elder John Birkin, Susannah's included lands in Etloe, Hagloe, and
Blakeney, and Mary's included Oatfield farm,
which her father had inherited from his grandfather Richard Hooper (d. <em>c</em>. 1717). Elizabeth,
who on the death of her mother Margaret Birkin
in 1749 also received her father's dwelling house,
evidently Hagloe House, <a href="#fnn446" name="anchorn446">(fn. 446)</a> married Robert Boy
and died in 1751. After her death Robert retained her land <a href="#fnn447" name="anchorn447">(fn. 447)</a> and lived at Hagloe House until
his death in 1800 when he devised his estate to
his wife's nephew John Birkin Thomas. <a href="#fnn448" name="anchorn448">(fn. 448)</a> Mary
died unmarried in 1753 leaving her land to
Susannah, <a href="#fnn449" name="anchorn449">(fn. 449)</a> who later married James Thomas.
Thomas, who took up residence at Oatfield
Farm and traded as a merchant from Gatcombe,
added Poulton Court to his estate in 1766. At
his death in 1780 he was succeeded by his son
John Birkin Thomas, who inherited Robert
Boy's estate in 1800. <a href="#fnn450" name="anchorn450">(fn. 450)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p59"> </a>J. B. Thomas died in 1808, leaving to his wife
Elizabeth <a href="#fnn451" name="anchorn451">(fn. 451)</a> his extensive estate, which comprised a block of farms lying between Gatcombe
and Brimspill, including Hagloe House, Poulton
Court, Oatfield, the Ledge, Merryway, and a
farmhouse at Little Hagloe, together with the
manorial rights of Bledisloe and Poulton and
fishing rights in the Severn. In 1810 Elizabeth
Thomas married William Ambrose, <a href="#fnn452" name="anchorn452">(fn. 452)</a> who also
acquired lands in the north of the parish and,
with a total of 763 a., was the largest landowner
in Awre parish in 1839. <a href="#fnn453" name="anchorn453">(fn. 453)</a> Elizabeth died in
1838 <a href="#fnn454" name="anchorn454">(fn. 454)</a> and William Ambrose, who traded as a
timber merchant until declared bankrupt in
1839, <a href="#fnn455" name="anchorn455">(fn. 455)</a> died in 1843, leaving the estate at Hagloe
heavily mortgaged. One of the mortgagees,
Nathaniel Morgan, eventually gained possession
and in 1853 sold the Hagloe estate, comprising
<em>c</em>. 525 a., to the Crown Commissioners of
Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues, <a href="#fnn456" name="anchorn456">(fn. 456)</a> whose
purchase was made partly to facilitate schemes
for railway building. <a href="#fnn457" name="anchorn457">(fn. 457)</a> The Crown added two
farms adjoining the estate on the north, Poulton
farm in 1860 and Little Box farm in 1866, and
in 1900 added a second farm at Little Hagloe. <a href="#fnn458" name="anchorn458">(fn. 458)</a> 
The Crown remained owner of 702 a. in 1989.
By that time most of the farmhouses had been
abandoned or sold as private residences and the
bulk of the land was farmed from Hagloe House,
the chief house of the estate, with a smaller farm
based on Poulton Court. <a href="#fnn459" name="anchorn459">(fn. 459)</a> Hagloe House was
evidently the dwelling house of John Birkin
described as new-built in 1737. <a href="#fnn460" name="anchorn460">(fn. 460)</a> It was probably
built about ten years before that date and has a
six-bayed front of red brick with stone dressings.
Inside there survives a contemporary staircase
of high quality.</p>
			<p><a name="p60"> </a>An estate based on <em>ETLOE HOUSE</em> was built
up by the A Deane family, which was recorded
at Etloe from the early 16th century. <a href="#fnn461" name="anchorn461">(fn. 461)</a> Customary lands of Awre and Etloe manor were held
after the death of Matthew A Deane in 1658 <a href="#fnn462" name="anchorn462">(fn. 462)</a> 
by his widow Margaret (d. <em>c</em>. 1700), passing
according to the custom of that manor to his
youngest son Robert (d. 1727). <a href="#fnn463" name="anchorn463">(fn. 463)</a> Robert was
succeeded by his son Matthew <a href="#fnn464" name="anchorn464">(fn. 464)</a> who bought a
farm at Little Hagloe from the Driver family in
1766 <a href="#fnn465" name="anchorn465">(fn. 465)</a> and was said to have a large estate in Etloe
tithing <a href="#fnn466" name="anchorn466">(fn. 466)</a> before his death in 1791. Matthew was
succeeded by his son Matthew A Deane of
Alderley <a href="#fnn467" name="anchorn467">(fn. 467)</a> (d. <em>c</em>. 1818) and the younger Matthew
by his daughter Margaret. <a href="#fnn468" name="anchorn468">(fn. 468)</a> Margaret A Deane
(d. 1823) devised her estate to her cousin John
Blanch of Bristol, <a href="#fnn469" name="anchorn469">(fn. 469)</a> whose family had been customary tenants at Etloe for many years. <a href="#fnn470" name="anchorn470">(fn. 470)</a> John
Blanch (d. 1833) devised the estate to his nephew
Richard Rosser, <a href="#fnn471" name="anchorn471">(fn. 471)</a> and in 1839 Rosser owned 359
a. with Etloe House and farmhouses at Little
Hagloe and Upper Etloe; the customary land,
which included the site of Etloe House, was then
a fairly small part of the total acreage. <a href="#fnn472" name="anchorn472">(fn. 472)</a> Rosser
(d. 1840) left the estate to his wife Sarah (d.
1847) and then to his son Charles, who died in
1876 having settled it on his four children as
tenants in common. The Rossers sold the farm
at Little Hagloe to the Crown in 1900 <a href="#fnn473" name="anchorn473">(fn. 473)</a> and
apparently disposed of the rest of their estate
then. <a href="#fnn474" name="anchorn474">(fn. 474)</a> About 1915 Etloe House and 135 a.
belonged to the executors of J. Wheatley. <a href="#fnn475" name="anchorn475">(fn. 475)</a> In
1989 that part of the former estate was owned
and farmed by a branch of the Baber family.
Etloe House, a tall and narrow farmhouse, was
built in 1730 at the time of the marriage of
Matthew A Deane and his wife Anne. <a href="#fnn476" name="anchorn476">(fn. 476)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p61"> </a>A house called <em>COX</em>, later <em>OAKLANDS
FARM</em>, at the north end of the parish <a href="#fnn477" name="anchorn477">(fn. 477)</a> was the
centre of a customary estate of Awre manor in
1573. <a href="#fnn478" name="anchorn478">(fn. 478)</a> It was alienated from the manor in 1656
and was probably bought by the tenant Matthew
White. <a href="#fnn479" name="anchorn479">(fn. 479)</a> Later, possibly by 1690, <a href="#fnn480" name="anchorn480">(fn. 480)</a> it passed to
Eustace Hardwicke; he was living at the house,
then called Hardwicke House, in 1710 and was
said to have a good estate in Awre and other
parishes. <a href="#fnn481" name="anchorn481">(fn. 481)</a> At his death in 1718 he devised the
estate to his daughter Patience <a href="#fnn482" name="anchorn482">(fn. 482)</a> and in 1720 it
was settled on her marriage to Robert Walter of
Bristol. <a href="#fnn483" name="anchorn483">(fn. 483)</a> By 1741 Cox belonged in right of his
wife to John Hardwicke, <a href="#fnn484" name="anchorn484">(fn. 484)</a> possibly a second
husband of Patience, who died <em>c</em>. 1762. <a href="#fnn485" name="anchorn485">(fn. 485)</a> John
Hardwicke was living at Cox in 1763. <a href="#fnn486" name="anchorn486">(fn. 486)</a> It was
owned by John Walter in 1770 <a href="#fnn487" name="anchorn487">(fn. 487)</a> and later by
William Marshal (d. by 1794). <a href="#fnn488" name="anchorn488">(fn. 488)</a> Cox was sold
before 1799 to Thomas Ambrose, from whom
the house was leased as a farmhouse at the
beginning of the 19th century. <a href="#fnn489" name="anchorn489">(fn. 489)</a> In 1839 the
house, leased with 73 a., was part of William
Ambrose's estates, <a href="#fnn490" name="anchorn490">(fn. 490)</a> and <em>c</em>. 1850 Oaklands farm
was bought by Henry Crawshay and added to
his Oaklands Park estate. <a href="#fnn491" name="anchorn491">(fn. 491)</a> The farmhouse was
rebuilt in the early or mid 19th century.</p>
			<p><a name="p62"> </a>
				<em>OAKLANDS PARK</em>, a mansion set in
parkland, was built just north-east of Oaklands
Farm in the early 19th century. Sir James Jelf.
formerly a Gloucester banker and a partner in
the nearby Bullo Pill tramroad, <a href="#fnn492" name="anchorn492">(fn. 492)</a> apparently
built it; he was living there in 1818 <a href="#fnn493" name="anchorn493">(fn. 493)</a> and in the
1820s, when he ran a marble works at Bullo
Pill. <a href="#fnn494" name="anchorn494">(fn. 494)</a> In 1830 Oaklands was offered for sale
together with 26 a. of wood and a farm of 100
a. <a href="#fnn495" name="anchorn495">(fn. 495)</a> but Jelf still owned the house and its park in
1839. <a href="#fnn496" name="anchorn496">(fn. 496)</a> About 1850 the house, park, and adjoining land, including Oaklands farm, were bought
by the ironmaster Henry Crawshay, <a href="#fnn497" name="anchorn497">(fn. 497)</a> who was
living at Oaklands Park by 1856. <a href="#fnn498" name="anchorn498">(fn. 498)</a> He died in
1879 and his widow Liza Eliza owned Oaklands
Park until her death in 1895. <a href="#fnn499" name="anchorn499">(fn. 499)</a> In 1899 it was
sold to William Gwynne-Evans of Fordham
(Essex), <a href="#fnn500" name="anchorn500">(fn. 500)</a> whose family owned it until 1976. The
house and park were bought then by the Camphill Village Trust, a charity for the care of
mentally retarded adults; in 1989 the occupants
were employed in craft work and in the large
kitchen garden attached to the house. <a href="#fnn501" name="anchorn501">(fn. 501)</a> The
original house, built by 1818, survives as a low
wing at the north end of the present house; it
was refitted <em>c</em>. 1830. <a href="#fnn502" name="anchorn502">(fn. 502)</a> Some adjacent outbuildings and the lodge on the main road at the parish
boundary are contemporary with it. About 1850
Henry Crawshay built a large new house in
Renaissance style. It has a main block of two tall
storeys with principal fronts to the north-east
and south-east and a service block, of the same
height but incorporating three storeys, to the
west. There were terraced gardens to the south
and south-west and a winter garden, unroofed
by 1989, <a href="#fnn503" name="anchorn503">(fn. 503)</a> and stable block on the west.</p>
			<p><a name="p63"> </a>In the late 18th century a large estate was built
up by John Wade, whose family had been
prominent leaseholders under Gloucester corporation since 1710. <a href="#fnn504" name="anchorn504">(fn. 504)</a> Wade's estate included land
in Bledisloe tithing where, before 1794, he built
a residence called <em>NEW HOUSE</em> beside the
Gloucester-Chepstow road, <a href="#fnn505" name="anchorn505">(fn. 505)</a> but most of his
land lay in Awre tithing. Between 1767 and 1796
he acquired many of the customary tenements
of Awre and Etloe manor, <a href="#fnn506" name="anchorn506">(fn. 506)</a> as well as freehold
land <a href="#fnn507" name="anchorn507">(fn. 507)</a> based on the farmhouse in Awre village
later called New House Farm. Additional freehold and customary land, formerly belonging to
the Hopkins family, was added to the estate in
1814 and <em>c</em>. 1827. <a href="#fnn508" name="anchorn508">(fn. 508)</a> John Wade (d. 1819) <a href="#fnn509" name="anchorn509">(fn. 509)</a> was
succeeded in his freehold by his grandson John
Wade Wait, who also received the customary
land by surrender of his younger brother William. <a href="#fnn510" name="anchorn510">(fn. 510)</a> In 1839 J. W. Wait owned a total of 527
a. in the parish, <a href="#fnn511" name="anchorn511">(fn. 511)</a> and in 1849 he added the small
Hayward estate. He died in 1865 and was succeeded by his son John Wade Wait (d. 1868). In
1870 the younger J. W. Wait's trustees sold New
House Farm and most of the freehold adjoining
the village to the Gloucester municipal charity
trustees, as trustees of the city's almshouses, and
most of the customary land to the same body, as
lords of the manor and trustees of Sir Thomas
Rich's school. <a href="#fnn512" name="anchorn512">(fn. 512)</a> The Wait family remained owners of New House and lands in the north of the
parish until 1919 or later. <a href="#fnn513" name="anchorn513">(fn. 513)</a> New House, a threestoreyed late 18th-century residence, <a href="#fnn514" name="anchorn514">(fn. 514)</a> was much
reduced in size in the early 20th century when
the two upper storeys were removed and replaced by gables. The house was called Severn
Lodge in 1989, when its owner had a business
there selling garden equipment and a woodworking firm occupied an adjoining part of the
grounds.</p>
			<p><a name="p64"> </a>The Gloucester municipal charity trustees,
acting in their capacity as trustees of St.
Bartholomew's hospital and the other almshouses of that city, acquired an estate adjoining
Awre village by a series of purchases from 1854. <a href="#fnn515" name="anchorn515">(fn. 515)</a> 
The principal acquisitions were made in 1870,
when they bought 54 a. from themselves as
trustees of Sir Thomas Rich's school and New
House Farm, Hayward, and 106 a. from the
Wait family, <a href="#fnn516" name="anchorn516">(fn. 516)</a> and in 1879, when they bought
Field House with 104 a. <a href="#fnn517" name="anchorn517">(fn. 517)</a> New House Farm and
some land were sold before 1989 when the
Gloucester Almshouse and Pension Charities retained Field House and 160 a. <a href="#fnn518" name="anchorn518">(fn. 518)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p65"> </a>A small farm based on a house in Hagloe called
Old Box was bought in 1681 by the trustees of
a Newland charity. <a href="#fnn519" name="anchorn519">(fn. 519)</a> In 1839 the land, which
comprised 41 a., was farmed with the adjoining
Little Box farm and the house may by then have
been demolished. <a href="#fnn520" name="anchorn520">(fn. 520)</a> There was a small barn at
the site in 1989 when the charity still owned the
land.</p>
			<p><a name="p66"> </a>Gloucester abbey acquired a meadow in Awre
by gift of Adam of Bledisloe in the early 13th
century, and in 1336 had a grant of a right of
way to it. Known as Monk's mead, <a href="#fnn521" name="anchorn521">(fn. 521)</a> the meadow
lay near the centre of the parish, south of Hall
grove. <a href="#fnn522" name="anchorn522">(fn. 522)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p67"> </a>The rectory of Awre, belonging to Llanthony
priory, Gloucester, from 1351, <a href="#fnn523" name="anchorn523">(fn. 523)</a> was leased under the Crown in the late 16th century. It
comprised the corn and hay tithes, two tithe
barns, one in Awre and one in Poulton, and a
few acres of glebe land. <a href="#fnn524" name="anchorn524">(fn. 524)</a> In 1607 the Crown sold
it to to Thomas James. <a href="#fnn525" name="anchorn525">(fn. 525)</a> It descended with the
James family's Soilwell estate, in Lydney, <a href="#fnn526" name="anchorn526">(fn. 526)</a> until
1657 when it was bought by the Haberdashers'
Company and used to endow the livings of Awre
and Blakeney. <a href="#fnn527" name="anchorn527">(fn. 527)</a>

			<p><a name="p68"> </a>In
1086 Awre manor had 1 ploughteam in demesne
and a single <em>servus</em>, <a href="#fnn528" name="anchorn528">(fn. 528)</a> and its demesne remained
small in later centuries. The demesne belonging
to the earl of Pembroke's part of the manor
included 22 a. of arable and 4½ a. of meadow
with some pasture in 1296; <a href="#fnn529" name="anchorn529">(fn. 529)</a> the Mortimers' part
of the manor was described in 1301 as 16½ a. of
arable, 5 a. of meadow, and 1½ a. of pasture,
with two other pastures, <a href="#fnn530" name="anchorn530">(fn. 530)</a> while another survey
in 1304 extended it at 21½ a. of arable, 4 a. of
meadow, and 2 a. of pasture. <a href="#fnn531" name="anchorn531">(fn. 531)</a> In 1329 and in
the 1360s the demesne of the reunited manor
was an arable enterprise. There were 60 a. of
arable, <em>c</em>. 40 a. of which were sown each year
with wheat, beans, and oats. Two ploughmen,
working one team, were retained at an allowance
of grain and the harvest was gathered by temporary wage-labour; the works owed by the
tenants, apparently comprising only bedrips,
were realized as cash. There was no permanent
stock other than the plough oxen; any animals
received as heriots were transferred to other
manors of the Berkeley family across the river.
An orchard provided fruit in 1329. <a href="#fnn532" name="anchorn532">(fn. 532)</a> By 1457 the
demesne land of the manor was leased, <a href="#fnn533" name="anchorn533">(fn. 533)</a> and in
the 17th and 18th centuries, when it probably
included former customary land, it was leased
with the manor house called Lypiatt or with the
farmhouse called Whitescourt. <a href="#fnn534" name="anchorn534">(fn. 534)</a> In 1731 the two
farms together comprised 158 a. of land, including a considerable acreage in the open fields. <a href="#fnn535" name="anchorn535">(fn. 535)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p69"> </a>The tenants on Awre manor in 1086 were 12
<em>villani</em> and 8 bordars, working 14 ploughteams
between them. <a href="#fnn536" name="anchorn536">(fn. 536)</a> Later there was a large tenantry, which was further increased by the addition
of land in Etloe in the 14th century. In 1301
there were 26 free tenants and 23 customary
tenants on the Mortimers' part of the manor. <a href="#fnn537" name="anchorn537">(fn. 537)</a> 
The total number of holdings may have been
reduced in the later Middle Ages: several were
in the lord's hands in 1457 <a href="#fnn538" name="anchorn538">(fn. 538)</a> and in 1493 some
holdings included more than one house. In 1493
there were <em>c</em>. 25 tenants who held houses or tofts
with holdings that ranged in size from a single
close to 30 a., besides others who held only
parcels of land. The acreages of the holdings
were usually multiples of 6, the ancient customary yardland having probably been 24 a. By the
late 15th century many of the tenements on the
manor were held by 'base tenure', <a href="#fnn539" name="anchorn539">(fn. 539)</a> a favourable
form of copyhold by inheritance, and there were
others held by the more usual form of copyhold
for lives. <a href="#fnn540" name="anchorn540">(fn. 540)</a> In 1573 the tenants by base tenure
asserted that their tenements passed by Borough
English to the youngest son, the youngest
daughter, or other next of kin, that they had
unrestricted right of alienation, that on succession or purchase the heriot or fine was fixed at
the equivalent of a year's rent, and that widows
had freebench and guardianship of an heir who
was a minor. <a href="#fnn541" name="anchorn541">(fn. 541)</a> In 1599 the tenants by base tenure
were in dispute over the customs with their new
lord Sir Edward Winter and some consulted a
lawyer. <a href="#fnn542" name="anchorn542">(fn. 542)</a> The dispute was settled by arbitration
in 1612: among other matters it was established
that tenants could grant leases for up to 12 years
without the lord's consent and dispose freely of
the timber on their estates. <a href="#fnn543" name="anchorn543">(fn. 543)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p70"> </a>Later the identities of the customary tenements of Awre and Etloe manor were gradually
obscured. They were amalgamated one with
another or with lands held by other forms of
tenure and most of the houses were abandoned.
In 1741 a survey of the manor named 34 ancient
customary tenements, held by a total of 22
tenants, in Awre, Etloe, and Bledisloe; 21 (all
but one of them in Awre tithing) were base
tenures and 13 were copyholds for lives, and
each owed a heriot though few by then had
houses. There were also various parcels of land
held by base tenure but not liable to heriots,
evidently lands severed from the ancient tenements. <a href="#fnn544" name="anchorn544">(fn. 544)</a> The original pattern was further
obscured by later amalgamations and, in Awre
tithing, by inclosure in 1796. In the late 18th
century a large part of the customary land was
included by John Wade in his New House
estate, <a href="#fnn545" name="anchorn545">(fn. 545)</a> which in 1825 had 118 a. in Awre tithing
and 10 a. in Bledisloe tithing and owed heriots
in respect of 13 houses, of which no more than
four still existed. The other main customary
holdings in Awre tithing were then Cades (later
Northington farm) with 38 a., which was joined
soon afterwards to the New House estate,
Brunches with 34 a., and the Awre family's
Upper House farm with 32 a. In Etloe tithing
many of the holdings passed to the Etloe House
estate, which included 59 a. of customary land
with the sites of 8 ancient houses in 1825. The
other main customary holding in Etloe was then
44 a. based on Nibley Farm. <a href="#fnn546" name="anchorn546">(fn. 546)</a> The bulk of the
customary land of the New House estate was
bought by the lords of the manor in 1870, <a href="#fnn547" name="anchorn547">(fn. 547)</a> and
most of the other base tenures and copyholds
were enfranchised between 1874 and 1886, <a href="#fnn548" name="anchorn548">(fn. 548)</a> the
process of enfranchisement being completed in
the early 1920s. <a href="#fnn549" name="anchorn549">(fn. 549)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p71"> </a>By the early 17th century Awre and Etloe
manor also included leaseholds for years or lives,
including the demesne farms and the New
Warth. <a href="#fnn550" name="anchorn550">(fn. 550)</a> Fourteen of the smaller leaseholds were
sold, in most cases to the existing tenants, by Sir
John Winter in 1656, <a href="#fnn551" name="anchorn551">(fn. 551)</a> swelling the already
considerable number of freeholds on the manor.
In 1741 there was a number of small leaseholds,
usually for 99 years or lives, including some
houses built fairly recently on waste land. <a href="#fnn552" name="anchorn552">(fn. 552)</a> In
the early 1740s the larger farms of the manor
estate, comprising the demesne farms of Lypiatt
and Whitescourt and Box farm, were held on
leases for 15 or 21 years; by the end of the
century those farms and Maiden Hall and Hall
farms, which had been added to the estate, <a href="#fnn553" name="anchorn553">(fn. 553)</a> 
were rack rented. <a href="#fnn554" name="anchorn554">(fn. 554)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p72"> </a>In 1086 the former members of Awre manor
- Etloe, Bledisloe, and Purton - had 1 team
and 2 <em>servi</em> in demesne and the tenants were 20
<em>villani</em> and 3 bordars with 13 teams. <a href="#fnn555" name="anchorn555">(fn. 555)</a> Poulton
manor had 40 a. of arable and 5 a. of meadow
in demesne in 1329. <a href="#fnn556" name="anchorn556">(fn. 556)</a> In 1547 the demesne land
of Poulton, held with the manor house on a long
lease, covered 230 a., and there were five copyhold tenements on the manor; <a href="#fnn557" name="anchorn557">(fn. 557)</a> three or more of
the copyholds were enfranchised on 1,000-year
leases in 1568. <a href="#fnn558" name="anchorn558">(fn. 558)</a> Blakeney manor had six tenants
in 1292. <a href="#fnn559" name="anchorn559">(fn. 559)</a> Bledisloe manor in 1620 included
demesne lands, eight tenants holding on leases
for years or lives, and a number of freeholders; <a href="#fnn560" name="anchorn560">(fn. 560)</a> 
the leaseholds were all sold before 1671. <a href="#fnn561" name="anchorn561">(fn. 561)</a> The
lord of Etloe Duchy enfranchised two customary
tenements on his manor in 1669. <a href="#fnn562" name="anchorn562">(fn. 562)</a> That manor
still included a few copyhold dwellings at Gatcombe in the 1820s. <a href="#fnn563" name="anchorn563">(fn. 563)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p73"> </a>Only Awre tithing had a fully-developed system of open-field agriculture. The remainder of
the parish consisted almost entirely of ancient
closes, which in Blakeney and the western part
of Bledisloe were probably still being won from
the waste of the Forest of Dean in the early
Middle Ages. In 1220 Awre was assessed on 11
ploughteams, Poulton on 3½, Etloe (presumably
including the Duchy manor) and Box on 2 each,
and Bledisloe on 1, and no assessment was given
for Blakeney. <a href="#fnn564" name="anchorn564">(fn. 564)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p74"> </a>In Awre tithing in the early modern period
there were six main open fields and a few smaller
ones. A compact block of open-field land, occupying the level east of the village, comprised Cut
(or Runch) Marsh on the north, Great Marsh in
the centre, and Woodend Marsh adjoining the
Severn on the south. On slightly higher ground
north of the village were Lynch field and
Northington field, respectively east and west of
Northington Lane, and Hamstalls field, between
Northington and the river. A small field called
Acorn field lay west of Woodend Lane, another
field called Brick Furlong lay north of the
church, <a href="#fnn565" name="anchorn565">(fn. 565)</a> and another called Woodley Hill lay
some way west of the village, on the north side
of the Newnham road. <a href="#fnn566" name="anchorn566">(fn. 566)</a> The three-course rotation which was evidently followed in the Awre
fields in the 14th century <a href="#fnn567" name="anchorn567">(fn. 567)</a> continued during
later centuries. In the early 18th century the
courses were wheat and rye, beans and peas, and
a fallow. <a href="#fnn568" name="anchorn568">(fn. 568)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p75"> </a>The common meadows of the tithing were Rod
meadow, adjoining the river west of Hamstalls,
Dole (or Dow) meadow, a lot meadow lying east
of Lynch field, and Honey Moor, adjoining the
river east of Woodend Lane. <a href="#fnn569" name="anchorn569">(fn. 569)</a> There was common pasture for sheep in the open fields, where
the stint in 1728 was 1 to each acre of land
owned, and for cattle in the Old Warth, the strip
of reclaimed land extending across Awre Point
beyond the open fields. The rights in the Old
Warth were enjoyed by all inhabitants of the
tithing, including landless cottagers. They were
regulated periodically, and rates were levied to
meet the cost of prosecuting those pasturing
illegally, a hayward's wages, and any other expenses. In 1728 the total stint in the warth was
2 bulls (belonging to Lypiatt farm and the Field
House estate), 101 cows, and 23 yearlings and
calves. <a href="#fnn570" name="anchorn570">(fn. 570)</a> The New Warth, recently formed beyond the Old Warth, was appropriated to the
lord of the manor under the agreement between
Sir Edward Winter and his tenants in 1612, and
most of it was ploughed and cropped in 1614
after his lessee had drained it. <a href="#fnn571" name="anchorn571">(fn. 571)</a> Later, usually
leased with one of the demesne farms, it was
pasture land. <a href="#fnn572" name="anchorn572">(fn. 572)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p76"> </a>A few small private inclosures were made in
Awre tithing, mainly in the fields around
Northington. <a href="#fnn573" name="anchorn573">(fn. 573)</a> Parliamentary inclosure of the
tithing, carried out in 1796 and confirmed by an
award the following year, re-allotted <em>c</em>. 300 a. of
open field and common meadow, the 64 a. of the
Old Warth, where the allotments included plots
of ¾ a. for the rights of common attached to each
cottage, and many of the old closes, which on
some of the farms had been considerably intermixed. A total of 24 owners received allotments
in respect of land and rights attached to freehold
and customary estates. John Wade was awarded
65 a. for his freehold and customary holdings
and added another 21 a. by purchase or exchange, the lords of the manor received 3 a. for
right of soil and 37 a. for their rack-rented
farmland, William Ryder, owner of a farm at
Northington, received 55 a., the owners of Field
House received 49 a., and five or six other
owners received <em>c</em>. 20 a. or more. <a href="#fnn574" name="anchorn574">(fn. 574)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p77"> </a>In the remainder of the parish there were only
a few small open fields and common meadows
and those were mostly inclosed at an early date.
In 1547 one of the tenants on Poulton manor
had parcels of arable in Nup field and another
had a close of that name, presumably taken from
the field. Most of the Poulton tenants then had
parcels in a common meadow called Broad
mead <a href="#fnn575" name="anchorn575">(fn. 575)</a> by Bideford brook, east of Little Box
Farm; it was not inclosed until after 1853. <a href="#fnn576" name="anchorn576">(fn. 576)</a> 
Nether Lowfield in Bledisloe, mentioned in
1530, <a href="#fnn577" name="anchorn577">(fn. 577)</a> was apparently a small open field in the
valley of Soudley brook north of Blakeney. In
the same area probably lay the meadow in which
Bledisloe tenants owned parcels in 1620. <a href="#fnn578" name="anchorn578">(fn. 578)</a> In
Etloe <em>c</em>. 1300 a man owned scattered parcels of
arable in a field called Brockholebeeches, near
the river south-east of the Purton road, <a href="#fnn579" name="anchorn579">(fn. 579)</a> but the
only later evidence of communal agriculture
found was the right of tenants of Awre and Etloe
manor in the tithing to pasture animals on
Nibley green. <a href="#fnn580" name="anchorn580">(fn. 580)</a> From the 1430s or earlier the
various tithings all had rights of common in the
royal demesne land of the Forest of Dean in
return for annual payments called herbage
money, <a href="#fnn581" name="anchorn581">(fn. 581)</a> but by the mid 19th century only a few
parishioners still exercised the rights. <a href="#fnn582" name="anchorn582">(fn. 582)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p78"> </a>In 1596 Thomas Bridgeman, owner of Poulton
Court, was reported to have converted 200 a. of
arable to pasture, <a href="#fnn583" name="anchorn583">(fn. 583)</a> and the parish presumably
shared in the general trend towards pastoral
farming evident in the Severnside area in the
post-medieval period. There remained, however, a good proportion of arable land, even on
the inclosed farms outside Awre tithing. In 1731
Box farm had 74 a. of arable in a total acreage
of 170, <a href="#fnn584" name="anchorn584">(fn. 584)</a> and in 1792 Poulton Court farm had
61 a. in 212 a. and Oatfield farm had 68 a. in
219 a. <a href="#fnn585" name="anchorn585">(fn. 585)</a> In 1801, when the parish was said to
contain a total of just under 3,000 a. (a considerable underestimate), 727 a. were returned as
under crops. All but a few acres were growing
cereals and pulse; there had apparently been
little or no attempt to introduce roots into the
rotation. <a href="#fnn586" name="anchorn586">(fn. 586)</a> Orchards, mostly for cider apples,
were widespread. Cider, cider apples, and apples
and pears for eating were included in tithing
customs in 1699, <a href="#fnn587" name="anchorn587">(fn. 587)</a> and all the main farms had
cider mills and presses in the 18th century. <a href="#fnn588" name="anchorn588">(fn. 588)</a> The
Hagloe crab, a cider apple regarded in the late
18th century as second only to the stire in
quality, was developed in Hagloe by a Mr.
Bellamy <em>c</em>. 1710. <a href="#fnn589" name="anchorn589">(fn. 589)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p79"> </a>During the 19th century and the early 20th the
number of farms in the large parish was <em>c</em>. 35-40,
and, with the smallholders and fruit growers,
there was a total of 67 agricultural occupiers in
1896 and 1926. <a href="#fnn590" name="anchorn590">(fn. 590)</a> In 1851 the largest farms were
situated in the east and north of the parish,
where the Waits' New House farm had 330 a.
and Hall farm, then including most of the land
once held with the old manorial demesne farms,
had 300 a. The two farms each employed 10
labourers, while Box farm (260 a.), including the
land of Maiden Hall and Hamstalls farms, employed 9. The other large farms were Hickman's
Court (196 a.) in Bledisloe, Bledisloe farm (161
a.), and Poulton Court (180 a.). In Hagloe and
Etloe tithings in the south of the parish there
was a regular pattern of farms, mostly <em>c</em>. 100 a.
and employing 2-4 labourers, while the west of
the parish had mainly small farms. <a href="#fnn591" name="anchorn591">(fn. 591)</a> In 1926 37
farms of over 20 a. were returned, 5 of them
having more than 150 a. <a href="#fnn592" name="anchorn592">(fn. 592)</a> There had been a
considerable reduction in the number of farms
by the 1980s, most of the smaller ones having
been amalgamated with larger units and their
farmhouses sold off or abandoned. In 1988 there
were 23 farms of over 10 ha. (25 a.) among a
total of 31 holdings returned for the parish. The
farms were worked by a total of 104 people, but
the smaller ones were worked only on a parttime basis. <a href="#fnn593" name="anchorn593">(fn. 593)</a> The largest farms were Hagloe
House, from which <em>c</em>. 202 ha. (<em>c</em>. 500 a.), the
bulk of the Crown's estate, were farmed, and
Hall farm, which was held with Bledisloe farm.</p>
			<p><a name="p80"> </a>In 1839 Awre parish contained 966 a. of arable
as against 2,870 a. of permanent grassland and
orchard, <a href="#fnn594" name="anchorn594">(fn. 594)</a> and in 1866 1,124 a. of arable were
returned, including 401 a. under wheat, 283 a.
under other cereals or pulse, and 368 a. under
clover, grass leys, roots, or other fodder crops. <a href="#fnn595" name="anchorn595">(fn. 595)</a> 
By the latter date draining had facilitated the
ploughing up of some old pasture in the lower
parts of the parish. A programme of draining
was begun on Box and Hall farms in 1846, <a href="#fnn596" name="anchorn596">(fn. 596)</a> and
in 1851 three men working as drainers lived in
Awre tithing. <a href="#fnn597" name="anchorn597">(fn. 597)</a> Animal husbandry included
sheep raising, dairying, and cattle raising in 1866
when totals of 1,550 sheep, 202 milk cows, and
727 other cattle were returned. <a href="#fnn598" name="anchorn598">(fn. 598)</a> By 1896 the
slump in cereals had reduced the total arable
acreage to 516. The farms turned increasingly
to other enterprises, particularly to dairying. In
1896 375 cows in milk or in calf were returned, <a href="#fnn599" name="anchorn599">(fn. 599)</a> 
and among the farms then concentrating on
dairying were Hall and Field House, both in the
east part of the parish <a href="#fnn600" name="anchorn600">(fn. 600)</a> where much of the
former open-field land of Awre tithing had been
converted to grassland. In 1926 579 cows in milk
or in calf were returned. Other livestock enterprises were then well represented with 472 other
cattle, 2,123 sheep, 390 pigs, and 4,866 chickens
returned. <a href="#fnn601" name="anchorn601">(fn. 601)</a> There was a stud for shire horses at
Box farm in 1906, <a href="#fnn602" name="anchorn602">(fn. 602)</a> and in the early 1920s E. G.
Courtman, later vicar of Blakeney, kept Wessex
saddleback pigs and pedigree poultry at Priory
farm (formerly Hamstalls). <a href="#fnn603" name="anchorn603">(fn. 603)</a> In 1896 341 a. of
orchard were returned in the parish and, though
the acreage had fallen by 1926, <a href="#fnn604" name="anchorn604">(fn. 604)</a> a number of
parishioners specialized in fruit growing and
cider making in the early 20th century. A perry
pear tree, known as the Blakeney Red, was
widely planted, and cider orchards in Bledisloe
were acquired before 1927 by Schweppes Ltd. <a href="#fnn605" name="anchorn605">(fn. 605)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p81"> </a>In the late 1980s dairying remained the principal farming enterprise, with seven specialist
dairy farms among the holdings returned in
1988. Several other farms concentrated mainly
on cattle and sheep raising, and most also grew
wheat and barley. Totals of 2,118 cattle, including 858 cows in milk, 5,329 sheep and lambs,
and 373.5 ha. (923 a.) of cereals were returned.
Most of the orchards had been grubbed up by
1988, leaving only 14 ha. (35 a.), mainly in the
Bledisloe area, where soft fruit was also
grown. <a href="#fnn606" name="anchorn606">(fn. 606)</a>

			<h3 id="h3-0005">Mills and Ironworks.</h3>
			<p><a name="p82"> </a>In the Middle Ages,
when the parish was presumably more thickly
wooded, ironworking was carried on by some of
the small, movable forges then working in the
Forest. A movable forge was allowed to operate
at Etloe in 1228 <a href="#fnn607" name="anchorn607">(fn. 607)</a> but was demolished <em>c</em>. 1248 on
the orders of the king, who awarded its lessee 10
marks a year in compensation. <a href="#fnn608" name="anchorn608">(fn. 608)</a> In 1267, however, he allowed it to be reinstated, <a href="#fnn609" name="anchorn609">(fn. 609)</a> and an Etloe
man owned a forge in 1282 and another was held
by two Blakeney men. <a href="#fnn610" name="anchorn610">(fn. 610)</a> The Etloe forge was
presumably responsible for the large quantity of
cinders that in 1749 was reported to have been
dug out of the roadways in the south part of the
tithing. <a href="#fnn611" name="anchorn611">(fn. 611)</a> A field called Cinders near Northington <a href="#fnn612" name="anchorn612">(fn. 612)</a> presumably marked another ancient
ironworking site.</p>
			<p><a name="p83"> </a>By the late 13th century a mill had been built
on Blackpool brook above the hamlet of Nibley. <a href="#fnn613" name="anchorn613">(fn. 613)</a> 
It belonged to the Blakeney manor estate <a href="#fnn614" name="anchorn614">(fn. 614)</a> and
was probably the corn mill that James Barrow
rebuilt before 1600. <a href="#fnn615" name="anchorn615">(fn. 615)</a> Shortly before 1656 John
Barrow built an ironmaking furnace at the site, <a href="#fnn616" name="anchorn616">(fn. 616)</a> 
and before 1692 the Barrows sold the furnace to
the ironmaster Paul Foley. Foley (d. 1699) and
his son Thomas operated it with partners until
1715. The furnace was not worked later, though
the Foley family still owned the site in 1740. <a href="#fnn617" name="anchorn617">(fn. 617)</a> 
Ruins of the furnace remained at the end of the
18th century. <a href="#fnn618" name="anchorn618">(fn. 618)</a> By 1841 a wire mill had been
established on the site <a href="#fnn619" name="anchorn619">(fn. 619)</a> and it continued to
operate until 1856 or later. <a href="#fnn620" name="anchorn620">(fn. 620)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p84"> </a>Nibley mill, downstream of the furnace site,
beside the main road, was presumably the water
mill at Nibley with which in 1636 and 1648
members of the Wintle family <a href="#fnn621" name="anchorn621">(fn. 621)</a> and in 1701
Richard Chinn were dealing. <a href="#fnn622" name="anchorn622">(fn. 622)</a> Edward Chinn
owned or occupied Nibley mill in the mid 18th
century <a href="#fnn623" name="anchorn623">(fn. 623)</a> and William Smith owned it in 1794. <a href="#fnn624" name="anchorn624">(fn. 624)</a> 
In the late 19th century it was worked as a corn
mill with a small farm and it apparently went
out of use soon after 1906. <a href="#fnn625" name="anchorn625">(fn. 625)</a> A 17th-century
house, partly timber-framed, and the stone-built
mill remained at the site in 1989.</p>
			<p><a name="p85"> </a>A short way below Nibley mill stood another
mill, having a long mill pond extending back
alongside the main road as far as the junction
with the Blakeney Hill road. It may have been
the new-built grist mill at Blakeney offered for
sale by James Partridge in 1819 when it was
occupied by William Wheeldon. <a href="#fnn626" name="anchorn626">(fn. 626)</a> It was in use
as a corn mill in the late 19th century. <a href="#fnn627" name="anchorn627">(fn. 627)</a> It ceased
to work <em>c</em>. 1900 <a href="#fnn628" name="anchorn628">(fn. 628)</a> and was later converted as a pair
of houses. A small, three-storeyed stone building
on the east side of Sydenham House in Bridge
Street was being worked as a water-powered corn
mill by the owner of the house, the shopkeeper
Alfred Butler, in 1897 and 1906. The mill, which
was presumably supplied by a leat from Blackpool
brook, had been converted as a dwelling by 1989. <a href="#fnn629" name="anchorn629">(fn. 629)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p86"> </a>The lowest of the mills at Blakeney stood at
Millend on the south side of the village on a long
leat running from near the point where Blackpool and Soudley brooks combine to form
Bideford brook. <a href="#fnn630" name="anchorn630">(fn. 630)</a> Millend was the site of a mill
by 1599 <a href="#fnn631" name="anchorn631">(fn. 631)</a> and two mills at Blakeney that John
Buck held under Awre manor <em>c</em>. 1600 possibly
stood there. <a href="#fnn632" name="anchorn632">(fn. 632)</a> Those mills were sold by the lord
of the manor in 1656, apparently to George
Buck, who was then the tenant with his father
John. <a href="#fnn633" name="anchorn633">(fn. 633)</a> From the mid 18th century mills at
Millend were owned with a nearby tannery by
the Hayward family, though usually worked by
lessees. In 1761 the site included a grist mill, a
newly erected bolting mill, and another water
wheel which was offered as convenient for a
skinner. <a href="#fnn634" name="anchorn634">(fn. 634)</a> One part appears to have been used
for a while in the cloth industry, for in 1797
William Price held a grist mill and tuck mill
under the Haywards. Another part was then
occupied by the owners, <a href="#fnn635" name="anchorn635">(fn. 635)</a> presumably the bark
mill that was worked with their tannery in
1806. <a href="#fnn636" name="anchorn636">(fn. 636)</a> The corn mill at Millend was offered for
sale by the Haywards in 1813. <a href="#fnn637" name="anchorn637">(fn. 637)</a> By 1830 Millend
mill belonged to Richard White, <a href="#fnn638" name="anchorn638">(fn. 638)</a> and Stephen
Adolphus White was working it in 1889. <a href="#fnn639" name="anchorn639">(fn. 639)</a> It had
gone out of use by 1901, <a href="#fnn640" name="anchorn640">(fn. 640)</a> and the small stone
mill was occupied as two dwellings in 1989.</p>
			<p><a name="p87"> </a>A steam-powered corn mill at Blakeney was
also held by the White family in the 19th century
and may have been near the Millend water
mill. <a href="#fnn641" name="anchorn641">(fn. 641)</a> Daniel White owned the steam mill in
1830, <a href="#fnn642" name="anchorn642">(fn. 642)</a> and in 1856 the miller was Richard
White, who was also a maltster and farmer. <a href="#fnn643" name="anchorn643">(fn. 643)</a> 
During the 1870s Stephen Adolphus White,
who was then said to have an extensive business
as a corn merchant, worked the steam mill. <a href="#fnn644" name="anchorn644">(fn. 644)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p88"> </a>There was a mill on Awre manor in 1086, <a href="#fnn645" name="anchorn645">(fn. 645)</a> 
possibly the one recorded from 1278 on the
estate of the Awre family, <a href="#fnn646" name="anchorn646">(fn. 646)</a> an offshoot of the
manor. The Awres' mill was apparently that on
Bideford brook just west of Hall Farm. Known
as Hall Mill by 1639 <a href="#fnn647" name="anchorn647">(fn. 647)</a> it was in the same
ownership as Hall Farm until 1731 when
Thomas Blackall sold it to Francis Spring.
Spring worked it as a corn mill in the mid 18th
century, <a href="#fnn648" name="anchorn648">(fn. 648)</a> and his family remained owners until
1834 <a href="#fnn649" name="anchorn649">(fn. 649)</a> but let the mill from the 1770s. <a href="#fnn650" name="anchorn650">(fn. 650)</a> By 1816
it had been converted as a paper mill and was
worked by Joseph Lloyd. Thomas Newel was
making paper there in 1832 and Benjamin Small
of Mitcheldean in 1834, but by 1839 it had been
converted back to a corn mill. <a href="#fnn651" name="anchorn651">(fn. 651)</a> It remained in
use until 1879 <a href="#fnn652" name="anchorn652">(fn. 652)</a> or later. Some ruins of the mill
survived in 1989.</p>
			<p><a name="p89"> </a>At Gatcombe a works making blacksmiths'
anvils was operated by the Foleys and their
partners between 1695 and 1705 and was converted as a corn mill <em>c</em>. 1710; <a href="#fnn653" name="anchorn653">(fn. 653)</a> no later record of
a mill there has been found.</p>
			<p><a name="p90"> </a>Fisheries, principally for salmon, provided an
additional source of income for the owners and
tenants of the manors and farms along the
Severn bank. In 1300 John of Box, one of the
lords of Box manor, had a fishery at the north
end of the parish. <a href="#fnn654" name="anchorn654">(fn. 654)</a> That manor probably owned
the rights in the stretch of river between the
Newnham parish boundary and Hamstalls Pill,
which marked the upper limit of the rights held
by Awre manor. <a href="#fnn655" name="anchorn655">(fn. 655)</a> In 1301 the Mortimers' share
of Awre manor included fisheries at Hamstalls
and Woodend, <a href="#fnn656" name="anchorn656">(fn. 656)</a> and in the 1320s and 1330s the
fisheries were a valuable asset of the manor. In
the year 1328-9 a fishery in hand produced 53<em>s</em>.
9¼<em>d</em>., while one at Hamstalls was leased for 13<em>s</em>.
4<em>d</em>., and in 1332-3 the lord received 100<em>s</em>. from
his fisheries. The fishermen who worked them
under Lord Berkeley also served as manorial
bailiffs, and a fish court was held, presumably
to deal with poachers. <a href="#fnn657" name="anchorn657">(fn. 657)</a> In 1493 the manor
fisheries included one called 'Pucherewe', evidently a putcher weir (wickerwork fish traps on
a framework of wooden stakes), and a tenant
held rights called the gale, <a href="#fnn658" name="anchorn658">(fn. 658)</a> the lord's share in
cash or kind of the catch of the fishermen. <a href="#fnn659" name="anchorn659">(fn. 659)</a> In
the 18th century the gale of fishing on Awre
manor was usually leased by the lords to a
consortium of tenants. <a href="#fnn660" name="anchorn660">(fn. 660)</a> The lords of the manor
also enjoyed the right to all royal fish, <a href="#fnn661" name="anchorn661">(fn. 661)</a> which
was exercised in the 1590s and <em>c</em>. 1802 when
sturgeon were caught. <a href="#fnn662" name="anchorn662">(fn. 662)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p91"> </a>In the 18th century and later the main fisheries
of Awre tithing were a series of putcher weirs,
most of them on the stretch of river between the
Hayward and Brimspill. In the same part of the
parish the long net, recorded from 1561, was
also in regular use. <a href="#fnn663" name="anchorn663">(fn. 663)</a> The Baderon family had
owned a fishery in 1332 and later, <a href="#fnn664" name="anchorn664">(fn. 664)</a> presumably
attached to the Hayward estate whose later
owners claimed rights. <a href="#fnn665" name="anchorn665">(fn. 665)</a> Several weirs belonged
to the Hopkinses' Woodend estate in 1747, <a href="#fnn666" name="anchorn666">(fn. 666)</a> and
in 1851 the right to one in the same area was
being disputed by the lords of the manor and a
Mr. Cadogan, <a href="#fnn667" name="anchorn667">(fn. 667)</a> a member of a family that had
been involved in the Awre fisheries since the
1740s or earlier. <a href="#fnn668" name="anchorn668">(fn. 668)</a> In 1866 a special commission
for fisheries confirmed the right of the lords of
the manor to have three ranks of putchers near
Brimspill and a single rank nearer to Woodend
Lane, and in 1868 the commissioners confirmed
a rank belonging to Thomas Cadogan near
Woodend Lane and one belonging to the Wait
family some way north-east of the lane; together
the various weirs contained a total of 977 putchers. <a href="#fnn669" name="anchorn669">(fn. 669)</a> The lords of the manor sold their rights to
the Cadogans in the 1920s, and members of the
family owned and worked the four ranks that
were in use in 1989; by that time the traditional
wickerwork putchers were being replaced by
those made of steel wire. The lave net was also
used off Awre in 1989 but the use of the long
net there had been given up. <a href="#fnn670" name="anchorn670">(fn. 670)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p92"> </a>In 1547 the gale of fishing between Brimspill and
Gatcombe Pill belonged to Poulton manor, <a href="#fnn671" name="anchorn671">(fn. 671)</a> and
rights in that stretch of river descended with the
manor to the Hagloe estate. <a href="#fnn672" name="anchorn672">(fn. 672)</a> In 1770 and 1779
James Thomas, lord of Poulton, leased to groups
of fishermen the right to use the long net, lave
net, stop net, or any other kind of net, reserving
the right to royal fish, which he claimed for the
manor, and to putcher weirs, which were apparently attached to individual farms. Changes in
the river could evidently much affect the size of
the catch, and the lease of 1770 provided for the
rent to be raised from £5 to £12 if a shift of the
channel caused a pool to form below Brimspill. <a href="#fnn673" name="anchorn673">(fn. 673)</a> 
In 1737 a house at Gatcombe belonging to the
Oatfield Farm estate, probably the later Sloop
inn, had a fishery attached, and ranks of putchers
were leased with Poulton Court in 1792. <a href="#fnn674" name="anchorn674">(fn. 674)</a> About
1913 the tenant of Poulton Court had <em>c</em>. 600
putchers in the river adjoining the farm. <a href="#fnn675" name="anchorn675">(fn. 675)</a> The
farmer still operated a rank there in 1989, while
at Gatcombe two ranks were worked by the
owners of the Court House, who had bought
rights from the Hagloe estate <em>c</em>. 1979. <a href="#fnn676" name="anchorn676">(fn. 676)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p93"> </a>A fishery belonging to Etloe Duchy manor in
1283 <a href="#fnn677" name="anchorn677">(fn. 677)</a> presumably comprised rights below Gatcombe. The right to use two stop nets (large nets
operated from boats held on cables broadside to
the tide) was confirmed to the owner of the
Duchy manor in 1866; one net was used off
Purton and the other between Purton and Gatcombe. <a href="#fnn678" name="anchorn678">(fn. 678)</a> From 1878 the rights belonging to
Etloe Duchy, together with rights of the
Bathurst family to use stop nets in Wellhouse
Bay below Purton, in Lydney, were leased by
Charles Morse, owner of the Court House at
Gatcombe. His descendants, who later bought
the rights, worked the fishery from Gatcombe
for the next 100 years, and in the 1920s owned
10 stopping boats. The boats, which were built
and repaired in outbuildings at the Court House,
usually took up their station in Wellhouse Bay,
where a building called the fish house provided
accommodation for the fishermen during the
season. Most of the salmon caught were sent by
rail to London. Three boats were kept at Gatcombe by Mrs. Ann Bayliss (nee Morse) in 1989
but they had not been used for about three years
due to difficulties in getting them repaired and
renewing the nets. <a href="#fnn679" name="anchorn679">(fn. 679)</a> In 1922 over 70 men from
Blakeney and the surrounding area fished with
lave nets off Gatcombe, selling their catch to the
Morses, <a href="#fnn680" name="anchorn680">(fn. 680)</a> and a few men still used lave nets there
in 1989.</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-0006">Other Industry and Trade.</h3>
			<p><a name="p94"> </a>A salt pan, producing 30 packloads of salt, was recorded among
the assets of Awre manor in 1086. <a href="#fnn681" name="anchorn681">(fn. 681)</a> The pan,
and a salt house mentioned <em>c</em>. 1600, <a href="#fnn682" name="anchorn682">(fn. 682)</a> were
evidently near the river bank at Woodend, where
they were later recalled by the name Salthouse
orchard. <a href="#fnn683" name="anchorn683">(fn. 683)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p95"> </a>Trade on the river Severn employed the men
of Awre parish from at least 1282 when two
inhabitants were accused of using their boats to
carry wood stolen from the Forest to Bristol and
elsewhere. <a href="#fnn684" name="anchorn684">(fn. 684)</a> In 1354 the profits of Awre rectory
included offerings given by merchants voyaging
overseas. <a href="#fnn685" name="anchorn685">(fn. 685)</a> Goods were landed or loaded at
various places on the river bank, including Brimspill and Hamstalls. <a href="#fnn686" name="anchorn686">(fn. 686)</a> Eight of 11 sailors listed
in the parish in 1608 lived in Awre tithing, <a href="#fnn687" name="anchorn687">(fn. 687)</a> 
suggesting that considerable trade was then carried on from that part of the parish. Possibly
there was then a regular landing at Woodend,
which erosion of the bank later made difficult to
use. Vessels brought limestone to Woodend in
the 1820s when there was a limekiln near the
end of Woodend Lane, <a href="#fnn688" name="anchorn688">(fn. 688)</a> and later in the century
and in the early 20th Bristol and Chepstow stone
for roadmaking was landed there. <a href="#fnn689" name="anchorn689">(fn. 689)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p96"> </a>Most of the trade was concentrated on the
small hamlet of Gatcombe, where there was a
sheltered anchorage for larger vessels, as well as
a pill into which smaller boats could be drawn.
Much trade entering the Severn came no higher
than Gatcombe, the larger vessels preferring not
to encounter the dangerous sandbanks further
upstream, and for several centuries Gatcombe
was one of Gloucester's chief outlets for maritime trade. <a href="#fnn690" name="anchorn690">(fn. 690)</a> The hamlet had the status of a creek
of the port of Bristol in 1479 when a Gatcombe
vessel was trading in fish from Ireland, <a href="#fnn691" name="anchorn691">(fn. 691)</a> and
custom dues taken at Gatcombe creek were
granted to a royal servant in 1485. <a href="#fnn692" name="anchorn692">(fn. 692)</a> Gatcombe
figured largely in litigation between the cities of
Gloucester and Bristol which followed the creation of a new port based on Gloucester in 1580.
Differing views were advanced as to its value as
a haven, some maintaining that at spring tides
ships of up to 80 tons could lie there and others
that it could safely be used only by ships of up
to 40 tons, but its importance to Gloucester was
made clear. Trade with Ireland in fish and other
commodities was carried on, as well as some
trade with the Continent. In the early 1580s a
customs officer, based at Newnham by the
officials of the new port, attended regularly at
Gatcombe to search vessels. <a href="#fnn693" name="anchorn693">(fn. 693)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p97"> </a>A reference to a mariner of Gatcombe who
died in 1669 <a href="#fnn694" name="anchorn694">(fn. 694)</a> is one of the few records found of
the hamlet's role in the river trade in the 17th
century. At the beginning of the 18th century
iron from Blakeney furnace was shipped there
for Bristol and for the Midlands. <a href="#fnn695" name="anchorn695">(fn. 695)</a> Goods for
Gloucester merchants and tradesmen continued to pass through Gatcombe throughout the
18th century with trade in copper and maltsters'
coal from the South Wales ports becoming
particularly important. <a href="#fnn696" name="anchorn696">(fn. 696)</a> At the end of the century a Birmingham copper company used
Gatcombe as a transit point, establishing a
warehouse there. <a href="#fnn697" name="anchorn697">(fn. 697)</a> One or two Gatcombe vessels
were involved in the regular trade carried on
between the Severn and Ireland, chiefly in oak
bark and cider. In the 1760s and 1770s James
Thomas of Oatfield Farm traded with South
Wales and Ireland, his boats including the
<em>Susanna</em> and the <em>John Birkin</em> named after his
wife and son; <a href="#fnn698" name="anchorn698">(fn. 698)</a> J. B. Thomas was dealing in bark,
probably for the Irish trade, in 1789. <a href="#fnn699" name="anchorn699">(fn. 699)</a> In the
early and mid 18th century several generations
of the Cupitt family were mariners and merchants at Gatcombe, <a href="#fnn700" name="anchorn700">(fn. 700)</a> and in the late 18th and
early 19th the Barretts, including Richard Barrett, owner of two sloops which were lost in a
gale in 1775, were among mariners there. <a href="#fnn701" name="anchorn701">(fn. 701)</a> 
About 1790 five sloops and a brig were based at
the hamlet. <a href="#fnn702" name="anchorn702">(fn. 702)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p98"> </a>In the late 18th century and the early 19th
Gatcombe was a centre of the timber trade.
During the Napoleonic Wars it was one of the
main shipping points for the oak timber sent
from the Forest to the naval dockyards. <a href="#fnn703" name="anchorn703">(fn. 703)</a> A navy
purveyor living at Blakeney in 1801 <a href="#fnn704" name="anchorn704">(fn. 704)</a> and a
timber haulier of Etloe mentioned in 1809 were
among those employed in that trade. <a href="#fnn705" name="anchorn705">(fn. 705)</a> At a place
called Milking mead, a narrow coombe in the
cliffs just upstream from Gatcombe, a timber
yard belonged to the Oatfield Farm estate in the
early 1790s when there was a wharf and warehouse adjoining; <a href="#fnn706" name="anchorn706">(fn. 706)</a> in 1843 a small dwelling there
was described as formerly a barkhouse <a href="#fnn707" name="anchorn707">(fn. 707)</a> and had
presumably been used by the Thomases in the
Irish trade. William Ambrose, owner of Oatfield
and the Hagloe estate from 1810, traded as a
timber merchant <a href="#fnn708" name="anchorn708">(fn. 708)</a> and had the yard in hand in
the 1830s. Another, larger yard, called Gatcombe timber yard, occupied a field on the west
side of the hamlet; <a href="#fnn709" name="anchorn709">(fn. 709)</a> a gully in the cliffs enabled
the timber to be lowered to the water's edge,
where a small stone-built, high-water quay was
constructed sometime during the early or mid
19th century. <a href="#fnn710" name="anchorn710">(fn. 710)</a> In the early 19th century Gatcombe timber yard was occupied by a Chepstow
timber company, which was succeeded as tenant
by William Ambrose; in 1831 he sublet it to the
Commissioners of the Navy. <a href="#fnn711" name="anchorn711">(fn. 711)</a> There was another
yard at the south end of the parish where timber
was collected for shipping from Purton. <a href="#fnn712" name="anchorn712">(fn. 712)</a> At
Milking mead a ruined limekiln survived next
to the former timber yard in 1989, recalling
another trade once carried on. <a href="#fnn713" name="anchorn713">(fn. 713)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p99"> </a>Twelve mariners and three watermen, together with a number of mariners' wives, whose
husbands were evidently away at sea, were
enumerated in the parish in 1851. Most lived in
Etloe and Hagloe tithings <a href="#fnn714" name="anchorn714">(fn. 714)</a> and were associated
with the trade at Gatcombe, which was enjoying
its final period of activity. The South Wales
railway line, then under construction along the
foreshore, obstructed access to the timber yards
and cut off the mouth of the pill with a low
viaduct. A few mariners and pilots still lived in
Awre parish in the later 19th century and the early
20th, <a href="#fnn715" name="anchorn715">(fn. 715)</a> some probably employed in vessels using
the nearby Lydney and Bullo Pill harbours.</p>
			<p><a name="p100"> </a>Shipbuilding was established in the parish by
1608 when shipwrights were living in Blakeney
and Hagloe and a ship carpenter in Etloe; <a href="#fnn716" name="anchorn716">(fn. 716)</a> a
shipwright of Blakeney was mentioned in 1662. <a href="#fnn717" name="anchorn717">(fn. 717)</a> 
All were perhaps employed at Gatcombe, where
several vessels were built in the mid 17th century. <a href="#fnn718" name="anchorn718">(fn. 718)</a> In 1787 J. B. Thomas and a partner
owned a shipbuilding yard, probably at Milking
mead, and launched a brig of over 300 tons. <a href="#fnn719" name="anchorn719">(fn. 719)</a> In
1804 when Thomas offered the yard for letting
he claimed that vesels of over 600 tons had been
built there. <a href="#fnn720" name="anchorn720">(fn. 720)</a> Snows of 198 and 129 tons built in
1803 and 1834 respectively were probably more
typical of the vessels built at Gatcombe. The
latter boat was built by James and Thomas
Shaw, <a href="#fnn721" name="anchorn721">(fn. 721)</a> who in 1839 occupied a building below
Gatcombe timber yard, close to the site of the
quay mentioned above. <a href="#fnn722" name="anchorn722">(fn. 722)</a> Members of the Shaw
family were still boatbuilders in the parish in the
1850s, <a href="#fnn723" name="anchorn723">(fn. 723)</a> though the railway line presumably
prevented the building of all but very small craft
at Gatcombe. In 1851 there was also a boatyard
at Hamstalls, where a shipwright Charles Cooper was employing 18 workers; <a href="#fnn724" name="anchorn724">(fn. 724)</a> it apparently
closed soon afterwards.</p>
			<p><a name="p101"> </a>Apart from that connected with the river, the
trade and industry of Awre parish was concentrated on Blakeney village, where the streams
provided water for mills (described above) and
tanneries and the main Gloucester-Chepstow
road stimulated commerce. By the beginning of
the 18th century - on what authority is not
known - fairs were held at Blakeney on May
Day and All Saints <a href="#fnn725" name="anchorn725">(fn. 725)</a> (altered in 1752 to 12 May
and 12 November). In the mid 18th century, <a href="#fnn726" name="anchorn726">(fn. 726)</a> 
and until they lapsed in the early 20th, they dealt
principally in livestock. <a href="#fnn727" name="anchorn727">(fn. 727)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p102"> </a>Blakeney's role as a centre for crafts and trade
had apparently begun by the 1270s and early
1280s when there was a smith, a weaver, and a
baker in Blakeney tithing and a baker and butchers in Etloe tithing, <a href="#fnn728" name="anchorn728">(fn. 728)</a> in which the south part of
the village lay. In 1608 32 tradesmen were listed
in Blakeney and Etloe tithings, compared to only
9 in the other parts of the parish. Apart from the
usual village craftsmen, the tradesmen in Blakeney and Etloe included 2 grindstone hewers,
possibly working in quarries on Blakeney hill in
the adjoining extraparochial Forest, 5 nailers, 4
weavers, a mercer, and a tanner. <a href="#fnn729" name="anchorn729">(fn. 729)</a> Nailmaking
may have had a continuous existence at Blakeney
until the mid 19th century, though only sporadic
references have been found. <a href="#fnn730" name="anchorn730">(fn. 730)</a> Weavers were
recorded there until the early 18th century <a href="#fnn731" name="anchorn731">(fn. 731)</a> and,
as mentioned above, later in that century there
was probably a fulling mill at Millend. <a href="#fnn732" name="anchorn732">(fn. 732)</a> In 1649,
at a time when much wood was being taken
illegally from the royal demesne woodlands of
the Forest, 5 timber dealers and 2 cardboard
makers were recorded at Blakeney. <a href="#fnn733" name="anchorn733">(fn. 733)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p103"> </a>Tanning, an industry associated with the Forest bark trade, was again recorded at Blakeney
in 1655, 1682, and 1711. <a href="#fnn734" name="anchorn734">(fn. 734)</a> A tanhouse in Etloe
tithing, apparently at Millend, belonged to the
Barrows of Blakeney manor in 1721. In the 1750s
it was occupied by William Swayne, one of a
family which owned a tannery at Underhill, in
Newnham. <a href="#fnn735" name="anchorn735">(fn. 735)</a> By 1763 Thomas Hayward occupied it, <a href="#fnn736" name="anchorn736">(fn. 736)</a> and he or another Thomas Hayward
died, a prosperous man, in 1797, leaving the
business to his son John. <a href="#fnn737" name="anchorn737">(fn. 737)</a> John offered the
tannery for letting in 1806. <a href="#fnn738" name="anchorn738">(fn. 738)</a> Tanning continued
at Blakeney until 1865 or later. <a href="#fnn739" name="anchorn739">(fn. 739)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p104"> </a>The numbers of tradesmen and shopkeepers
increased in the early 19th century as Blakeney
began to serve the growing Forest settlements
on the hillsides above, as well as benefiting from
the increase in traffic on the turnpike road.
Blakeney acquired some of the features of a small
town, though its trades and crafts were generally
of a humble character. In 1851 142 tradesmen,
craftsmen, and shopkeepers were enumerated in
Blakeney and Etloe tithings, with over 40 different trades represented. <a href="#fnn740" name="anchorn740">(fn. 740)</a> A brewery was opened
before 1870 and was worked until <em>c</em>. 1915. <a href="#fnn741" name="anchorn741">(fn. 741)</a> 
There was a branch bank by 1897. <a href="#fnn742" name="anchorn742">(fn. 742)</a> The village
derived little benefit from the mineral railway
built through it to the Forest and opened in
1868, <a href="#fnn743" name="anchorn743">(fn. 743)</a> but the growth of motor transport in the
early 20th century helped to maintain trade and
supported a garage by 1927. <a href="#fnn744" name="anchorn744">(fn. 744)</a> In 1931 20 shopkeepers and 15 other tradesmen or small
businessmen were listed in the village, <a href="#fnn745" name="anchorn745">(fn. 745)</a> but in
the mid 20th century its role declined, partly as
a result of the growth of Lydney as a business
and shopping centre. In 1989 business activity
in Blakeney was limited to 8 shops, 2 public
houses, a restaurant, a garage, and a building
firm.</p>
			<p><a name="p105"> </a>The parts of the parish outside Blakeney village had few rural tradesmen. In the late 19th
century and the early 20th Awre village had one
or two shopkeepers and a blacksmith, and the
rural part of Etloe had one or two craftsmen. <a href="#fnn746" name="anchorn746">(fn. 746)</a> 
			</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-0007">LOCAL GOVERNMENT.</h3>
			<p><a name="p106"> </a>In 1276 the lords
of Awre manor claimed the right to return of writs,
pleas of <em>vee de naam</em>, the assize of bread and ale,
and gallows. <a href="#fnn747" name="anchorn747">(fn. 747)</a> The gallows belonging to the
lords, who also held Bledisloe hundred, were
presumably at Gallows green in Bledisloe tithing
beside the Gloucester-Chepstow road. <a href="#fnn748" name="anchorn748">(fn. 748)</a> In 1741
the lords of Awre and Etloe manor also claimed
estrays, felons' and fugitives' goods, and wrecks; <a href="#fnn749" name="anchorn749">(fn. 749)</a> 
a wreck was adjudged to belong to the lords in
1727 <a href="#fnn750" name="anchorn750">(fn. 750)</a> and the dangerous waters off Awre Point
made it a franchise that they could often exercise.</p>
			<p><a name="p107"> </a>View of frankpledge was also claimed, and
court rolls for the leet and court baron survive
for 1588 and for the years 1594-1600; <a href="#fnn751" name="anchorn751">(fn. 751)</a> there are
also rolls and full sets of court papers for the
years 1688-1881. In the late 17th century joint
courts leet and baron were held twice a year but
from <em>c</em>. 1700 only one a year was held, with
separate courts baron when required for the
surrenders and admissions of the customary
tenants. The October leet continued until 1881
but the court baron was held only every other
year from 1800 until 1864, after which tenures
were dealt with at the offices of the Gloucester
solicitors who were stewards of the manor. <a href="#fnn752" name="anchorn752">(fn. 752)</a> In
the 1670s one of the biannual courts met at Awre
and the other at Blakeney but in the 18th century
the court usually met at Blakeney. <a href="#fnn753" name="anchorn753">(fn. 753)</a> In 1808,
however, an inn at Awre, presumably the Red
Hart, was described as the accustomed meeting
place <a href="#fnn754" name="anchorn754">(fn. 754)</a> and the Red Hart was the usual venue
later.</p>
			<p><a name="p108"> </a>In the court two homages made presentments,
one for Awre and one for Etloe with the part of
Bledisloe that belonged to the manor, but there
was one leet jury for the whole manor. The
numbers and descriptions of the manorial
officers elected in the court varied but in the
early 18th century they were usually two constables for Awre and a tithingman each for
Awre, Etloe, and Bledisloe. The upkeep of the
reens and sea walls of Awre tithing occupied
much of the court's time. <a href="#fnn755" name="anchorn755">(fn. 755)</a> Such matters were
also the responsibility of the Commissioners of
Sewers for the Upper Level of the Severn in
whose jurisdiction Awre was included. In the
early 18th century the commissioners' court
employed a surveyor at Awre and made orders
for repairs, <a href="#fnn756" name="anchorn756">(fn. 756)</a> but in 1712, after distress was taken
from some tenants to enforce payment of a rate,
local dissatisfaction with the commissioners led
the Awre and Etloe court leet to inaugurate its
own system for the upkeep of the walls and
appoint its own surveyors. <a href="#fnn757" name="anchorn757">(fn. 757)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p109"> </a>Rolls of the court baron for Bledisloe manor
survive for 1620, 1671, 1704, 1743, 1801, 1813,
and 1819. <a href="#fnn758" name="anchorn758">(fn. 758)</a> There is a roll of 1819 for Poulton
manor court, which then claimed leet jurisdiction and elected a constable for Hagloe tithing. <a href="#fnn759" name="anchorn759">(fn. 759)</a> 
A court baron for Etloe Duchy manor was held
at the Ship inn (later the Court House) at
Gatcombe in 1821. <a href="#fnn760" name="anchorn760">(fn. 760)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p110"> </a>Early records of parish government surviving are
churchwardens' accounts for 1670-1722, <a href="#fnn761" name="anchorn761">(fn. 761)</a> overseers' accounts for 1717-75, <a href="#fnn762" name="anchorn762">(fn. 762)</a> and vestry minutes
from 1770. <a href="#fnn763" name="anchorn763">(fn. 763)</a> The parish had two churchwardens, one chosen by the vicar and the other by
the vestry, and in the 18th century the one
chosen by the vestry had particular responsibility for Blakeney chapel and was sometimes
called the chapelwarden. <a href="#fnn764" name="anchorn764">(fn. 764)</a> The six tithings each
repaired their own roads, appointing separate
surveyors, <a href="#fnn765" name="anchorn765">(fn. 765)</a> and there were three overseers of the
poor, one for Awre, one for Hagloe and Bledisloe, and one for Blakeney and the two Etloe
tithings. <a href="#fnn766" name="anchorn766">(fn. 766)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p111"> </a>In 1683 the church house in Awre village was
used as a poorhouse and a pauper was housed
in a cottage there owned by the parish. The
church house at Blakeney had also been used for
the poor but by 1683 the Barrow family, owners
of the manor, had appropriated it to their own
use. <a href="#fnn767" name="anchorn767">(fn. 767)</a> Measures for poor relief taken by the
parish authorities in the later 18th century included employing women at spinning flax, <a href="#fnn768" name="anchorn768">(fn. 768)</a> 
apprenticing pauper children, and paying a subscription to the Gloucester infirmary. A plan
made in 1791 to build a workhouse to hold 50
paupers was evidently not implemented. In 1821
measures were taken for more efficient management of the poor, a building was adapted as a
workhouse in 1822, and the poor were put out
to farm in 1823. The measures reflected a sharp
rise in the number of paupers. About 20 adults
and some children were receiving regular weekly
relief in the 1770s; between the late 1780s and
1810 <em>c</em>. 40 paupers were usually on relief and by
the early 1820s the numbers had risen to over
70. <a href="#fnn769" name="anchorn769">(fn. 769)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p112"> </a>In 1835 the parish was included in the Westbury-on-Severn poor-law union. <a href="#fnn770" name="anchorn770">(fn. 770)</a> In 1863 a
local board of health was formed for the parish,
holding its meetings at Blakeney. <a href="#fnn771" name="anchorn771">(fn. 771)</a> The board,
which employed one officer as its surveyor and
inspector of nuisances, initially a joint appointment with the Westbury and Newnham boards,
and another as rate collector, was almost entirely
concerned with the upkeep of the roads, even
after its assumption of the powers of an urban
sanitary authority. It was replaced by an urban
district council under the Act of 1894. <a href="#fnn772" name="anchorn772">(fn. 772)</a> The
urban district, which also did little for the
provision or improvement of public services,
was abolished in 1935. <a href="#fnn773" name="anchorn773">(fn. 773)</a> Apart from the area
added to West Dean parish, Awre parish then
became part of the East Dean rural district, <a href="#fnn774" name="anchorn774">(fn. 774)</a> 
with which it was included in the Forest of Dean
district in 1974.</p>

			<p><a name="p113"> </a>Awre had a church, with I yardland attached to it, in 1086. <a href="#fnn775" name="anchorn775">(fn. 775)</a> Robert son of
Hugh, who held Awre manor in the 1140s,
granted the church to Monmouth priory, and <em>c</em>.
1150 the gift was confirmed by his overlord
Roger, earl of Hereford, and by the diocesan,
the bishop of Hereford, who licensed the priory
to appropriate the church on the death of the
then rector. <a href="#fnn776" name="anchorn776">(fn. 776)</a> The grant to Monmouth was
possibly nullified on Earl Roger's rebellion or
perhaps was never implemented; no later evidence of any connexion with the priory has been
found, and in 1226 the church remained a
rectory in the gift of the Crown, owner of the
manor. <a href="#fnn777" name="anchorn777">(fn. 777)</a> In 1278 the earls of Gloucester and
Pembroke, owners of portions of the manor,
agreed to make alternate presentations. There
were then other claimants to the advowson, <a href="#fnn778" name="anchorn778">(fn. 778)</a> 
which was evidently in dispute in the early 14th
century: the bishop collated to the rectory in
1302 and the rector appointed then had a presentation from the Crown in 1307. <a href="#fnn779" name="anchorn779">(fn. 779)</a> Thomas of
Berkeley, lord of the manor, presented in 1349, <a href="#fnn780" name="anchorn780">(fn. 780)</a> 
and in 1351 he gave Awre church to Llanthony
priory, Gloucester, in exchange for the manor
of Coaley, the priory having licence to appropriate the church. A vicarage was ordained in 1354 <a href="#fnn781" name="anchorn781">(fn. 781)</a> 
and the living remained a vicarage. An ancient
chapel at Blakeney had the status of a perpetual
curacy after receiving an endowment in the mid
17th century and became the centre of a separate
ecclesiastical district in 1853. <a href="#fnn782" name="anchorn782">(fn. 782)</a> In 1952 the livings of Awre and Blakeney were united, <a href="#fnn783" name="anchorn783">(fn. 783)</a> and in
1982 they were made a united benefice with
Newnham vicarage. <a href="#fnn784" name="anchorn784">(fn. 784)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p114"> </a>The advowson of Awre vicarage passed with
Llanthony priory's rectory estate to the James
family and to the Haberdashers' Company. <a href="#fnn785" name="anchorn785">(fn. 785)</a> In
1545, however, it was exercised by William
Francombe under a grant from Llanthony for
one turn, <a href="#fnn786" name="anchorn786">(fn. 786)</a> and in 1568 Robert Alfield of
Gloucester presented under a grant from Edward Barnard of Flaxley, whose right possibly
also derived from a grant by Llanthony. <a href="#fnn787" name="anchorn787">(fn. 787)</a> In
1982 the Haberdashers' Company and the
bishop of Gloucester were assigned alternate
presentations to the united benefice. <a href="#fnn788" name="anchorn788">(fn. 788)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p115"> </a>Under the ordination of the vicarage in 1354
Llanthony priory retained all the great tithes, a
barn and threshing floor, and some mortuaries,
while the vicar was awarded the glebe house,
glebe lands, small tithes, and other profits. <a href="#fnn789" name="anchorn789">(fn. 789)</a> In
1418 a disagreement between the vicar and the
priory over the division of the mortuaries was
resolved, <a href="#fnn790" name="anchorn790">(fn. 790)</a> and in 1479 the vicar and priory
secured a confirmation of the original endowment. <a href="#fnn791" name="anchorn791">(fn. 791)</a> The mode of tithing the putcher weirs
on the river bank was in dispute in 1625: the
vicar claimed a tithe of the total catch from each,
but the fishermen claimed that by custom he
worked the weir on his own account one day in
every ten, taking whatever was trapped then. <a href="#fnn792" name="anchorn792">(fn. 792)</a> 
In 1699 the vicar's tithes were mostly taken in
kind, with cash payments fixed only for milk,
cider, garden produce, and wood. <a href="#fnn793" name="anchorn793">(fn. 793)</a> In 1769 the
vicar refused to accept the validity of those
moduses and established his right to take the
tithes in kind. <a href="#fnn794" name="anchorn794">(fn. 794)</a> In 1839, when a third portion
of them was on lease to the curate of Blakeney,
the small tithes were commuted for a total corn
rent charge of £450 7<em>s</em>. 2<em>d</em>. <a href="#fnn795" name="anchorn795">(fn. 795)</a> In the 17th century
the vicar's glebe comprised a few parcels in the
common meadows and open fields and some
small closes, <a href="#fnn796" name="anchorn796">(fn. 796)</a> and following inclosure in 1796 it
amounted to 8 a. <a href="#fnn797" name="anchorn797">(fn. 797)</a> The vicarage house, east of
Northington Lane, was rebuilt as a substantial
three-storeyed dwelling in the early 19th century. The vicars of the united benefice lived at
Blakeney after 1952 and at Newnham after
1982. <a href="#fnn798" name="anchorn798">(fn. 798)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p116"> </a>In 1657 the Haberdashers' Company, under a
bequest made to it by a Mr. Hammond for
purchasing impropriate rectories and augmenting livings, bought the lay rectory of Awre and
used the great tithes to augment the vicarage and
endow Blakeney chapel. Under the terms of
Hammond's bequest the incumbent of any living
so augmented was required to hold no other
benefice, to be absent from his cure no more than
40 days in a year, and to preach at least once a
Sunday. <a href="#fnn799" name="anchorn799">(fn. 799)</a> After 1657 the parish was divided into
two roughly equal parts for the collection of the
great tithes, those from one division being assigned to the vicar and those from the other to
the curate of Blakeney. That arrangement, under
which vicar and curate shared the cost of maintaining the chancel of the parish church,
continued <a href="#fnn800" name="anchorn800">(fn. 800)</a> until <em>c</em>. 1780. The Haberdashers
then granted a lease of all the tithes to the vicar
who was to pay £50 a year to the curate of
Blakeney, <a href="#fnn801" name="anchorn801">(fn. 801)</a> and before 1839 another arrangement was made by which the vicar held two
thirds of the great tithes and the curate one third,
while the vicar leased to the curate one third of
his small tithes. The great tithes were commuted
in 1839 for a total corn rent charge of £400. <a href="#fnn802" name="anchorn802">(fn. 802)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p117"> </a>In 1291 Awre church was valued at £40. <a href="#fnn803" name="anchorn803">(fn. 803)</a> The
vicarage was worth £10 4<em>s</em>. 7<em>d</em>. in 1535 <a href="#fnn804" name="anchorn804">(fn. 804)</a> and £48
in 1650. <a href="#fnn805" name="anchorn805">(fn. 805)</a> About 1710 and in 1750 it was worth
£100, about half the value being derived from
the portion of the great tithes, <a href="#fnn806" name="anchorn806">(fn. 806)</a> and in 1856 it
was worth £572. <a href="#fnn807" name="anchorn807">(fn. 807)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p118"> </a>Among early incumbents of Awre, Walter
Blund and Henry of Awre, who succeeded Walter in 1226, were from local landowning
families. <a href="#fnn808" name="anchorn808">(fn. 808)</a> Thomas of Berkeley's steward William
of Syde <a href="#fnn809" name="anchorn809">(fn. 809)</a> was rector from 1349 until the grant to
Llanthony in 1351. <a href="#fnn810" name="anchorn810">(fn. 810)</a> John Winston, vicar in the
early 1520s, was several times proceeded against
by the diocesan authorities for immorality. <a href="#fnn811" name="anchorn811">(fn. 811)</a> In
1548 the vicar Anthony Aldwyn had failed to
read the homilies or preach quarterly sermons. <a href="#fnn812" name="anchorn812">(fn. 812)</a> 
His curate Philip Huling <a href="#fnn813" name="anchorn813">(fn. 813)</a> succeeded to the
vicarage in 1553, was deprived in 1554, and was
reinstated several years before his death <em>c</em>. 1568. <a href="#fnn814" name="anchorn814">(fn. 814)</a> 
Huling's successsor John Williams, who failed
in many of his duties and by 1576 had let the
benefice to farm, <a href="#fnn815" name="anchorn815">(fn. 815)</a> later lost possession of the
vicarage and was claiming it at the institution of
John Street in 1581. Henry James, a relation of
the patron, was instituted in 1636 <a href="#fnn816" name="anchorn816">(fn. 816)</a> and died in
1643 after being imprisoned by parliamentary
troops. <a href="#fnn817" name="anchorn817">(fn. 817)</a> Jonathan Bird held the living in 1650
and died in 1653. <a href="#fnn818" name="anchorn818">(fn. 818)</a> William Marshall was admitted to the living in 1657 and subscribed in 1662,
remaining vicar until his death in 1667. <a href="#fnn819" name="anchorn819">(fn. 819)</a> The
living was later held by two vicars of high church
views, <a href="#fnn820" name="anchorn820">(fn. 820)</a> James Whiting who served from 1671
to <em>c</em>. 1677 when he was drowned at Purton
passage, and Charles Chapman who served from
1677 to 1707. <a href="#fnn821" name="anchorn821">(fn. 821)</a> Jackman Morse, vicar 1721-65,
held the living with Huntley rectory from
1727, <a href="#fnn822" name="anchorn822">(fn. 822)</a> in spite of the terms under which the
benefice had been augmented. He did, however,
remain resident at Awre, as did Charles Sandiford, <a href="#fnn823" name="anchorn823">(fn. 823)</a> vicar 1780-1826, who was also curate of
Blakeney from 1786, vicar of Tirley from 1788,
and archdeacon of Wells from 1815. His successor at Awre, Joseph Malpas, <a href="#fnn824" name="anchorn824">(fn. 824)</a> remained vicar for
the next 50 years. <a href="#fnn825" name="anchorn825">(fn. 825)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p119"> </a>In the 18th century and the earlier 19th many
parishioners worshipped at both the parish
church and Blakeney chapel; in the 1790s most
of the owners of farmhouses had pews at both
places. <a href="#fnn826" name="anchorn826">(fn. 826)</a> In 1750 full Sunday services were held
at the parish church with an afternoon service
at Blakeney, <a href="#fnn827" name="anchorn827">(fn. 827)</a> and in 1825 one service was held
at each on Sunday, morning and afternoon
alternately. At the latter date Blakeney was said
to attract congregations of 400-500, compared to
50-60 at Awre. <a href="#fnn828" name="anchorn828">(fn. 828)</a> On the Sunday of the ecclesiastical census in 1851 Blakeney's congregations
of 211 in the morning and 231 in the afternoon
were more than twice those at Awre. <a href="#fnn829" name="anchorn829">(fn. 829)</a> From the
1760s some inhabitants of the adjoining Forest
hamlets were married and baptized in the parish,
presumably at Blakeney chapel, and were buried
at the parish church. It was probably from 1820,
when a grant from the Crown aided rebuilding,
that some free sittings in Blakeney chapel were
appropriated to Forest inhabitants, but in 1835
they were said never to have made use of them. <a href="#fnn830" name="anchorn830">(fn. 830)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p120"> </a>In the early 18th century there was said to have
once been a chapel at Poulton Court. <a href="#fnn831" name="anchorn831">(fn. 831)</a> No other
record has been found and the supposition may
have been suggested by the fact that the rectory
was sometimes called the rectory of Awre and
Poulton, the vicarage often being similarly designated. <a href="#fnn832" name="anchorn832">(fn. 832)</a> That usage, at least for the rectory, may
derive only from the existence of rectory tithe
barns at both places. <a href="#fnn833" name="anchorn833">(fn. 833)</a> There was a chantry dedicated to the Virgin Mary in Awre church by
1339; <a href="#fnn834" name="anchorn834">(fn. 834)</a> its lands were sold by the Crown in 1563. <a href="#fnn835" name="anchorn835">(fn. 835)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p121"> </a>The parish church of <em>ST. ANDREW</em>, which
bore that dedication by the mid 12th century, <a href="#fnn836" name="anchorn836">(fn. 836)</a> 
is built of coursed rubble and ashlar and comprises chancel, nave with north aisle and south
porch, and west tower. The church was rebuilt
in the mid 13th century as a large building with
a long chancel and a nave and north aisle of six
bays. The aisle is a little earlier in style than the
chancel. <a href="#fnn837" name="anchorn837">(fn. 837)</a> The porch was added in the 14th
century and the upper part of the tower was
reconstructed in the 15th. Several of the windows were added in the 15th century, though
they were much restored in the 19th. The
church was restored in 1875 under F. S.
Waller at a cost of £2,500, all but £300 of
which was provided by Henry Crawshay of
Oaklands Park. The work included repewing
and refitting and the removal of plaster ceilings
from the nave and aisle, where the roofs were
reconstructed. <a href="#fnn838" name="anchorn838">(fn. 838)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p122"> </a>The octagonal font is probably of the early
15th century, <a href="#fnn839" name="anchorn839">(fn. 839)</a> and there is a 15th-century oak
rood screen, its lower part renewed. A niche
which survives over the south door once contained a statue of the Virgin Mary, which
attracted offerings in the 1350s. <a href="#fnn840" name="anchorn840">(fn. 840)</a> A massive,
roughly hewn dugout chest stands under the
tower. A ring of six bells was cast for the church
by Abraham Rudhall in 1712; the treble was
recast by Thomas Rudhall in 1775 and the
second and tenor by John Rudhall in 1821. <a href="#fnn841" name="anchorn841">(fn. 841)</a> The
plate includes a chalice and paten cover of 1576
and a tankard flagon of 1749 which was given to
the church in 1827. <a href="#fnn842" name="anchorn842">(fn. 842)</a> Much of the floor of the
church is still paved with the tombstones of the
numerous yeoman families of the parish, and the
churchyard has a large and varied collection of
carved headstones of the 18th century and the
early 19th. The registers survive from 1538. <a href="#fnn843" name="anchorn843">(fn. 843)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p123"> </a>At Blakeney the chapel of <em>ALL SAINTS</em>. so
called by 1750 but <em>c</em>. 1710 said to be dedicated
to SS. Philip and James, <a href="#fnn844" name="anchorn844">(fn. 844)</a> was recorded from
1551 when it was a chapel of ease to the parish
church. <a href="#fnn845" name="anchorn845">(fn. 845)</a> After 1657, when the Haberdashers'
Company endowed it with half the great tithes
of the parish, <a href="#fnn846" name="anchorn846">(fn. 846)</a> it came to be regarded as a
perpetual curacy, and curates, often called chaplains, were nominated by the Haberdashers. <a href="#fnn847" name="anchorn847">(fn. 847)</a> It
was not, however, assigned a particular area to
serve and was used by inhabitants of the whole
parish. The chapel was being used for marriages
by the 1680s and for baptisms by 1708 but did
not keep separate registers until 1813; <a href="#fnn848" name="anchorn848">(fn. 848)</a> a burial
ground was provided in 1892. <a href="#fnn849" name="anchorn849">(fn. 849)</a> The living was
worth £60 a year in 1750, most of the income
being supplied by the portion of the great
tithes. <a href="#fnn850" name="anchorn850">(fn. 850)</a> In 1856 it was worth £250. <a href="#fnn851" name="anchorn851">(fn. 851)</a> In 1853
the chapel was assigned a separate ecclesiastical
district, comprising the southern half of the
parish, <a href="#fnn852" name="anchorn852">(fn. 852)</a> and the living, later styled a vicarage,
continued in the gift of the Haberdashers. <a href="#fnn853" name="anchorn853">(fn. 853)</a> 
There was no glebe house until 1951. Moira
House, north-east of the chapel, was then acquired, <a href="#fnn854" name="anchorn854">(fn. 854)</a> and it served as the residence of the
vicars of the united benefice of Awre and Blakeney from 1952 to 1982.</p>
			<p><a name="p124"> </a>The curate of Blakeney from 1667 was Nicholas Billingsley, <a href="#fnn855" name="anchorn855">(fn. 855)</a> who had been deprived of the
living of Weobley (Herefs.) in 1662. His continuing lack of conformity attracted the hostility
of two successive vicars of Awre and of the
diocesan bishop, Robert Frampton, and he was
suspended before 1690. He later declined the
offer of Bishop Edward Fowler to reinstate him
and ministered to nonconformists at Blakeney
and elsewhere in the county. <a href="#fnn856" name="anchorn856">(fn. 856)</a> From 1693 to
1727 the curate was Richard Mantle <a href="#fnn857" name="anchorn857">(fn. 857)</a> who was
also rector of English Bicknor from 1710, <a href="#fnn858" name="anchorn858">(fn. 858)</a> and
from 1744 Roynon Jones, of the family which
owned the Nass estate, in Lydney, was curate. <a href="#fnn859" name="anchorn859">(fn. 859)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p125"> </a>In the early 18th century Blakeney chapel was
a small single-cell building with a gallery. <a href="#fnn860" name="anchorn860">(fn. 860)</a> It
was enlarged in 1748 when the nave was lengthened and a new aisle and chancel were added;
the cost was met by subscription. <a href="#fnn861" name="anchorn861">(fn. 861)</a> In 1799 the
gallery was rebuilt and a new one added. <a href="#fnn862" name="anchorn862">(fn. 862)</a> In
1820 the chapel was rebuilt to the designs of
Samuel Hewlett as a plain single-cell building
with a small west tower, a low south porch, and
large galleries. The new building was planned to
seat 700 and about a third of the cost was met
by the Crown <a href="#fnn863" name="anchorn863">(fn. 863)</a> because it was intended to serve
inhabitants of the adjoining part of the Forest.
Some internal refitting was carried out in 1880, <a href="#fnn864" name="anchorn864">(fn. 864)</a> 
and in 1906-7 the chapel was restored and a
small eastern apse added to the designs of
Prothero and Phillott of Cheltenham. <a href="#fnn865" name="anchorn865">(fn. 865)</a> The
bowl of the font is a 15th-century water stoup,
discovered near Gatcombe during building of
the South Wales railway. <a href="#fnn866" name="anchorn866">(fn. 866)</a> The single bell was
cast by Abraham Rudhall in 1719. <a href="#fnn867" name="anchorn867">(fn. 867)</a> The plate
includes a chalice of 1669, given to the chapel in
1766. <a href="#fnn868" name="anchorn868">(fn. 868)</a>

			<h3 id="h3-0009">NONCONFORMITY.</h3>
			<p><a name="p126"> </a>Nonconformity at
Blakeney apparently originated with Nicholas
Billingsley who was suspended as curate of the
Anglican chapel shortly before 1690. <a href="#fnn869" name="anchorn869">(fn. 869)</a> A group
led by him registered a house for dissenting
worship in the village in 1691 and other houses
there were registered the same year. <a href="#fnn870" name="anchorn870">(fn. 870)</a> In 1697
Billingsley performed the marriage of his son
Richard, described as a meeting teacher, in the
meeting house. <a href="#fnn871" name="anchorn871">(fn. 871)</a> The meeting at Blakeney,
styled Presbyterian, had 100 members <em>c</em>. 1715,
and its minister David Thomas <a href="#fnn872" name="anchorn872">(fn. 872)</a> registered his
house there for worship in 1727. <a href="#fnn873" name="anchorn873">(fn. 873)</a> In 1735 the
meeting was supported by funds from London;
the congregation was then described as very
small <a href="#fnn874" name="anchorn874">(fn. 874)</a> and it numbered only 12 in 1750. <a href="#fnn875" name="anchorn875">(fn. 875)</a> In
1773 the meeting was described as Presbyterian
or Congregationalist <a href="#fnn876" name="anchorn876">(fn. 876)</a> and it was presumably
represented later by the Congregationalist or
Independent cause at Blakeney.</p>
			<p><a name="p127"> </a>A group associated with William Bishop, minister of the Independent meeting at Gloucester,
registered a house at Blakeney in 1795. A prominent member was Richard Stiff, <a href="#fnn877" name="anchorn877">(fn. 877)</a> who had come
to the village in 1783 and was active in preaching
to nonconformists there and in the adjoining
part of the extraparochial Forest until his death
in 1816. <a href="#fnn878" name="anchorn878">(fn. 878)</a> In 1823 a small chapel called Blakeney
Tabernacle was built by the Revd. Isaac Bridgman just inside the parish boundary at Brain's
Green beside the road to Ayleford. Bridgman
was a former curate at Holy Trinity church,
Harrow Hill, in the Forest, who had found
difficulty in confining his views to established
church doctrine. <a href="#fnn879" name="anchorn879">(fn. 879)</a> Anglican liturgy was at first
used for the services, but in 1825 the congregation joined the Independents. Bridgman, who
remained minister until <em>c</em>. 1828, <a href="#fnn880" name="anchorn880">(fn. 880)</a> also registered
a house in Etloe in 1827. <a href="#fnn881" name="anchorn881">(fn. 881)</a> In 1849 the congregation left the Brain's Green chapel for a new
one, also called the Tabernacle, built in Blakeney
village on the Ayleford road. <a href="#fnn882" name="anchorn882">(fn. 882)</a> In 1851 the new
chapel, then styled Independent but later Congregational,
had average congregations of 265 in
the morning and 205 in the evening. <a href="#fnn883" name="anchorn883">(fn. 883)</a> In 1972,
when it became part of the new United Reformed Church, the church at Blakeney had 20
members and two lay preachers under a settled
minister who also served chapels in nearby
parishes. <a href="#fnn884" name="anchorn884">(fn. 884)</a> The chapel closed in 1988. <a href="#fnn885" name="anchorn885">(fn. 885)</a>

			<p><a name="p128"> </a>From 1818 a group of Baptists met at Blakeney
under the leadership of John Watkins of
Lydney. The group was attached to the Baptist
church at Coleford until 1821 when it became a
separate church. In 1833, when the membership
was <em>c</em>. 37, <a href="#fnn886" name="anchorn886">(fn. 886)</a> a chapel was built on the south side
of the main street. <a href="#fnn887" name="anchorn887">(fn. 887)</a> In 1851 it had average
congregations of 250 in the morning and 170 in
the evening. <a href="#fnn888" name="anchorn888">(fn. 888)</a> The chapel was restored in 1874. <a href="#fnn889" name="anchorn889">(fn. 889)</a> 
In 1989 the Baptist church had <em>c</em>. 25 members
under a minister. Shared services were then held
with the congregation of Blakeney's Anglican
church on two Sunday afternoons each month. <a href="#fnn890" name="anchorn890">(fn. 890)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p129"> </a>A small group of Wesleyan Methodists met in
a room at Blakeney from 1817, and <em>c</em>. 1832, when
there were <em>c</em>. 9 members, it was served by
travelling preachers or by the ministers of local
chapels. <a href="#fnn891" name="anchorn891">(fn. 891)</a> No later record of Wesleyans at Blakeney has been found.</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="h3-0010">EDUCATION.</h3>
			<p><a name="p130"> </a>Two schoolmasters were teaching at Blakeney in 1572 but one had failed to
obtain a licence from the diocesan authorities
and the other was declared contumacious and
suspended by them. <a href="#fnn892" name="anchorn892">(fn. 892)</a> Another schoolmaster was
teaching in the parish in 1605 <a href="#fnn893" name="anchorn893">(fn. 893)</a> and two were
recorded in 1623, one at Blakeney. <a href="#fnn894" name="anchorn894">(fn. 894)</a> Nicholas
Billingsley, curate of Blakeney, was teaching a
school in 1682, <a href="#fnn895" name="anchorn895">(fn. 895)</a> and the same year another man
was licensed to teach a private school in the
parish. <a href="#fnn896" name="anchorn896">(fn. 896)</a> Some of the masters recorded at Blakeney evidently held their school in the church
house which in 1683 was said to have been used
for that purpose from time immemorial. <a href="#fnn897" name="anchorn897">(fn. 897)</a> William Brown, described as a baker and
schoolmaster, died in 1750. <a href="#fnn898" name="anchorn898">(fn. 898)</a> In 1818 the only
school for the poor recorded in the parish was a
Sunday school attended by 120 children. <a href="#fnn899" name="anchorn899">(fn. 899)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p131"> </a>By 1833 there were two National schools in
the parish, said to have been started in 1830;
they were supported by subscriptions and pence
and taught a total of 133 children. One was
evidently at Blakeney <a href="#fnn900" name="anchorn900">(fn. 900)</a> and the other in Awre
village. Awre National school was provided with
a new building in 1855, built on part of the green
at the junction of the main village street and
Northington Lane; the site was given by the
lords of the manor, the Gloucester charity trustees, <a href="#fnn901" name="anchorn901">(fn. 901)</a> who in 1856 agreed to give £10 a year
towards running the school. <a href="#fnn902" name="anchorn902">(fn. 902)</a> In 1874 the income was mainly from voluntary contributions,
a shortfall being made up by the vicar. <a href="#fnn903" name="anchorn903">(fn. 903)</a> The
school had an average attendance in 1885 of only
36, <a href="#fnn904" name="anchorn904">(fn. 904)</a> and in 1910, as Awre C. of E. school, of
only 34. The average attendance was down to
24 by 1922 and the school closed in 1927. <a href="#fnn905" name="anchorn905">(fn. 905)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p132"> </a>Blakeney National school was evidently one of
the schools said to have opened in 1830, though
it was later said to have been built in 1827 and
enlarged in 1831, <a href="#fnn906" name="anchorn906">(fn. 906)</a> in which year the building,
north of Blakeney chapel at the entrance to
Lowfield Lane, was secured by a trust deed. <a href="#fnn907" name="anchorn907">(fn. 907)</a> It
was again recorded in 1856, <a href="#fnn908" name="anchorn908">(fn. 908)</a> and in 1827 it was
teaching <em>c</em>. 90 children and was supported
mainly by voluntary contributions and pence. <a href="#fnn909" name="anchorn909">(fn. 909)</a> 
In 1873 the old building was replaced by a new
school, built beside the main Gloucester road
above the village on a piece of rectory glebe land
leased by the Haberdashers' Company to the
vicar of Blakeney. In 1885 it had an average
attendance of 80, <a href="#fnn910" name="anchorn910">(fn. 910)</a> and in 1910, as Blakeney C.
of E. school, it had accommodation for 176 and
an average attendance of 98 in mixed and infants' departments. The average atendance fell
to 51 by 1922 and to 32 by 1932, and the school
was closed in 1935. <a href="#fnn911" name="anchorn911">(fn. 911)</a> The building was a private
house in 1989.</p>
			<p><a name="p133"> </a>By 1852 there was also a British school at
Blakeney <a href="#fnn912" name="anchorn912">(fn. 912)</a> but it was apparently re-established
and placed under a new management committee
in 1865. In 1865 it had an attendance of 60 and
was supported mainly by pence, the children
paying 2<em>d</em>., 3<em>d</em>., or 4<em>d</em>. a week depending on the
number of subjects they studied. <a href="#fnn913" name="anchorn913">(fn. 913)</a> The school,
on the south side of Bridge Street near the west
end of the village, was rebuilt in 1873. In 1885
the average attendance was 70 <a href="#fnn914" name="anchorn914">(fn. 914)</a> and in 1904 it
had an average attendance of 129 in mixed and
infants' departments. <a href="#fnn915" name="anchorn915">(fn. 915)</a> The school was renamed
Blakeney Council school in 1905 when it was
transferred to the county council, and the building was enlarged during 1907 and 1908 to
accommodate the children from Blakeney
Woodside C. of E. school, at Blakeney Hill. <a href="#fnn916" name="anchorn916">(fn. 916)</a> 
The average attendance was 197 in 1910 <a href="#fnn917" name="anchorn917">(fn. 917)</a> and
rose to 250 by 1922. The school was enlarged to
accommodate 380 before 1932 but in 1938 the
average attendance was 232. <a href="#fnn918" name="anchorn918">(fn. 918)</a> In 1989, as Blakeney County Primary school, it had 101 children
on its roll. <a href="#fnn919" name="anchorn919">(fn. 919)</a>

			<h3 id="h3-0011">CHARITIES FOR THE POOR.</h3>
			<p><a name="p134"> </a>Richard Hart
of Gurshill, Lydney, by will dated 1665 gave
£15 to the poor of Awre parish. <a href="#fnn920" name="anchorn920">(fn. 920)</a> The principal
with other funds was used in 1707 to buy back
the church house at Blakeney, which had been
taken from the parish. Later the rent of the
house, which was £4 14<em>s</em>. 6<em>d. c</em>. 1780, was
distributed to the poor. <a href="#fnn921" name="anchorn921">(fn. 921)</a> After the house was
demolished in 1819 £5 was paid out of the
church rates instead. About 1825 it was intended
to replace the £15 principal <a href="#fnn922" name="anchorn922">(fn. 922)</a> but the charity had
been lost by 1865. <a href="#fnn923" name="anchorn923">(fn. 923)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p135"> </a>James Stokes by will dated 1745 gave three
bushels of wheat, to be delivered at Blakeney
chapel by the tenant of Little Box farm and
distributed among the poor of Blakeney and
Etloe tithings. <a href="#fnn924" name="anchorn924">(fn. 924)</a> In 1913 the Crown as owner of
the farm gave £30 stock to replace the bequest. <a href="#fnn925" name="anchorn925">(fn. 925)</a> 
Thomas Terret by will of 1771 gave £10, the
interest to be distributed to the poor of the same
two tithings, <a href="#fnn926" name="anchorn926">(fn. 926)</a> and Matthew A Deane of Etloe
House by will dated 1791 gave £20, the proceeds
to be distributed in bread at Blakeney chapel
among the poor of Blakeney, Etloe, and Etloe
Duchy tithings. <a href="#fnn927" name="anchorn927">(fn. 927)</a> The sums given by Terret and
A Deane were lent out together on security <a href="#fnn928" name="anchorn928">(fn. 928)</a> and
had been lost by 1865. <a href="#fnn929" name="anchorn929">(fn. 929)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p136"> </a>In 1825 the vicar Charles Sandiford bought the
Bird in Hand inn, at Blakeney, for £280 and
settled it on trustees; they were to use the rent,
initially £18 a year, to maintain the church clock,
pay the clerk £3 a year for winding it, and buy
flannel and blankets for the poor. The inn was
sold <em>c</em>. 1863 and the proceeds, apparently <em>c</em>.
£400, were invested in stock. <a href="#fnn930" name="anchorn930">(fn. 930)</a> John Blanch of
Etloe House by will dated 1824 left £100, the
proceeds to be distributed among the poor. <a href="#fnn931" name="anchorn931">(fn. 931)</a> A
Scheme of 1918 amalgamated the eleemosynary
part of the Sandiford charity with the Blanch
charity, authorizing a distribution in flannel and
blankets or sums of up to £2 10<em>s</em>. to meet
particular cases of need. <a href="#fnn932" name="anchorn932">(fn. 932)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p137"> </a>Harriet Barber by will proved 1883 left £1,000
for the poor. Frederick Barber by will proved
1887 gave £50, the income to be distributed in
bread. <a href="#fnn933" name="anchorn933">(fn. 933)</a> Mrs. E. B. Wait in 1902 left £150, the
income to be distributed in sheets, flannel, and
serge petticoats to the poor of Awre, excluding
inhabitants of Blakeney ecclesiastical parish; <a href="#fnn934" name="anchorn934">(fn. 934)</a> 
the charity was apparently implemented but
lapsed some time after 1919. <a href="#fnn935" name="anchorn935">(fn. 935)</a> Mary Teesdale by
will proved 1924 left a sum for the poor of
Blakeney, <a href="#fnn936" name="anchorn936">(fn. 936)</a> and Edward Bennett by will proved
1946 left a bequest, represented in 1948 by £700
stock, the income to be used to pay 10<em>s</em>. each to
30 aged inhabitants of Blakeney ecclesiastical
parish. <a href="#fnn937" name="anchorn937">(fn. 937)</a> 
			</p>
			<p><a name="p138"> </a>A Scheme of 1972 formed the Stokes, Teesdale, and Bennett charities into the Blakeney
United Charities for the relief of old people of
Blakeney ecclesiastical parish in cash or kind. A
Scheme of 1974 amalgamated the eleemosynary
Sandiford charity and the Blanch, Frederick
Barber, and Harriet Barber charities and applied
the income to the relief of cases of need in the
whole of the ancient parish. <a href="#fnn938" name="anchorn938">(fn. 938)</a>

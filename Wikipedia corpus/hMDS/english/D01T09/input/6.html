http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/980634 and from there runs parallel to the coast,
through the Glaven estuary behind the sand and shingle spit known as Blakeney Spit, before it
discharges into the sea at Blakeney Point. Flood defence embankments run adjacent to the
channel, which prevents the tidal flooding of adjacent fresh water marshes at Blakeney
Freshes and at Cley and Salthouse. Because of the impeding danger of the former channel of the
River Glaven being blocked by natural southwards migration of Blakeney Spit, and more
recently also because of shingle that had become displaced following storms in 1993 and in
1996, resulting in flooding of the adjacent Blakeney Freshes Special Protection Area and the
village of Cley, the Environment Agency decided to cut a new channel to the south of the old one &gt;
http://www.geograph.org.uk/submit.php. Before the cutting of a new channel to realign the
course of the River Glaven through the Blakeney Freshes, an archaeological survey was
carried out in 2003 - 05 in order to excavate and record what remained of the so-called Blakeney
Chapel, an ancient scheduled monument located on a low natural rise within a cattle pasture by
Blakeney Spit. Cartographic evidence suggests that a structure has existed at this site from
at least 1586; archaeological investigation indicated human activity in the area since
neolithic times but it could not be established what purpose the building served - historical
evidence for any religious dedication could be not found. The walls of the building were
partly re-buried but the ground-plan of the structure was left clearly visible for public
inspection for as long as the monument would survive - only a few years later no traces remain.

discharges into the sea at Blakeney Point. Flood defence embankments run adjacent to the
channel, which prevents the tidal flooding of adjacent fresh water marshes at Blakeney
Freshes and at Cley and Salthouse. Because of the impeding danger of the former channel of the
River Glaven being blocked by natural southwards migration of Blakeney Spit, and more
recently also because of shingle that had become displaced following storms in 1993 and in
1996, resulting in flooding of the adjacent Blakeney Freshes Special Protection Area and the

course of the River Glaven through the Blakeney Freshes, an archaeological survey was
carried out in 2003 - 05 in order to excavate and record what remained of the so-called Blakeney
Chapel, an ancient scheduled monument located on a low natural rise within a cattle pasture by
Blakeney Spit. Cartographic evidence suggests that a structure has existed at this site from
at least 1586; archaeological investigation indicated human activity in the area since
neolithic times but it could not be established what purpose the building served - historical
evidence for any religious dedication could be not found. The walls of the building were
partly re-buried but the ground-plan of the structure was left clearly visible for public
inspection for as long as the monument would survive - only a few years later no traces remain.

carried out in 2003 - 05 in order to excavate and record what remained of the so-called Blakeney
Chapel, an ancient scheduled monument located on a low natural rise within a cattle pasture by
Blakeney Spit. Cartographic evidence suggests that a structure has existed at this site from
at least 1586; archaeological investigation indicated human activity in the area since
neolithic times but it could not be established what purpose the building served - historical
evidence for any religious dedication could be not found. The walls of the building were
partly re-buried but the ground-plan of the structure was left clearly visible for public
inspection for as long as the monument would survive - only a few years later no traces remain.

course of the River Glaven through the Blakeney Freshes, an archaeological survey was
carried out in 2003 - 05 in order to excavate and record what remained of the so-called Blakeney
Chapel, an ancient scheduled monument located on a low natural rise within a cattle pasture by
Blakeney Spit. Cartographic evidence suggests that a structure has existed at this site from
at least 1586; archaeological investigation indicated human activity in the area since
neolithic times but it could not be established what purpose the building served - historical
evidence for any religious dedication could be not found. The walls of the building were
partly re-buried but the ground-plan of the structure was left clearly visible for public
inspection for as long as the monument would survive - only a few years later no traces remain.

the south of the old one &gt; http://www.geograph.org.uk/submit.php. Before the cutting of a
new channel to realign the course of the River Glaven through the Blakeney Freshes, an
archaeological survey was carried out in 2003 - 05 in order to excavate and record what
remained of the so-called Blakeney Chapel, an ancient scheduled monument located on a low
natural rise within a cattle pasture by Blakeney Spit. Cartographic evidence suggests that a
structure has existed at this site from at least 1586; archaeological investigation
indicated human activity in the area since neolithic times but it could not be established
what purpose the building served - historical evidence for any religious dedication could be
not found. The walls of the building were partly re-buried but the ground-plan of the
structure was left clearly visible for public inspection for as long as the monument would
survive - only a few years later no traces remain.

The tidal River Glaven extends from the sluices on the A149 coast road >\n/web/20160406212756/http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/980634 and from there runs parallel to the coast,\nthrough the Glaven estuary behind the sand and shingle spit known as Blakeney Spit, before it\ndischarges into the sea at Blakeney Point. Flood defence embankments run adjacent to the\nchannel, which prevents the tidal flooding of adjacent fresh water marshes at Blakeney\nFreshes and at Cley and Salthouse. Because of the impeding danger of the former channel of the\nRiver Glaven being blocked by natural southwards migration of Blakeney Spit, and more\nrecently also because of shingle that had become displaced following storms in 1993 and in\n1996, resulting in flooding of the adjacent Blakeney Freshes Special Protection Area and the\nvillage of Cley, the Environment Agency decided to cut a new channel to the south of the old one >\n/web/20160406212756/http://www.geograph.org.uk/submit.php. Before the cutting of a new channel to realign the\ncourse of the River Glaven through the Blakeney Freshes, an archaeological survey was\ncarried out in 2003 - 05 in order to excavate and record what remained of the so-called Blakeney\nChapel, an ancient scheduled monument located on a low natural rise within a cattle pasture by\nBlakeney Spit. Cartographic evidence suggests that a structure has existed at this site from\nat least 1586; archaeological investigation indicated human activity in the area since\nneolithic times but it could not be established what purpose the building served - historical\nevidence for any religious dedication could be not found. The walls of the building were\npartly re-buried but the ground-plan of the structure was left clearly visible for public\ninspection for as long as the monument would survive - only a few years later no traces remain.\n/web/20160406212756/http://www.helm.org.uk/server/show/ConCaseStudy.97", "locationItem": {"view_url": "/v/W/File%3AThe%20site%20of%20Blakeney%20Chapel%20-%20geograph.org.uk%20-%20980743.jpg/-/en", "author_name": "Evelyn Simak", "source_url": "/web/20160406212756/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The site of Blakeney Chapel -

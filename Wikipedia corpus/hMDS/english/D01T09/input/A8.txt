Norfolk has a long history of human occupation dating back to the Palaeolithic, and has produced significant archaeological finds.
Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards.
The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the very cold conditions that existed then, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present.
As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea.
This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland.

Early Mesolithic flint tools with characteristic long blades up to 15cmMurphy (2009) p. 14.
long found on the present-day coast at Titchwell Marsh date from a time when it was 60 – 70km from the sea.
Other flint tools have been found dating from the Upper Paleolithic (50,000–10,000 BCE) to the Neolithic (5,000–2,500 BCE).
An "eye" is an area of higher ground in the marshes, dry enough to support buildings.
Blakeney's former Carmelite friary, founded in 1296 and dissolved in 1538, was built in such a location,Robertson et al. (2005) p. 36.
and several fragments of plain roof tile and pantiles dating back to the 13th century have been found near the site of its ruins.Robertson et al. (2005) p. 143.
Originally on the south side of the Glaven, Blakeney Eye had a ditched enclosure during the 11th and 12th centuries, and a building known as " Blakeney Chapel ", which was occupied from the 14th century to around 1600, and again in the late 17th century.
Despite its name, it is unlikely that it had a religious function.
Nearly a third of the mostly 14th- to 16th-century pottery found within the larger and earlier of the two rooms was imported from the continent,Birks (2003) pp. 1–28.

The spit sheltered the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, which were important medieval harbours.
Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, and between the 14th and 16th centuries it was the only Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials.
Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church.
It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, Retrieved 10 September 2011.
perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built wooden ship.
Land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 just to the west of Cley, led to the silting up of the Glaven shipping channel and relocation of Cley's wharf.
Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley.
In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost.Pevsner & Wilson (2002) p. 435.
The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply.Hume, Joseph.
" Port of Cley and Blakeney " in appendix to Blakeney's shipping trade benefited from the silting up of its nearby rival, and in 1817 the channel to the Haven was deepened to improve access.
Packet ships ran to Hull and London from 1840, but this trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour.

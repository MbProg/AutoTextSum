and Marc McGeorge Jena 6 On December 4th, 2006, Justin Barker, a white student at Jena High School was assaulted by six fellow African American Students The events leading up to the assault of Barker included the hanging of nooses from a tree in the high school courtyard,two violent confrontations between black and white youths, and the destruction by fire to the main building of Jena High School From left-right: Theo Shaw, Mychal Bell, Robert Bailey Jr., Jesse Beard, Carwin Jones and Bryant Purvis. Mychal Bell was tried as an adult due to his criminal record and because he was believed to initiate the attack
The rest of the Jena Six did not get tried as an adult even though Carwin Jones was 18 at the time
The Jena six were charged with attempted murder Six individuals, Robert Bailey, 17; Mychal Bell, 16; Carwin Jones, 18; Bryant Purvis, 17; Jesse Ray Beard, 14; and Theo Shaw, 17 were arrested in the assault on Barker. All of the Jena six's charges were reduced to aggravated 2nd degree battery and conspiracy
Since this charge requires the use of a weapon, the judge decided to use Bell's tennis shoe as the main weapon
After many pleas for bell not to be tried as an adult, the judge decided to drop the adult charges of Bell and charge his as a jeuvenille. Bell pled guilty to a reduced charge of battery and was sentenced to 18 months in Juvenile prison
The remaining five defendants entered pleas of no contest to a charge of simple battery. The court found them guilty as charged, and sentenced each to a fine of 500 dollars to be paid as court costs, restitution to be paid to the Barker family, and seven days of unsupervised probation Rallies for the release of the Jena 6 sprouted across the United states
The most notable rally occured on the day of Mychal Bell's trial in the town of Jena. The rally consisted of 10,000-15,000 people.
People from across the nation came to the Jena rally.
Notable names in the rally are Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King III, Al Sharpton, and rapper Ice-cube
The Jena 6 movement was considered the first struggle for the Civil Rights Movement in the 21st century http://fallingpanda.blogspot.com/2009/08/jena-6-where-are-they-

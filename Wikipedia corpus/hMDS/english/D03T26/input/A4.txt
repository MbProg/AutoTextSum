My Story as a Jena 6
KNOE 8 News - Before the Trayvon Martin rallies, Ferguson's unrest, or the Chicago protest, there was the March for Justice in Jena Louisiana.
The Jena 6 were black teenagers convicted in the 2006 beating of Justin Barker , a white student who also attended Jena High School.
The attack and attempted 2nd degree murder charges filed against the six boys divided the City of Jena.
Bryant Purvis was just 17-years-old when he was convicted, not 10 years later Purvis has since graduated from Grambling State University, moved to Dallas; obtained a law degree and authored a book titled "My story as  a Jena 6."
Bryant Purvis joined us in studio to talk about his life since the incident nearly 10 years ago and what he has learned since then.

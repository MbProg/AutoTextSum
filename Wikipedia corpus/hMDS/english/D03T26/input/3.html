<b>Summary of the &quot;Jena Six&quot; Case<br />By Discover The Networks<br />2007</b><br /><br />Jena, Louisiana is a mostly white town of approximately 3,000 people. On  August 30, 2006,&nbsp;Jena's local high school held a back-to-school  assembly for its male students only, where the boys were briefed on such  matters as basic school rules and dress codes. At one point in the  proceedings, an African American student jokingly asked whether blacks  were permitted to sit with whites under one particular shade tree on  campus. His fellow students laughed heartily, and the assistant  principal who was running the assembly answered that, of course, there  were no restrictions on where anyone could sit. Numerous other questions  were asked as well, and the assembly was entirely free of rancor.<br /> <br /> The next day, the first few students to arrive at Jena High School found  three (some reports said there were only two) nylon-rope nooses hanging  from the tree that had been referenced by the black questioner during  the assembly. Administrators immediately removed the nooses from the  tree, and the vast majority of the students never saw them. But the  story nonetheless found its way into the media. It became big news in  television and newspaper reports, &ldquo;evoking for some,&rdquo; <a href="/web/20160418095904/http://cbs2.com/topstories/topstories_story_262100544.html">as CBS News put it</a>, &ldquo;the image of lynchings in the old South.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> Before long,&nbsp;Jena High&nbsp;administrators learned that three white students  had hung the nooses as a &ldquo;prank&rdquo; which had no racial motivation. The  local police and FBI agents interviewed the boys responsible, and  likewise concluded that race had nothing to do with the incident. As  Charlotte Allen <a href="/web/20160418095904/http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/589bfhgz.asp">reports</a> in <i>The Weekly Standard</i>,  &ldquo;The three students maintained that the nooses were a school  spirit-prompted prank directed at a rival school's Western-themed  football team (the youths said they were inspired by a hanging in the  1980s television miniseries <i>Lonesome Dove</i>).&rdquo;<br /> <br /> Still, Jena High administrators were disturbed by the perception that  the boys' actions may have been racially based. As a result, the  three&nbsp;perpetrators were forced to attend an alternative school for one  month, after which they&nbsp;served a&nbsp;two-week suspension from their regular  school.<br /> <br /> The noose incident was followed at Jena High by a couple of on-campus  interracial confrontations over the next few days -- a heated argument  between two girls, and a fight in which a white boy suffered a head  wound that required stitches.&nbsp;These were unusual events at a school with  no history of racial conflict. From September 9 through November 30,  there were no further racial incidents either at the high school or in  the town of Jena. Then, on the night of November 30, the main  high-school building was set on fire and was badly damaged. No  perpetrator was ever found, and the motive was unknown.<br /> <br /> After the fire, the school was closed for a few days, during which time  two racial incidents occurred in the town of Jena. At a December 1  private party (attended by mostly whites as well as a few blacks) at a  social hall known as the &ldquo;Fair Barn&rdquo; a fight erupted when five black  Jena High students tried to crash the event. The next day at a  convenience store, there was a fight between three black students and a  white man.<br /> <br /> When the school reopened on December 4, football player Mychal Bell led a  gang of eight to ten fellow black students in pummeling a white  11th-grader named Justin Barker. (It should be noted that Barker&nbsp;had had  nothing to do with either the&nbsp;August 31 noose affair or&nbsp;the  aforementioned fights of December 1 and 2.) The assailants beat Barker  into unconsciousness in what the <i>Jena Times</i> called &ldquo;one of the  most violent attacks in Jena High School&rsquo;s history.&rdquo; Witnesses would  later report that Barker&rsquo;s attackers had &ldquo;stomped him badly,&rdquo; &ldquo;stepped  on his face&rdquo; while he was &ldquo;knocked out cold on the ground,&rdquo; and &ldquo;slammed  his head on the concrete beam.&rdquo; The media promoted the notion that the  attack may have been provoked by the noose incident. Yet not only did  Barker have nothing to do with that incident, but it had occurred more  than three months earlier.<br /> <br /> After his beating, Barker was taken by ambulance to LaSalle General  Hospital where he spent some two and a half hours in the emergency room  before being released. Later that night a swollen-faced Barker  attended&nbsp;his school&rsquo;s annual class ring ceremony; he left early, as soon  as he had received his ring. He&nbsp;would later&nbsp;report that as a result of  the injuries he had suffered on December 4, he experienced blindness in  one eye for three weeks and was still plagued by headaches six months  after the beating.<br /> <br /> Six of Barker&rsquo;s black assailants were originally charged with attempted  second-degree murder. (These were the individuals who became known  collectively as the Jena Six.) Mychal Bell, who was 16 years old at the  time of the attack, was charged as an adult because he already had been  on probation since being convicted of a December 2005 battery; moreover,  he also had been convicted of two subsequent violent crimes and a  property crime prior to his assault against Barker.<br /> <br /> Just before Bell&rsquo;s trial in the summer of 2007, LaSalle Parish District  Attorney Reed Walters scaled back the attempted murder charges against  all the youths to aggravated battery and conspiracy. But the original  set of very serious charges continued to draw criticism from civil  rights and civil liberties activists who complained that blacks in the  criminal-justice system were routinely treated more harshly than whites.  &ldquo;Local civil rights groups objected to what they saw as a throwback to  the worst kind of Deep South justice,&rdquo; reported CBS News, &ldquo;and that  protest has escalated into a nationwide campaign.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> On June 28, an all-white jury of five women and one man pronounced Bell  guilty. It should be noted that when the jury members for the case were  selected, none of the blacks who had been summoned actually appeared at  the courthouse. As a result, the pool of potential jurors consisted of  whites only.<br /> <br /> On August 5, Al Sharpton&nbsp;went to Jena and declared: &ldquo;You cannot have  some [white] boys assault and charged with nothing, some [white] boys  hanging nooses and finish the school year, and other [black] boys  charged with attempted murder and conspiracy. That&rsquo;s two levels of  justice, and two levels of justice is an injustice.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> On September 10, Jesse Jackson&nbsp;went to Jena and threatened&nbsp;to organize a  &ldquo;major demonstration&rdquo; of perhaps 40,000 angry protesters unless Bell&rsquo;s  sentence was thrown out and the charges against the remaining attackers  were reduced to misdemeanors. Four days after Jackson&rsquo;s threat, Judicial  District Court Judge J.P. Mauffray Jr. vacated Bell&rsquo;s adult conviction  and ordered that he be retried as a juvenile.<br /> <br /> Nonetheless on September 20, 2007, tens of thousands of&nbsp;(mostly black)  demonstrators from all over the United States&nbsp;descended on&nbsp;Jena to  protest the allegedly unfair legal treatment of the six black  assailants.&nbsp;Key organizers of the demonstration included <a href="/web/20160418095904/http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=1527">Al Sharpton</a> and <a href="/web/20160418095904/http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=687">Jesse Jackson</a>.  Comparing the case to seminal civil-rights moments like the Montgomery  bus boycott of 1955, Jackson said: &ldquo;In Jena, for those who have been  under the illusion that changes have occurred, this is a wake-up call.<br /> <br /> According to a September 2007 <a href="/web/20160418095904/http://www.aclu.org/racialjustice/edu/31801prs20070914.html">statement</a> by the&nbsp;<a href="/web/20160418095904/http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6145">American Civil Liberties Union</a>,  &ldquo;the Jena Six case raises serious questions about a possible double  standard for whites and blacks in the criminal justice system -- and in  our schools.&rdquo; &ldquo;Possible differences in treatment between students of  different races, the apparent overcharging of students by law  enforcement and questions about the possibility of discrimination  generally in the school are emblematic of the &lsquo;school-to-prison  pipeline&rsquo; cases that we are seeing nationwide,&rdquo; <a href="/web/20160418095904/http://www.aclu.org/racialjustice/edu/31801prs20070914.html">lamented</a> Dennis Parker, Director of the ACLU&rsquo;s Racial Justice Project.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;I think a lot of people recognize that the criminal-justice system  grinds down people of color every day,&rdquo; said J. Richard Cohen, President  of the <a href="/web/20160418095904/http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6989">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>.  &ldquo;Oftentimes, it&rsquo;s nameless, it&rsquo;s faceless. We know the story in a  generic way but not specifically. People see Jena as the tip of the  iceberg and ask, &lsquo;What lies beneath?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /> <br /> The <a href="/web/20160418095904/http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6160">NAACP</a> likewise expressed its belief that justice&nbsp;was a rare commodity for black Americans in the court system.<br /> <br /> In January 2008, journalist Charlotte Allen <a href="/web/20160418095904/http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/589bfhgz.asp">reported</a>  the following: &ldquo;&hellip; Mychal Bell appeared with his team of lawyers at the  parish courthouse in this tiny Central Louisiana town of 3,000 on  December 3 [2007] and pled guilty to second-degree battery, to  intentionally inflicting serious bodily injury on another person.

Jena Six: Waiting for Justice
Release date: October 29,                         2007
Issues of injustice, racism, and inequality relating to the Jena Six and other such polarizing incidents will be addressed at a panel discussion on Monday, October 29, from 6 to 8 p.m. in Goucher College’s Haebler Memorial Chapel.
This event is free and open to the public, and refreshments will be served.
This gathering is not meant to serve as an information session on what happened to the students of Jena, rather it will be an opportunity for students, faculty, staff, and the greater community to ask questions about the political and social injustices surrounding the incident and how a peaceable outcome might be reached.
Panelists will be:
• Dr. Nsenga Burton – Multi-media producer and professor of communications at Goucher College
• Dr. Kelly Brown Douglas – Chair and professor of religion and philosophy at Goucher College
•  Russell Neverdon – Attorney
• Sanford J. Ungar – President of Goucher College and former director of Voice of America
• Romaine Williams – Minister and attorney
The Jena Six refers to a group of six black teenagers who have been charged with the beating of Justin Barker, a white teenager at Jena High School in Jena, LA, on December 4, 2006. The beating followed a number of racially charged incidents in the town. The case has sparked protests — in Jena and elsewhere — by those who believe the arrests and the subsequent charges were excessive and racially discriminatory.

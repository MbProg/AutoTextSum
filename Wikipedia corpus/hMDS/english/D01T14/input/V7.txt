Boydell Shakespeare Gallery - Illustrated Shakespeare Edition and Folio
Illustrated Shakespeare Edition and Folio
See also: Shakespeare's editors
The "magnificent and accurate" Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was to be the focus of his enterprise—he viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project.
In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition , Nicol wrote that "splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition".
The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes.
Each play had its own title page followed by a list of "Persons in the Drama".
Boydell spared no expense.
He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition.
Nicol explains in the preface that they "established a printing-house ... a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink".
Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove Whatman paper.
The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired.
The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805.
Boydell was responsible for the "splendor", and George Steevens, the general editor, was responsible for the "correctness of text ".
Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was "at first an ardent advocate of the plan" but "soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers ".
He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he said nothing to jeopardize the edition's sales.
Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint.
Wenner describes the resulting hybrid edition:
The thirty-six plays, printed from the texts of Reed and Malone, divide into the following three groups: (1) five plays of the first three numbers printed from Reed's edition of 1785 with many changes adopted from the Malone text of 1790 (2) King Lear and the six plays of the next three numbers printed from Malone's edition of 1790 but exhibiting conspicuous deviations from his basic text (3) twenty-four plays of the last twelve numbers also printed from Malone's text but made to conform to Steevens's own edition of 1793.
Throughout the edition, modern (i.e. 18th-century) spelling was preferred as were First Folio readings.
Boydell sought out the most eminent painters and engravers of the day to contribute paintings for the gallery, engravings for the folio , and illustrations for the edition.
Artists included Richard Westall, Thomas Stothard, George Romney, Henry Fuseli, Benjamin West, Angelica Kauffmann, Robert Smirke, John Opie, Francesco Bartolozzi, Thomas Kirk, Henry Thomson, and Boydell's nephew and business partner, Josiah Boydell .
The folio and the illustrated Shakespeare edition were "by far the largest single engraving enterprise ever undertaken in England".
As print collector and dealer Christopher Lennox-Boyd explains, "had there not been a market for such engravings, not one of the paintings would have been commissioned, and few, if any, of the artists would have risked painting such elaborate compositions".
Scholars believe that a variety of engraving methods were employed and that line engraving was the "preferred medium" because it was "clear and hardwearing" and because it had a high reputation.
Stipple engraving, which was quicker and often used to produce shading effects, wore out quicker and was valued less.
Many plates were a mixture of both.
Several scholars have suggested that mezzotint and aquatint were also used.
Lennox-Boyd, however, claims that "close examination of the plates confirms" that these two methods were not used and argues that they were "totally unsuitable": mezzotint wore quickly and aquatint was too new (there would not have been enough artists capable of executing it).
Most of Boydell's engravers were also trained artists ; for example, Bartolozzi was renowned for his stippling technique.
Boydell's relationships with his illustrators were generally congenial.
One of them, James Northcote, praised Boydell's liberal payments.
He wrote in an 1821 letter that Boydell "did more for the advancement of the arts in England than the whole mass of the nobility put together!
He paid me more nobly than any other person has done; and his memory I shall ever hold in reverence".
Boydell typically paid the painters between £105 to £210, and the engravers between £262 and £315.
Joshua Reynolds at first declined Boydell's offer to work on the project, but he agreed when pressed.
Boydell offered Reynolds carte blanche for his paintings , giving him a down payment of £500, an extraordinary amount for an artist who had not even agreed to do a specific work.
Boydell eventually paid him a total of £1,500.
There are 96 illustrations in the nine volumes of the illustrated edition and each play has at least one.
Approximately two-thirds of the plays, 23 out of 36, are each illustrated by a single artist.
Approximately two-thirds of the total number of illustrations , or 65, were completed by three artists: William Hamilton, Richard Westall, and Robert Smirke.
The primary illustrators of the edition were known as book illustrators, whereas a majority of the artists included in the folio were known for their paintings.
Lennox-Boyd argues that the illustrations in the edition have a "uniformity and cohesiveness" that the folio lacks because the artists and engravers working on them understood book illustration while those working on the folio were working in an unfamiliar medium.
The print folio, A Collection of Prints, From Pictures Painted for the Purpose of Illustrating the Dramatic Works of Shakspeare, by the Artists of Great-Britain (1805), was originally intended to be a collection of the illustrations from the edition, but a few years into the project, Boydell altered his plan.
He guessed that he could sell more folios and editions if the pictures were different.
Of the 97 prints made from paintings, two-thirds of them were made by ten of the artists.
Three artists account for one-third of the paintings.
In all, 31 artists contributed works.

Famous quotes containing the words edition, illustrated and/or shakespeare:
“I knew a gentleman who was so good a manager of his time that he would not even lose that small portion of it which the calls of nature obliged him to pass in the necessary-house, but gradually went through all the Latin poets in those moments.
He bought, for example, a common edition of Horace, of which he tore off gradually a couple of pages, read them first, and then sent them down as a sacrifice to Cloacina: this was so much time fairly gained.”
— Philip Dormer Stanhope , 4th Earl Chesterfield (16941773)
“The barriers of conventionality have been raised so high, and so strangely cemented by long existence, that the only hope of overthrowing them exists in the union of numbers linked together by common opinion and effort ... the united watchword of thousands would strike at the foundation of the false system and annihilate it.”
— Mme. Ellen Louise Demorest 18241898 , U.S. womens magazine editor and womans club movement pioneer.
Demorests Illustrated Monthly and Mirror of Fashions, p. 203 (January 1870)
“Come on, poor babe,
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses.
Wolves and bears, they say,
Casting their savageness aside, have done
Like offices of pity.”
—William Shakespeare (15641616)

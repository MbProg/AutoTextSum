Boydell Shakespeare Gallery

Jump to: navigation , search
The Boydell Shakespeare Gallery was a collection of pictures commissioned by 18th-century engraver and publisher John Boydell in an effort to foster a school of British history painting. The project contained three parts: an illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays, a folio of prints from the gallery, and a public gallery where the original paintings for the prints hung. The project was conceived at a dinner in November 1786, the gallery opened in May 1788, and the entire contents were sold and dispersed in 1805.
This Wikimedia Commons gallery collects images of the paintings, engravings, and sculptures generated by Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery.
The lists of art works are taken from Winifred H. Friedman's Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery.
Note: at this point, many images are merely listed, rather than displayed in gallery format.

Thomas Banks's sculptural group was originally placed above the entrance to the Shakespeare Gallery in 1789. Despite plans to use it as a monument for John Boydell's tomb after his death in 1804, it remained on the building's façade until its demolition in 1868–69. It was then transported to Stratford-upon-Avon and re-erected in New Place Garden in 1870.
Paintings[ edit ]
Engravings were made from the paintings for either the folio, the illustrated edition, or sometimes both. The order of the plays used here is that from the Illustrated Edition.

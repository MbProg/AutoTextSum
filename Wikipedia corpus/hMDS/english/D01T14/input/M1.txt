Boydell Shakespeare Gallery
The Boydell Shakespeare Gallery was a collection of pictures commissioned by 18th-century engraver and publisher John Boydell in an effort to foster a school of British history painting.
The project contained three parts: an illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays, a folio of prints from the gallery, and a public gallery where the original paintings for the prints hung.
The project was conceived at a dinner in November 1786, the gallery opened in May 1788, and the entire contents were sold and dispersed in 1805.
This Wikimedia Commons gallery collects images of the paintings, engravings, and sculptures generated by Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery.
The lists of art works are taken from Winifred H. Friedman's Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery.
Note: at this point, many images are merely listed, rather than displayed in gallery format.

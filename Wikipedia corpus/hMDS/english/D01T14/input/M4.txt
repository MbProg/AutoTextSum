John Boydell - Shakespeare Venture
Shakespeare Venture
Boydellâ€™s crowning achievement was his Shakespeare project, which was to occupy much of the last two decades of his life.
The project contained three parts: an illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays, a public gallery of paintings depicting scenes from the plays, and a folio of prints based on the paintings.
The idea of a grand Shakespeare edition was conceived at a dinner at Josiah Boydellâ€™s home in November 1786.
The guest list itself is evidence of Boydellâ€™s extensive connections in the artistic world: Benjamin West, painter to King George III; George Romney, a renowned painter; George Nicol, bookseller to the king and painter; William Hayley, a poet; John Hoole, a scholar and translator of Tasso and Aristotle; and Daniel Braithwaite, an engineer.
Most sources also list the painter Paul Sandby.
Although the initial idea for the edition was probably not Boydell's, he was the one to seize and pursue it.
He wanted to use the edition to facilitate the development of a British school of history painting.
The "magnificent and accurate" Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was the focus of the enterprise.
The print folio and the gallery were simply offshoots of the main project.
In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that "splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition".
Boydell was responsible for the "splendor", and George Steevens, a renowned Shakespearean editor, was responsible for the "correctness of text".
The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages.
Even the quality of the paper was extraordinarily high.
The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the customer desired.
The first volumes of the Dramatick Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805.
The edition was financed through a subscription campaign in which the buyers would offer partial payment up front and then pay the remaining sum on delivery.
This practice was necessitated by the fact that over Â£350,000â€”an enormous sum at the timeâ€”was eventually spent on the enterprise.
When it opened on 4 May 1789 at 52 Pall Mall, the Shakespeare Gallery contained 34 paintings and by the end of its run it had between 167 and 170.
The Gallery itself was a hit with the public and became a fashionable attraction.
It took over the public's imagination and became an end in and of itself.
To illustrate the edition and to provide images for the folio, Boydell obtained the assistance of the most eminent painters and engravers of the day.
Artists included Richard Westall, Thomas Stothard, George Romney, Henry Fuseli, Benjamin West, Angelica Kauffmann, Robert Smirke, John Opie, and Boydell's nephew and business partner, Josiah Boydell.
Among the engravers were Francesco Bartolozzi and Thomas Kirk.
Boydellâ€™s relationships with his artists, particularly his illustrators, was generally congenial.
James Northcote praised Boydellâ€™s liberal payments.
He wrote in an 1821 letter that Boydell "did more for the advancement of the arts in England than the whole mass of the nobility put together!
He paid me more nobly than any other person has done; and his memory I shall every hold in reverence".
At the beginning of the enterprise, reactions were generally positive.
Two reviews from the most influential newspapers in London at the time solidified and validated the public's interest in the project and the artists' efforts.
However, there was also some criticism.
In particular the satirical engraver James Gillray appears to have been peeved at not being commissioned to engrave any of the Shakespeare scenes and, in revenge, published Shakespeare Sacrificed: Or the Offering to Avarice just six weeks after the gallery opened.
Gillray followed up with further cartoons such as Boydell sacrificing the Works of Shakespeare to the Devil of Money-Bags.
As the project dragged on, the criticism increased.
Yet, Boydell's project still inspired imitators.
Thomas Macklin attempted to found a Poet's Gallery similar to the Shakespeare Gallery and several histories of England on the scale of the Shakespeare edition were also started.
However, like Boydell's venture, they ultimately ended in financial disaster.
The folio, which collected together the engravings from the paintings, has been the most lasting legacy of the Boydell enterprise: it was reissued throughout the 19th century and scholars have described it as a precursor to the modern coffee table book.

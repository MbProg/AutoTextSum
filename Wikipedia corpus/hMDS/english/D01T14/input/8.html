		<h1>Boydell Shakespeare Gallery - Boydell's Shakespeare Venture</h1>
		
		<div id="content">

				<div class="left_holder">
					<div class="main"><p><b>Boydell's Shakespeare Venture</b></p><p>Boydell's Shakespeare project contained three parts: an illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays; a folio of prints from the <a href="/web/20160408161033/http://www.liquisearch.com/what_is_gallery" title="What is gallery?">gallery</a> (originally intended to be a folio of prints from the edition of Shakespeare's plays); and a public gallery where the original paintings for the prints would hang.</p>
<p>The idea of a grand Shakespeare edition was conceived during a dinner at the home of Josiah <a href="/web/20160408161033/http://www.liquisearch.com/what_is_boydell" title="What is Boydell?">Boydell</a> (John's nephew) in late 1786. Five important accounts of the occasion survive. From these, a guest list and a reconstruction of the conversation have been assembled. The guest list reflects the range of Boydell's contacts in the artistic world: it included Benjamin West, painter to King George III; George Romney, a renowned portrait painter; George Nicol, bookseller to the king; William Hayley, a poet; John Hoole, a scholar and translator of Tasso and Aristotle; and Daniel Braithwaite, secretary to the postmaster general and a patron of artists such as Romney and Angelica Kauffmann. Most accounts also place the painter Paul Sandby at the gathering.</p>
<p>Boydell wanted to use the edition to help stimulate a British school of <a href="/web/20160408161033/http://www.liquisearch.com/what_is_history_painting" title="What is history painting?">history painting</a>. He wrote in the "Preface" to the folio that he wanted "to advance that art towards maturity, and establish an English School of <a href="/web/20160408161033/http://www.liquisearch.com/what_is_historical_painting" title="What is Historical Painting?">Historical Painting</a>". A court document used by Josiah to collect debts from customers after Boydell's death relates the story of the dinner and Boydell's motivations:</p>
<p> he should like to wipe away the stigma that all foreign critics threw on this nation—that they had no genius for historical <a href="/web/20160408161033/http://www.liquisearch.com/what_is_painting" title="What is painting?">painting</a>. He said he was certain from his success in encouraging engraving that Englishmen wanted nothing but proper encouragement and a proper subject to excel in historical painting. The encouragement he would endeavor to find if a proper subject were pointed out. Mr. Nicol replied that there was one great National subject concerning which there could be no second opinion, and mentioned <a href="/web/20160408161033/http://www.liquisearch.com/what_is_shakespeare" title="What is Shakespeare?">Shakespeare</a>. The proposition was received with acclaim by the Alderman and the whole company.</p>
<p>However, as Frederick Burwick argues in his introduction to a collection of essays on the Boydell Gallery, "hatever claims Boydell might make about furthering the cause of history painting in England, the actual rallying force that brought the artists together to create the Shakespeare Gallery was the promise of engraved publication and distribution of their works."</p>
<p>After the initial success of the Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in imitation of the Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell the idea for the gallery. James Northcote claimed that his <i>Death of Wat Tyler</i> and <i>Murder of the Princes in the Tower</i> had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.</p>
<p>The logistics of the enterprise were difficult to organise. Boydell and Nicol wanted to produce an illustrated edition of a multi-volume work and intended to bind and sell the 72 large prints separately in a <a href="/web/20160408161033/http://www.liquisearch.com/what_is_folio" title="What is folio?">folio</a>. A gallery was required to exhibit the paintings from which the prints were drawn. The edition was to be financed through a subscription campaign, during which the buyers would pay part of the price up front and the remainder on delivery. This unusual practice was necessitated by the fact that over £350,000—an enormous sum at the time, worth about £36 million today—was eventually spent. The gallery opened in 1789 with 34 paintings and added 33 more in 1790 when the first engravings were published. The last volume of the edition and the <i>Collection of <a href="/web/20160408161033/http://www.liquisearch.com/what_are_prints" title="What are Prints?">Prints</a></i> were published in 1803. In the middle of the project, Boydell decided that he could make more money if he published different prints in the folio than in the <a href="/web/20160408161033/http://www.liquisearch.com/what_is_illustrated_edition" title="What is illustrated edition?">illustrated edition</a>; as a result, the two sets of images are not identical.</p>
<p>Advertisements were issued and placed in newspapers. When a subscription was circulated for a medal to be struck, the copy read: "The encouragers of this great national undertaking will also have the satisfaction to know, that their names will be handed down to Posterity, as the Patrons of Native Genius, enrolled with their own hands, in the same book, with the best of Sovereigns." The language of both the advertisement and the medal emphasised the role each subscriber played in the patronage of the arts. The subscribers were primarily middle-class Londoners, not aristocrats. Edmund Malone, himself an editor of a rival Shakespeare <a href="/web/20160408161033/http://www.liquisearch.com/what_is_edition" title="What is edition?">edition</a>, wrote that "before the scheme was well-formed, or the proposals entirely printed off, near six hundred persons eagerly set down their names, and paid their subscriptions to a set of books and prints that will cost each person, I think, about ninety guineas; and on looking over the list, there were not above twenty names among them that anybody knew".</p></div><p>Read more about this topic:&nbsp; <a href="/web/20160408161033/http://www.liquisearch.com/boydell_shakespeare_gallery">Boydell Shakespeare Gallery</a></p>

<p><i>Report of the Committee to whom were referred the Communications
of various State, relative to the Resolutions of the last
General Assembly of this State, concerning the Alien and Sedition
Laws.</i></p>
<p>Whatever room might be found in the proceedings of
some of the states, who have disapproved of the resolutions
of the General Assembly of this commonwealth,
passed on the 21st day of December, 1798, for painful remarks
on the spirit and manner of those proceedings, it
appears to the committee most consistent with the duty, as
well as dignity, of the General Assembly, to hasten an
oblivion of every circumstance which might be construed
into a diminution of mutual respect, confidence, and affection,
among the members of the Union.</p>
<p>The committee have deemed it a more useful task to
revise, with a critical eye, the resolutions which have met
with their disapprobation; to examine fully the several objections
and arguments which have appeared against
them; and to inquire whether there can be any errors of
fact, of principle, or of reasoning, which the candor of the
General Assembly ought to acknowledge and correct.</p>
<p>The <i>first</i> of the resolutions is in the words following:--</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;<i>Resolved,</i> That the General Assembly of Virginia
doth unequivocally express a firm resolution
to maintain and defend the Constitution of the
United States, and the Constitution of this state,
against every aggression, either foreign or domestic;
and that they will support the government of
the United States in all measures warranted by
the former.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No unfavorable comment can have been made on the
sentiments here expressed. To maintain and defend the
Constitution of the United States, and of their own state,
against every aggression, both foreign and domestic, and
to support the government of the United States in all measures
warranted by their Constitution, are duties which the
General Assembly ought always to feel, and to which, on
such an occasion, it was evidently proper to express their
sincere and firm adherence.</p>
<p>In their <i>next</i> resolution--</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;The General Assembly most solemnly declares
a warm attachment to the union of the states, to
maintain which it pledges all its powers; and that,
for this end, it is their duty to watch over and
oppose every infraction of those principles which<!--[Volume 1, Page 294]-->
constitute the only basis of that Union, because a
faithful observance of them can alone secure its
existence and the public happiness.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The observation just made is equally applicable to this
solemn declaration of warm attachment to the Union, and
this solemn pledge to maintain it; nor can any question
arise among enlightened friends of the Union, as to the
duty of watching over and opposing every infraction of
those principles which constitute its basis, and a faithful
observance of which can alone secure its existence, and the
public happiness thereon depending.</p>
<p>The <i>third</i> resolution is in the words following:--</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily
declare, that it views the powers of the
federal government, as resulting from the compact
to which the states are parties, as limited by
the plain sense and intention of the instrument
constituting that compact--as no further valid
than they are authorized by the grants enumerated
in that compact; and that, in case of a deliberate,
palpable, and dangerous exercise of other
powers, not granted by the said compact, the
states who are parties thereto have the right, and
are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the
progress of the evil and for maintaining, within
their respective limits, the authorities, rights, and
liberties, appertaining to them.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this resolution the committee have bestowed all the
attention which its importance merits. They have <i>scanned</i>
it not merely with a strict, but with a severe eye; and they
feel confidence in pronouncing that, in its just and fair
construction, it is unexceptionably true in its several positions,
as well as constitutional and conclusive in its inferences.</p>
<p>The resolution declares, <i>first,</i> that &quot;it views the powers
of the federal government as resulting from the compact
to which the states are parties;&quot; in other words, that the
federal powers are derived from the Constitution; and
that the Constitution is a compact to which the states are
parties.</p>
<p>Clear as the position must seem, that the federal powers
are derived from the Constitution, and from that alone,
the committee are not unapprized of a late doctrine which
opens another source of federal powers, not less extensive
and important than it is new and unexpected. The examination
of this doctrine will be most conveniently connected
with a review of a succeeding resolution. The committee
satisfy themselves here with briefly remarking that,
in all the contemporary discussions and comments which
the Constitution underwent, it was constantly justified and
recommended on the ground that the powers not given to
the government were withheld from it; and that, if any
doubt could have existed on this subject, under the original
text of the Constitution, it is removed, as far as words
could remove it, by the 12th amendment, now a part of
the Constitution, which expressly declares, &quot;that the powers
not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states
respectively, or to the people.&quot;</p>
<p>The other position involved in this branch of the resolution,
namely, &quot;that the states are parties to the Constitution,&quot;
or compact, is, in the judgment of the committee,
equally free from objection. It is indeed true that the term
&quot;states&quot; is sometimes used in a vague sense, and sometimes
in different senses, according to the subject to which it is
applied. Thus it sometimes means the separate sections of
territory occupied by the political societies within each;
sometimes the particular governments established by those
societies; sometimes those societies as organized into those
particular governments; and lastly, it means the people
composing those political societies, in their highest sovereign
capacity. Although it might be wished that the perfection
of language admitted less diversity in the signification
of the same words, yet little inconvenience is produced by
it, where the true sense can be collected with certainty
from the different applications. In the present instance,
whatever different construction of the term &quot;states,&quot; in the
resolution, may have been entertained, all will at least concur
in that last mentioned; because in that sense the Constitution
was submitted to the &quot;states;&quot; in that sense the
&quot;states&quot; ratified it; and in that sense of the term &quot;states,&quot;
they are consequently parties to the compact from which
the powers of the federal government result.</p>
<p>The next position is, that the General Assembly views
the powers of the federal government &quot;as limited by the
plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting
that compact,&quot; and &quot;as no further valid than they are authorized
by the grants therein enumerated.&quot; It does not
seem possible that any just objection can lie against either
of these clauses. The first amounts merely to a declaration
that the compact ought to have the interpretation plainly
intended by the parties to it; the other, to a declaration
that it ought to have the execution and effect intended by
them. If the powers granted be valid, it is solely because
they are granted; and if the granted powers are valid because
granted, all other powers not granted must not be
valid.</p>
<p>The resolution, having taken this view of the federal
compact, proceeds to infer, &quot;That, in case of a deliberate,
palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not
granted by the said compact, the states, who are parties
thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose
for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining,
within their respective limits, the authorities,
rights, and liberties, appertaining to them.&quot;</p>
<p>It appears to your committee to be a plain principle,
founded in common sense, illustrated by common practice,
and essential to the nature of compacts, that, where
resort can be had to no tribunal superior to the authority
of the parties, the parties themselves must be the rightful
judges, in the last resort, whether the bargain made has
been pursued or violated. The Constitution of the United
States was formed by the sanction of the states, given by
each in its sovereign capacity. It adds to the stability and
dignity, as well as to the authority, of the Constitution, that
it rests on this legitimate and solid foundation. The states,
then, being the parties to the constitutional compact, and
in their sovereign capacity, it follows of necessity that there
can be no tribunal, above their authority, to decide, in the<!--[Volume 1, Page 295]-->
last resort, whether the compact made by them be violated;
and consequently, that, as the parties to it, they must
themselves decide, in the last resort, such questions as may
be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition.</p>
<p>It does not follow, however, because the states, as sovereign
parties to their constitutional compact, must ultimately
decide whether it has been violated, that such a decision
ought to be interposed either in a hasty manner or
on doubtful and inferior occasions. Even in the case of
ordinary conventions between different nations, where, by
the strict rule of interpretation, a breach of a part may be
deemed a breach of the whole,--every part being deemed
a condition of every other part, and of the whole,--it is
always laid down that the breach must be both wilful and
material, to justify an application of the rule. But in the
case of an intimate and constitutional union, like that of
the United States, it is evident that the interposition of the
parties, in their sovereign capacity, can be called for by
occasions only deeply and essentially affecting the vital
principles of their political system.</p>
<p>The resolution has, accordingly guarded against any
misapprehension of its object, by expressly requiring, for
such an interposition, &quot;the case of a deliberate, palpable,
and dangerous breach of the Constitution, by the exercise
of powers not granted by it.&quot; It must be a case not of a
light and transient nature, but of a nature dangerous to
the great purposes for which the Constitution was established.
It must be a case, moreover, not obscure or doubtful
in its construction, but plain and palpable. Lastly, it
must be a case not resulting from a partial consideration
or hasty determination, but a case stamped with a final
consideration and deliberate adherence. It is not necessary,
because the resolution does not require, that the
question should be discussed, how far the exercise of any
particular power, ungranted by the Constitution, would
justify the interposition of the parties to it. As cases might
easily be stated, which none would contend ought to fall
within that description,--cases, on the other hand, might,
with equal ease, be stated, so flagrant and so fatal as to
unite every opinion in placing them within the description.</p>
<p>But the resolution has done more than guard against
misconstruction, by expressly referring to cases of a deliberate,
palpable, and dangerous nature. It specifies the object
of the interposition, which it contemplates to be solely
that of arresting the progress of the evil of usurpation,
and of maintaining the authorities, rights, and liberties,
appertaining to the states as parties to the Constitution.</p>
<p>From this view of the resolution, it would seem inconceivable
that it can incur any just disapprobation from
those who, laying aside all momentary impressions, and
recollecting the genuine source and object of the Federal
Constitution, shall candidly and accurately interpret the
meaning of the General Assembly. If the deliberate exercise
of dangerous powers, palpably withheld by the Constitution,
could not justify the parties to it in interposing
even so far as to arrest the progress of the evil, and
thereby to preserve the Constitution itself, as well as to
provide for the safety of the parties to it, there would be
an end to all relief from usurped power, and a direct subversion
of the rights specified or recognized under all the
state constitutions, as well as a plain denial of the fundamental
principle on which our independence itself was declared.</p>
<p>But it is objected, that the judicial authority is to be regarded
as the sole expositor of the Constitution in the last
resort; and it may be asked for what reason the declaration
by the General Assembly, supposing it to be theoretically
true, could be required at the present day, and in so solemn|a manner.</p>
<p>On this objection it might be observed, first, that there
may be instances of usurped power, which the forms of
the Constitution would never draw within the control of
the judicial department; secondly, that, if the decision of
the judiciary be raised above the authority of the sovereign
parties to the Constitution, the decisions of the other departments,
not carried by the forms of the Constitution
before the judiciary, must be equally authoritative and
final with the decisions of that department. But the proper
answer to the objection is, that the resolution of the General
Assembly relates to those great and extraordinary
cases, in which all the forms of the Constitution may prove
ineffectual against infractions dangerous to the essential
rights of the parties to it. The resolution supposes that
dangerous powers, not delegated, may not only be
usurped and executed by the other departments, but that
the judicial department, also, may exercise or sanction
dangerous powers beyond the grant of the Constitution;
and, consequently, that the ultimate right of the parties to
the Constitution, to judge whether the compact has been
dangerously violated, must extend to violations by one delegated
authority as well as by another--by the judiciary as
well as by the executive, or the legislature.</p>
<p>However true, therefore, it may be, that the judicial department
is, in all questions submitted to it by the forms
of the Constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort
must necessarily be deemed the last in relation to the authorities
of the other departments of the government; not
in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional
compact, from which the judicial, as well as the other departments,
hold their delegated trusts. On any other hypothesis,
the delegation of judicial power would annul the
authority delegating it; and the concurrence of this department
with the others in usurped powers, might subvert
forever, and beyond the possible reach of any rightful
remedy, the very Constitution which all were instituted to
preserve.</p>
<p>The truth declared in the resolution being established,
the expediency of making the declaration at the present
day may safely be left to the temperate consideration and
candid judgment of the American public. It will be remembered,
that a frequent recurrence to fundamental
principles is solemnly enjoined by most of the state constitutions,
and particularly by our own, as a necessary safeguard
against the danger of degeneracy, to which republics
are liable, as well as other governments, though in a
less degree than others. And a fair comparison of the political
doctrines not unfrequent at the present day, with
those which characterized the epoch of our revolution,
and which form the basis of our republican constitutions,
will best determine whether the declaratory recurrence<!--[Volume 1, Page 296]-->
here made to those principles ought to be viewed as unseasonable
and improper, or as a vigilant discharge of an
important duty. The authority of constitutions over governments,
and of the sovereignty of the people over constitutions,
are truths which are at all times necessary to be
kept in mind; and at no time, perhaps, more necessary
than at present.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">. . . . .</p>
<p>These observations appear to form a satisfactory reply
to every objection which is not founded on a misconception
of the terms employed in the resolutions. There is one
other, however, which may be of too much importance not
to be added. It cannot be forgotten that, among the arguments
addressed to those who apprehended danger to liberty
from the establishment of the general government
over so great a country, the appeal was emphatically made
to the intermediate existence of the state governments between
the people and that government, to the vigilance
with which they would descry the first symptoms of usurpation,
and to the promptitude with which they would
sound the alarm to the public. This argument was probably
not without its effect; and if it was a proper one then
to recommend the establishment of a constitution, it must
be a proper one now to assist in its interpretation.</p>

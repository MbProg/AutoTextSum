<p><font SIZE="7">The Alien &amp; Sedition Acts Of 1798 and Their Irony</center>

<p><font SIZE="4"><br>
<p>The Alien &amp; Sedition Act of 1798 was passed and many had great concerns about the 
Constitutionality of this law.  James Madison himself, considered the father of the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights, wrote in <em>The Virginia Report</em>, 1800, by the Virginia House 
of Delegates, that the Sedition Act was unconstitutional, according toe Leonard Levy.  
It was his view that the First Amendment guaranteed an absolute freedom 
against the federal government, because no authority of the United States could abridge it.
<br><br>
However, Levy further explains that Madison could not support a sedition law that put into place
prior restraints, which would abridge the freedom of speech and the press.  In <em>The Virginia
Report</em>, Madison wrote, <br><br><center><em>&quot;It would seem a mockery to say that no laws should be passed
for preventing publications from being made, but that laws might be passed for punishing 
them in case they should be made.&quot;</em></center> <br><br>It is unclear, however, whether Madison had
in mind the British understanding of a sedition law, where the crown were the authority.  
This contention is worth making because of the reference Madison also makes in saying <em>&quot;this 
idea of the freedom of the press can never be admitted to be the American idea of it.&quot;</em>
<br><br>Why the distinction between an American and a British idea of free speech, but not 
a distinction between to differing ideas of a sedition law.  It would seem Levy is short 
sighted in not considering that Madison's criticisms of the Sedition Act were in the case that
it might be used as was the Seditious Libel law of tradition in England.<br><br>

Much of the <em>Report</em>, Levy later explains, was describing the <em> &quot;essential 
differences between the British government and the American Constitution,&quot;</em> which centered 
strictly around the focus of power.<br><br>

It is important to understand the history of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. 

<p>The United States finally ratified the Bill of Rights in 1791, 
a compromise to appease the Anti-Federalists who were concerned about individual rights.


<p>It is widely thought that their opposition to a Constitution lacking a Bill
of Rights was merely a political ploy.
Nonetheless, James Madison went to work on a set of amendments that 
enumerated specific rights, but did not mean that rights not enumerated 
were not valid.<img SRC="JMADISON.JPG" ALT="JAMES MADISON" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="365" HEIGHT="543">

The first of these, and considered by many the most important is the 
First Amendment to the Constitution.  It states, <br><br><em><center>&quot;Congress shall 
make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the 
free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;
or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the 
Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;</center></em>
<br>
This was not the first draft, by any means.  There were multiple drafts regarding
the freedoms that should surround religious and speech expression.<br><br>

An earlier draft, spread out over two amendments, read, <br><br><center><em>&quot;(3)Congress shall 
make no law establishing religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, 
nor shall the rights of conscience be infringed.  (4) The freedom of speech,
and of the press, and the right of the People peaceably to assemble and 
consult for their common good, and to apply to the Government for redress 
of grievances, shall not be infringed.&quot;<br><br></center></em>
It is difficult for many to get around the strong language of the Amendment, which seems
to provide the strictest form of protection for speech and the press.  Still, there
is great controversy over just how much protection this provides.<br><br>

A mere seven years later the U.S. Congress passed the Alien &amp; Sedition Acts of 1798.
There are political explanations of why these Acts were passed which center 
primarily around the state of foreign relations.  The United States was making preparations
for war against France, a world power at the time, and was greatly under manned.  Just as
well, there were many in American who were sympathetic to the French, particularly due
to their grievance with Britain.  Congress in their responses to the State of the Union Address
by President John Adams, had recognized the threat Adams outlined as it existed with
France, and pledged their backing.  It is not only reasonable, but acceptable to think that
the Alien &amp; Sedition Acts were passed for this very reason.<br>

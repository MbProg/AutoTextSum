The Brown Dog Affair Papers
"The Brown Dog Affair Papers"
"Sixty-two people sat in the lecture theatre of London’s University College Hospital. Thousands had sat there before; thousands have filled the hall since. But never has a lecture led to so much trouble"
The object is ‘The Brown Dog Affair’, a set of papers about the events that followed a vivisection on a dog in a lecture theatre at University College London (UCL) in 1903. The documents are part of UCL’s own records.
The UCL records file ‘The Brown Dog Affair’ consists mostly of correspondence between former UCL Provost Ifor Evans and physiologist Leonard Bayliss, son of Dr. William Bayliss.There are also press cuttings, a postcard, and court transcripts referring to the events of 1903, which are believed to have survived UCL bombings in World War II.

The Story in Photos
The ‘Brown Dog Affair’ started in 1903, with an experiment on a brown dog in a lecture theatre at UCL by Dr. William Bayliss. (Copyright Elliott & Fry)
Sitting amongst the students that day were two Swedish anti-vivisection activists: Miss Lind-af-Hageby and Miss Schartau. According to their records, the vivisected dog had two wounds from previous experiments and did not receive proper anaesthesia. (University College London Archives)
This was explicitly against the 1876 'Cruelty to Animals Act’, which prompted Stephen Coleridge, a barrister and a member of the National Anti-Vivisectionist Society, to publicly attack Dr. William Bayliss. Bayliss, in turn, sued Coleridge for libel in order to protect his reputation and the case was heard in 1903. Bayliss won the case. (Vanity Fair, 27 July 1910, downloaded from The Original Vanity Fair Print Company)
The events motivated anti-vivisectionist Louisa Woodward to fund a memorial for the brown dog and the Battersea Park was chosen as the location. ‘The fountain was designed to be provocative.’ The inscription read: ‘In memory of the Brown Terrier Dog Done to death in the laboratories of University College in February, 1903, after having endured vivisection ( ...) till death came to his release’. (University College London Archives)
In response, students of UCL tried to remove it twice. However, there were outnumbered by the police and anti-vivisectionists. Afterwards, the monument was constantly guarded by policemen. Following these events, there were student mass meetings, namely in Trafalgar Square, and petitions signed by 1035 students of London University asking for the statue to be removed. In 1909, the Battersea city council decided to remove the memorial. (University College London Archives)
However, a new brown dog memorial was unveiled in 1985 and can be found in Battersea Park today. Although the British Medical Journal denounced the memorial as “degrading, libellous, and offensive”, the statue has never attracted the same degree of controversy as the original one.

The Cold War and Vivisection in the 1950's: Correspondence between the Provost and L. Bayliss
Vivisection became a major issue in the last quarter of the 19th century and the years leading and following the ‘Brown Dog Affair’ further strengthen the movement.
In the 1950s, at the time of the correspondence, vivisection was still a much-publicized concern. In the 1950s, Russia and the United States were competing with each other on space projects, and on November 3r 1957 a dog named Laika became the first living creature in space. It is known that both the Americans and the Russians had extensive space programmes involving the use of live animals. At the same time, the warfare had provided the basis of an enormous amount of animal experimentation since the First World War. To this effect, animals were also being tested for the effects of poison gas and atomic bombs.There were a number of demonstrations outside the actual laboratories where vivisection was taking place, namely in England. Taking this into consideration, it comes with no surprise that one of the discussions in the correspondence is the publication of Bayliss’s typewritten facsimile and whether or not the account should be made public.
On April 20 1955, Provost Ifor Evans is quoted saying "I am rather of the view that it would be wiser at this stage not to publish it, but to keep it in our records". One year later, the issue is mentioned again by L. Bayliss: on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the erection of the statue of the Brown Dog, Bayliss suggests that the Journal of the U.C.L Students Physiological Society should publish an account of the affair. Furthermore, Bayliss will edit the account, "chiefly by the omission of any comments that might be regarded as at all derogatory". However, Evans is quoted again showing his uncertainty on the issue: "I think it is very important that the students should know about this whole affair, On the other hand, I feel like the publication may raise the whole anti-vivisectionist issue’ [...] the less publicity we have, the smoother things will be". Furthermore, the men involved consider important to make sure that the account contains no possible grounds for a counter libel action on the part of Miss Lind af Hageby, one of the Swedish activists present in the lecture, who was still alive at the time. Thus, the account of the events is published on 1954, after making sure that there is no ground for a legal action.
There is a clear transition from the 1900’s – when one could sue for defamation on grounds of a vivisection and win – in comparison with the 1950s, when the issue had become much more widely criticized and one had to be cautious in publicly taking a position.

"The Brown Dog Affair Papers"
"Sixty-two people sat in the lecture theatre of London’s University College Hospital. Thousands had sat there before; thousands have filled the hall since. But never has a lecture led to so much trouble"
The object is ‘The Brown Dog Affair’, a set of papers about the events that followed a vivisection on a dog in a lecture theatre at University College London (UCL) in 1903. The documents are part of UCL’s own records.
The UCL records file ‘The Brown Dog Affair’ consists mostly of correspondence between former UCL Provost Ifor Evans and physiologist Leonard Bayliss, son of Dr. William Bayliss.There are also press cuttings, a postcard, and court transcripts referring to the events of 1903, which are believed to have survived UCL bombings in World War II.

“Cloud Gate is the tops”
Reviewed June 10, 2015
Cloud Gate, located within the Millennium Park area of the Loop community in down-town Chicago has to be one of the top, free, public interactive sculptures in the world.
No-one can resist gazing at their reflection, taking photographs, and group 'selfies' as they wander around this attraction.
This attraction brings out the child in everyone.

“Just as I imagined”
Reviewed June 9, 2015
Cloud Gate, also known as The Bean, is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Chicago.
We arrived on a gloomy rainy afternoon, and with only 1.5 days in Chicago, I grabbed the complementary umbrella at the hotel lobby and walked down all the way from the top end of the Magnificent Mile down to Millennial Park's Cloud Gate.
It was worth it!
With only a few others there, it's rare to arrive to the Bean with a few tourists around gathering for photos.
I had the place to myself and got great shots of Cloud Gate with Chicago at it's gloomy, rainy best despite not having much of the city's reflection coming through on the bean.
It was beautiful.
I returned the next morning as it was sunny.
The park was packed full of photographing tourist, but it was well worth it.
Cloud Gate was beautiful on a sunny day.
The city's reflection was clear.
Definitely worth a visit.
Even just for a quick 5 minute stop.

“From the view of a local”
Reviewed June 9, 2015
I never tire of visiting "the Bean."
Every time I bring an out of towner to see it they are always enchanted as am I.
It is, after all, a reflection of the people in the city and possibly one of the most successful public artworks I can think of.

“A great bean as attraction”
Reviewed June 9, 2015
I was there in October 2011 and i just can say that it's very good idea to do a such work.
I mean it's a great work especially when it's free to see !
I spent some time there and came up with a great idea too !
As you can see on the picture, it's very touristic and that's normal.
Of course it would be great to see no one there.
There are seats and tables so you can have a rest like i did.
I defenitely recommand this free attraction.

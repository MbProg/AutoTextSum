Piedmont Park's Original Watering Hole
Chicago, The Blues Capital of the World
Chicago Skyline and The Bean
Visitors take their best Chicago photographs in front of the iconic Millennium Park sculpture called Cloud Gate and known colloquially as “The Bean.”
Designed by Anish Kapoor and constructed from 168 stainless steel plates with no visible seams, the polished surfaces of this 33ft tall sculpture reflect infinite variations of the Chicago skyline.

The Bold Sculpture Of Cloud Gate In Chicago Illinois Pictured On An Acrylic Fridge Magnet
Anish Kapoor’s incredible Cloud Gate Sculpture is a fitting centre piece for the AT&T Plaza.
During the winter months, from mid-November to mid-March, the plaza can also be used as a place to view McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink; the rink attracts approximately one hundred thousand skaters each open period.
To add to the atmosphere, during the Christmas holiday season, carols are often sung on the plaza.
For the rest of the year the plaza is definitely dominated by the innovative and impressive Cloud Gate Sculpture as seen on this attractive acrylic fridge magnet from the catalogues of World Wide Gifts .
The Works Of Art Of Chicago, Illinois
The Cloud Gate Sculpture is not the only work of art in Chicago worth seeing.
The Buckingham Fountain, or to give it its full title the Clarence Buckingham Memorial Fountain, was donated to the city by Kate Buckingham in memory of her brother and was dedicated in 1927.
It looks a little like a wedding cake with its layers and its waters flow during the summer months when light shows are held there.
The structure is lit during the winter but the water is turned off.
Outside the Daley Center in Chicago is a statue by the world famous Pablo Picasso.
It was given to the city by the artist in 1967.
There is no title to the statue and the subject is unknown.
Not just a piece of art then but also a topic of conversation; as is the Cloud Gate Sculpture which features on our acrylic fridge magnet .

Everyone pictures the jellybean when they hear Chicago and Anish Kapoors art does not disappoint!
It looks great with the city in the background and is fun to go see.
Try and go early of a bit later because at 12 you'll hit a rush of people and will be taking pictures of strangers heads alllll day!

Not sure why it's called "The Bean" except that it looks like a giant bean.
It's pretty crowed on the weekends, but u can find a time when there are not that many people around if you like to get those pictures with less people in them, u just still might have to wait a little for that perfect moment, it's in a pretty popular spot and always seems to have a few people around it.
But it's a pretty neat piece of art and something worth checking out, plus it's free and something you don't see every day.

Loved it!
Wish we would have gone when it wasn't quite so busy.
Our 2-year old grandson was enthralled.

A lovely piece of modern public art in a great park adjacent to the city and art museum.

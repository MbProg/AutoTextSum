“Just as I imagined”
Reviewed June 9, 2015
Cloud Gate, also known as The Bean, is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Chicago.
We arrived on a gloomy rainy afternoon, and with only 1.5 days in Chicago, I grabbed the complementary umbrella at the hotel lobby and walked down all the way from the top end of the Magnificent Mile down to Millennial Park's Cloud Gate.
It was worth it!
With only a few others there, it's rare to arrive to the Bean with a few tourists around gathering for photos.
I had the place to myself and got great shots of Cloud Gate with Chicago at it's gloomy, rainy best despite not having much of the city's reflection coming through on the bean.
It was beautiful.
I returned the next morning as it was sunny.
The park was packed full of photographing tourist, but it was well worth it.
Cloud Gate was beautiful on a sunny day.
The city's reflection was clear.
Definitely worth a visit.
Even just for a quick 5 minute stop.

“A great bean as attraction”

I was there in October 2011 and i just can say that it's very good idea to do a such work.
I mean it's a great work especially when it's free to see !
I spent some time there and came up with a great idea too !
As you can see on the picture, it's very touristic and that's normal.
Of course it would be great to see no one there.
There are seats and tables so you can have a rest like i did.
I defenitely recommand this free attraction.

Yesterday, the High Court handed down its decision in the case of  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty  Limited & Others [2007] HCA 38. The decision is of particular  interest to departments and agencies engaged in procurement, and  businesses dealing with government. It is a timely reminder about the  value of competitive procurement processes.

At the time of the alleged breaches Baxter was, for all practical  purposes, the sole supplier of high volume, low value, sterile fluids in  Australia. These fluids are an essential item for every hospital in  Australia. Baxter also supplied low volume, high value products with  very specialised uses (such as peritoneal dialysis) - but there were  rival companies seeking to supply competing products.
Between 1998 and 2001, Baxter responded to a series of tenders  called by State and Territory health purchasing authorities, typically  offering to supply its products on the following alternate bases. â€¦

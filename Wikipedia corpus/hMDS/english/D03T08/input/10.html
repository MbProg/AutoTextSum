<p align="center"><b>THE NEED TO CLOSE THE &#8216;TAKE ADVANTAGE&#8217; GAP IN
THE REGULATION OF UNILATERAL ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT</b></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>Arlen Duke*</b></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>Unilateral anti-competitive conduct is regulated by <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 46</a> of the

corporation with &#8216;market power&#8217; from &#8216;taking advantage&#8217;
of that market power for a &#8216;proscribed
anti-competitive purpose&#8217;. 
The very low success rate of actions brought under <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
46</a><span class="sup"><a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></span> has led many to
argue that these elements are too difficult to prove and, in turn, that <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
46</a> needs to be amended if businesses with a small share of the market are to be
appropriately protected from anti-competitive conduct
engaged in by their larger
rivals.  The Senate Economics References Committee (<b>Senate Committee</b>)
shared this view and recommended that amendments be made to the &#8216;market
power&#8217; and &#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirements
in <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section

Amendment Act (No. 1) 2007</a> </i>(Cth) (<b>Amendment Act</b>) in a manner largely
consistent with the Government&#8217;s response to the Senate Committee&#8217;s
report.  The changes to section
46 introduced by the Amendment Act relate mainly
to the market power requirement and are mostly declaratory in nature. 
Provisions
dealing specifically with the issue of predatory pricing have also
been added.</p>
<p>Despite the recommendations of the Senate Economics References Committee,
none of the changes made by the Amendment Act relate to
the substantive
operation of the &#8216;take advantage&#8217;
requirement.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></span>  The
Government dismissed such amendments as unnecessary on the basis that the case
law provides a clear and consistent interpretation
of the term that does not
hamper the operation of section
46.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></span>  </p>
<p>This article argues that the Government&#8217;s decision to reject the
amendments proposed by the Senate Committee should be revisited.
 The first part
of the article examines the findings of the two most recent reviews of the TPA
and outlines the changes introduced
by the Amendment Act.  The second part of
the article begins with an explanation of the two main tests employed by the
courts to
determine whether a business has taken advantage of its market power
and notes that prior to the High Court&#8217;s decision in <i>Rural Press Ltd v
ACCC </i><a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2003/75.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[2003] HCA 75</a>;  <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282003%29%20216%20CLR%2053" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2003) 216 CLR 53</a> (<b>Rural Press</b>), the courts had not drawn a
clear distinction between these two tests.   The third part of the article
examines the reasoning that
led the majority in <i>Rural Press</i> to employ the
narrower of the two tests.  Part four of the article considers section
46&#8217;s legislative history and concludes
that the approach adopted by the
majority is legally correct.  The article concludes with the observation that,
as the legally correct
interpretation of the &#8216;take advantage&#8217;
requirement causes a gap in the coverage of section 46, the Government&#8217;s
decision to reject the need to amend the operation of the &#8216;take
advantage&#8217; requirement should be revisited.  This is
especially the case
as the gap could be closed without introducing an unacceptable level of
uncertainty and without running the risk
that the provision will inadvertently
catch competitive conduct (which is more than can be said for some of the
provisions of the
Amendment Act).</p>

<p align="center"><b>A <i>Dawson Committee recommendation</i></b></p>
<p>The ability of <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 46</a> to effectively regulate unilateral anti-competitive
conduct has been considered in two relatively recent reviews of the TPA.  The
first of these was the <i>Review of the Competition Provisions of the <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade
Practices Act</a></i> (<b>Dawson Committee</b>), which was released in January 2003.
The Dawson Committee clearly identified the purpose requirement as its main
focus.  This is
most likely because of the number of submissions (including a
detailed submission by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
(<b>ACCC</b>)) relating to the possible introduction of an effects test designed
to overcome difficulties believed to be associated with establishing
that a
business had acted for a proscribed anti-competitive purpose.  The introduction
of an &#8216;effects test&#8217; would involve
adding the words &#8216;or with

<p>The &#8216;market power&#8217; and &#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirements
were all but overlooked by the Dawson Committee.  The
Dawson Committee Report
does not mention the &#8216;market power&#8217; requirement other than in
passing and although the &#8216;take
advantage&#8217; requirement is mentioned,
it is only discussed in the context of the requirement&#8217;s ability to
safeguard against
potential overreach of the effects test which the ACCC was so
strongly in favour
of.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>The Dawson Committee ultimately concluded that <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 46</a> did not require
amendment.  In reaching this conclusion, the Committee appears to have been most
influenced by its finding that the
difficulties claimed to be associated with
proving purpose were
overstated<span class="sup"><a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[6]</a></span> and that
the proposed effects test would not be able to appropriately distinguish between
legitimate (competitive) and illegitimate
(anti-competitive) behaviour.  </p>
<p>However two High Court decisions handed down after the Dawson Committee
submitted its report suggest that the &#8216;market power&#8217;
(<i>Boral</i>)<span class="sup"><a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[7]</a></span> and
&#8216;take advantage&#8217; (<i>Rural
Press</i>)<span class="sup"><a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[8]</a></span>
requirements pose a greater threat to the ability of <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 46</a> to effectively
regulate unilateral anti-competitive conduct.  In March 2003, the Dawson
Committee reconsidered its findings in light
of the <i>Boral</i> decision and
decided that there was still no need to amend <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 46.</a>  At the same time, the
Dawson Committee noted that its recommendation may need to be revisited after a
number of other cases before
the courts at that time were
decided.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[9]</a></span>   <i>Rural
Press</i>, in which a majority of the High Court interpreted the &#8216;take
advantage&#8217; requirement quite narrowly, was one such case.
 </p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>B <i>Senate Committee &#8211; market power
requirement</i></b></p>
<p>In June 2003, less than six months after the Dawson Committee delivered its
report, the Senate Economics References Committee (<b>Senate Committee</b>) was
asked to specifically consider whether the TPA adequately protected small
businesses from anti-competitive conduct and unfair
practices.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[10]</a></span>  When
examining the ability of <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 46</a> to provide such protection, the Senate
Committee focussed on the limitations imposed by the &#8216;market power&#8217;
and &#8216;take
advantage&#8217; requirements.  </p>
<p>The Senate Committee delivered its report in March 2004.  Most of the
amendments to the operation of the &#8216;market power&#8217;
requirement
proposed by the Senate Committee were declaratory in nature, made no change to
the existing law and are unlikely to encourage
the courts to conduct a <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
46</a> analysis any
differently.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[11]</a></span> 
Nevertheless, they were given effect to by the Amendment Act.  As a result,
section 46 now contains further direction as to how
to determine whether a
business has market
power<span class="sup"><a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[12]</a></span> and also
expressly provides that the courts are permitted to have regard to sustained
periods of below cost pricing and the reasons
for such pricing when determining
whether section 46 has been
breached.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[13]</a></span>  In
addition, section 46 now expressly prohibits the misuse of market power in both
the market in which the power is held as well
as any other
market.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[14]</a></span> 
Amendments that would have changed the law in a manner that made it easier to
establish that a business has market power (such as
the recommendation that the
court be allowed to have regard to a business&#8217;s financial strength when
assessing the business&#8217;s
market power) were rejected by the Government. 
As this paper deals with gaps in the coverage of section 46 caused by the
&#8216;take
advantage&#8217; requirement, the appropriateness of the
Government&#8217;s response to the recommendations relating to the &#8216;market
power&#8217; requirement will not be further explored.  Rather, the
Government&#8217;s decision not to amend the &#8216;take advantage&#8217;
requirement will be the focus of analysis.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>C <i>Senate Committee &#8211; take advantage
requirement</i></b></p>
<p>When considering the need to amend the &#8216;take advantage&#8217;
requirement, the Senate Committee dealt with the repercussions
of the definition
given to the &#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement in <i>Rural Press</i>,
which is discussed in detail in the second part of this paper.  The Senate
Committee noted that in <i>Rural Press </i>the High Court narrowed the
definition of the &#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement by holding that it is
not enough to show that
the firm would not have been likely to act as it did if
it did not possess market power.  Rather, a firm will only be held to have
&#8216;taken advantage&#8217; of its market power if it could not have acted as
it did if it did not have market power.  </p>
<p>To overcome this narrowing of what constitutes a &#8216;taking
advantage&#8217; of market power, the Senate Committee recommended
that a
declaratory provision be added to section 46 that directs the court to consider
a range of factors when assessing whether
the impugned conduct involves a
&#8216;taking advantage&#8217; of market power.  Specifically, the court would
be directed to consider
whether:</p>
<p>(a)	the conduct of the corporation was materially facilitated by its
substantial market power;</p>
<p>(b)	the corporation engages in the conduct in reliance upon its substantial
market power;</p>
<p>(c)	the corporation in question would have been likely to engage in the
conduct if it lacked a substantial degree of market power;
or</p>
<p>(d)	the conduct of the corporation is otherwise related to its substantial
degree of market power.</p>
<p>The declaratory provision recommended by the Senate Committee is itself
ambiguous and may not reverse the narrowing of the &#8216;take
advantage&#8217;
requirement in <i>Rural Press</i>.  This is because in some circumstances the
factors may send conflicting signals as to whether the conduct involves a taking
advantage
of market power.  For example, it is not clear what happens where a
firm engages in conduct that it could have engaged in without
the market power
(which factors (a) and (b) suggest does not involve a taking advantage of market
power) but that it would not have
been likely to engage in if it lacked a
substantial degree of market power (which factor (c) suggests involves a taking
advantage
of market power). </p>
<p>The Government Senators who were members of the Senate Committee were of the
opinion that the current interpretation of the &#8216;take
advantage&#8217;
requirement was not ambiguous and did not hinder the operation of section
46.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[15]</a></span>  As a result,
the Amendment Act did not contain the declaratory provision recommended by the
Senate Committee.  The sections of this
paper that follow develop an argument
that whilst the declaratory provision recommended for inclusion in section 46 by
the Senate
Committee may be flawed, there is nonetheless a need to introduce
amendments that change the way in which a &#8216;taking advantage&#8217;
of
market power can be proven.  </p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>C <i>The &#8216;Birdsville Amendment&#8217; &#8211;
subsections 46(1AA) &amp; 46(1AB)</i></b></p>
<p>The Amendment Act also introduced provisions designed to deal specifically
with the issue of predatory pricing.  Section 46 now prohibits
a corporation
with a &#8216;substantial <i>share</i> of the market&#8217; from pricing its
goods or services below &#8216;the <i>relevant cost</i>&#8217; for a
&#8216;sustained period&#8217; for the purpose of damaging a
competitor.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[16]</a></span>  This
amendment does not stem from the reports of the Dawson Committee, the Senate
Committee or for that matter the recommendations
of ACCC or Industry Groups. 
Rather, they were drafted by a single member of the Senate (Senator Barnaby
Joyce) in the Birdsville
Pub (it is for this reason that they amendments have
been dubbed the &#8216;Birdsville
Amendments&#8217;).<span class="sup"><a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[17]</a></span>
</p>
<p>Unlike the market power amendments discussed above, the Birdsville Amendments
change the operation of section 46 in a significant
way.  For this reason, the
author feels provide compelled to comment briefly upon concerns raised by these
amendments.</p>
<p>The Birdsville Amendments introduce considerable uncertainty into the law by
introducing the concepts of &#8216;substantial market
share&#8217;,
&#8216;sustained period&#8217; and &#8216;relevant cost&#8217;.  Until the
meanings of these terms have been determined
by the courts, this uncertainty has
the potential to discourage discounting for fear of being caught by the
provision.  In addition,
the predatory pricing prohibition introduced by the
Birdsville Amendments will apply more broadly than other parts of section 46
because it applies to firms with a substantial share of the market rather than
firms with substantial market power.  It has been
long recognised that market
share is but one factor relevant when determining whether a firm has market
power, and in turn the ability
to manipulate the market.  Furthermore the market
share enquiry does not require the courts to consider the most important
indicator
of firm&#8217;s to manipulate the competitive process, namely barriers
to entry.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB18" href="#fn18">[18]</a></span> 
Predatory conduct is only rational where the firm believes it will be able to
recoup the associated losses (and more) in the
future.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[19]</a></span>  As
barriers to entry are of prime importance to determining the likelihood that the
alleged predator will be able to recoup losses
made during the period of
predation,<span class="sup"><a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[20]</a></span> their
exclusion from the analysis is cause for concern.  Finally, the Birdsville
Amendments render the newly-introduced sub-section
46(4A)
redundant.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[21]</a></span> 
Sub-section 46(4A) provides that when determining whether the a firm has taken
advantage of its market power, the court is permitted
to consider whether the
firm has priced the goods or services in question below cost for a sustained
period of time.  A party seeking
to challenge predatory pricing would be foolish
to attempt to prove that the alleged predator has taken advantage of its market
power
when they could avoid the difficulties associated with establishing
&#8216;market power&#8217; and a &#8216;taking advantage&#8217;
of that power by
bringing their claim under the provisions introduced by the Birdsville
Amendments. </p>
<p>The points made in the previous paragraph provide just a snapshot of the
problems raised by the Birdsville Amendments.  Those interested
in a more
detailed critique of the Birdsville Amendments should read the Australian Law
Council&#8217;s well argued submission to
the
Treasurer.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[22]</a></span>  The
following sections return to the central theme of the paper, namely then need to
amend the &#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>II TAKE ADVANTAGE: ESTABLISHING THE CAUSAL CONNECTION
BETWEEN MARKET POWER AND CONDUCT</b></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>A <i>Take advantage: two possible tests</i></b></p>
<p>The &#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement is included to ensure that only
conduct that is causally connected to market power is
caught by section 46. 
However, the courts have been less than consistent in characterising the type of
causal relationship required
(largely because other issues, such as whether or
not the firm in question had substantial market power, have been more
determinative).
 Two main views have surfaced as to what constitutes a
&#8216;taking advantage&#8217; of market
power.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[23]</a></span>  Under what
will be described in this paper as the Ability Test, a firm will only be held to
be &#8216;taking advantage&#8217; of
its market power if it engages in conduct
that it could not engage in without the market power.  Alternatively, under what
will be
described as the Motivation Test, a &#8216;taking advantage&#8217; of
market power occurs if the business engages in conduct which
it would not be
likely to engage in if it did not have market power.  </p>
<p>Conduct that is caught by the Ability Test will generally be caught by the
Motivation Test.  However, the reverse is not true.  The
Ability Test is
narrower in operation than the Motivation Test because conduct that could
equally be engaged in by a corporation
without market power is not caught by the
Ability Test even though such conduct may lack a commercial rationale in the
absence of
the market power.  </p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>B <i>Take advantage: the case law</i></b></p>
<p>A simple version of the Ability Test was adopted in early court decisions.  
For example, in <i>Williams v
Papersave</i><span class="sup"><a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[24]</a></span> the
Full Federal Court quickly dismissed the allegation that Papersave had taken
advantage of its market power by taking a lease
secured by a competitor on the
basis that such conduct &#8216;could as easily have been committed by a company
having little market
power.&#8217;<span class="sup"><a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">[25]</a></span> 
</p>
<p>When the issue came before the High Court for the first time in <i>Queensland
Wire</i>,<span class="sup"><a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[26]</a></span> the High
Court held that &#8216;taking advantage&#8217; of market power involved
&#8216;use&#8217; of that power and stressed that
the words did not have moral
overtones.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[27]</a></span> 
However, rather than simply asking whether BHP&#8217;s market power gave it the
ability to refuse supply, all judges except for
Deane J employed a
counterfactual test to determine whether BHP had used its power.   This involved
considering how BHP might have
acted if it operated in a more competitive
environment and comparing this to the manner in which BHP actually conducted
itself. 
</p>
<p>All judges concluded that by refusing to supply Queensland Wire, BHP had
&#8216;taken advantage&#8217; of its market power.  However,
the judges reached
this conclusion in slightly different ways.  Mason CJ and Wilson J concluded
that BHP had &#8216;taken advantage&#8217;
of its market power because it was
only by virtue of its control of the market that BHP could, in a commercial
sense, afford to withhold
supply.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[28]</a></span>  Mason CJ
and Wilson J also noted that if BHP operated in a competitive environment, it
was highly unlikely that it would refuse
supply as this would simply result in
its competitors securing additional
sales.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[29]</a></span>  Mason CJ
and Wilson J&#8217;s judgment can be viewed as endorsing both the tests outlined
above.  The first observation made by
Mason CJ and Wilson J appears to be an
application of the Ability Test whereas their second observation uses the
language of the
Motivation Test.  Similarly, Toohey J appears also to have been
influenced by the fact that BHP&#8217;s market power gave it both
the
motivation<span class="sup"><a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">[30]</a></span> and the
ability<span class="sup"><a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[31]</a></span> to refuse
supply.  </p>
<p>The approaches adopted by Dawson J and Deane J are closer to the Ability
Test.  Dawson J applied a counterfactual version of the Ability
Test.  His
Honour found that BHP had taken advantage of its market power because it could
not have acted in the manner in which it
did if it did not possess market
power.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[32]</a></span>  Deane J,
on the other hand, did not think it necessary to think in terms of the
counterfactual.  Rather, in coming to the conclusion
that BHP had &#8216;taken
advantage&#8217; of its market power, Deane J reasoned that as BHP&#8217;s
purpose of preventing QWI from
competing could only be achieved by virtue of
BHP&#8217;s substantial market power, its refusal to supply must have
constituted a
&#8216;taking advantage&#8217; of market
power.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[33]</a></span>  Deane
J&#8217;s approach is similar to the simple version of the Ability Test adopted
by the Full Federal Court in the <i>Papersave</i>.</p>
<p>One thing is clear from the above discussion of the various judgments in
<i>Queensland Wire</i>; neither the Ability Test nor the Motivation Test was
explicitly adopted as the appropriate test for establishing the &#8216;take
advantage&#8217;
requirement.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[34]</a></span> 
However, the decision was largely interpreted by commentators as endorsing the
Motivation Test.  O&#8217;Bryan asserted that the
question asked in
<i>Queensland Wire</i> was &#8216;what would BHP have done in a competitive
market?&#8217;.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[35]</a></span> 
The edition of Duns and Davison&#8217;s competition law case book released after
<i>Queensland Wire</i> stated that that the High Court&#8217;s test for
&#8216;taking advantage&#8217; asks &#8216;whether the conduct in question would
have occurred in a competitive
market?&#8217;.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[36]</a></span> 
Corones&#8217; competition law textbook makes similar
observations.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[37]</a></span> 
Similarly, the judiciary also started to focus on whether the business would be
likely to act in the same manner in a more competitive
environment.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[38]</a></span><i>
</i></p>
<p>The next two section 46 cases to reach the High Court also failed to draw a
clear distinction between the Ability Test and the Motivation
Test.  The joint
judgment in <i>Melway</i> states that a majority of the court in <i>Queensland
Wire</i> considered that the way to test for a &#8216;taking advantage&#8217; of
market power was to ask how the business would have been
likely to behave in a
competitive market (in other words, by applying the Motivation
Test).<span class="sup"><a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[39]</a></span>  However,
in the very next paragraph, the joint judgment says that the majority in
<i>Queensland Wire</i> held that BHP took advantage of market power because it
could not have refused supply in a more competitive
market.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[40]</a></span>  Later,
the joint judgment states that whether Melway could have maintained its
distributorship system without its market power is
the real question that needs
to be resolved.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[41]</a></span> 
Then only paragraphs later, Melway&#8217;s argument that what it would have done
in a more competitive environment was irrelevant
was dismissed on the basis that
it was contrary to the approach adopted by four of the five judges in
<i>Queensland
Wire</i>.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[42]</a></span>  </p>
<p>Once again, the High Court in <i>Melway</i> did not draw a clear distinction
between the Ability Test and the Motivation Test.  This is most likely explained
by the fact that
it did not matter which test applied because, on the
majority&#8217;s view of the facts, even if Melway had been operating in a more
competitive environment it still would have had both the ability and motivation
to maintain its exclusive distributor arrangements.
 </p>
<p>In the second case, <i>Boral</i>, the High Court&#8217;s obiter statements
about the &#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement did not indicate whether the
Ability
Test or the Motivation Test should be used to determine whether or not
conduct involved a &#8216;taking advantage&#8217; of market
power.  This is not
surprising because the contentious issue in <i>Boral</i> was whether Boral had
market power.</p>
<p>It seems fair to suggest that no clear and consistent interpretation emerges
from the abovementioned decisions.  However the <i>Rural Press</i> decision, in
which the court was forced to carefully consider whether to apply the Ability
Test or the Motivation Test, arguably
provides such clarity.  This decision is
discussed in detail in the next section of this paper. </p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>III RURAL PRESS</b></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>A <i>Factual background and outcome</i></b></p>
<p>The <i>Rural Press</i> case arose from attempts by Rural Press to protect the
readership of the <i>Murray Valley Standard</i> (<b>Standard</b>), a newspaper
distributed by one of Rural Press&#8217; subsidiaries in the Murray Bridge
district, which included the township of
Mannum.  The Standard&#8217;s
readership was threatened when, as a result of the restructuring of local
district council boundaries,
Waikerie Printing (<b>Waikerie</b>)<b> </b>decided
to include Mannum in the prime circulation area of its newspaper, the <i>River
News</i>.</p>
<p>Waikerie&#8217;s decision disrupted the status quo.  With one other
exception, only one regional newspaper was published in each geographic
area.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[43]</a></span>  It was
accepted that this resulted from the historical development of the markets,
rather than any express agreement between industry
participants.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>Rural Press<span class="sup"><a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[45]</a></span>
repeatedly expressed its dissatisfaction with Waikerie supplying the Mannum
area, and threatened that unless Waikerie stopped doing
so, Rural Press would
react by distributing a rival newspaper in the Riverland area (possibly at no
charge).  Eventually Wairkerie
acceded to Rural Press&#8217;
threats,<span class="sup"><a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[46]</a></span> and
withdrew from the Mannum area.  </p>
<p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (<b>ACCC</b>) commenced
proceedings and was able to successfully prove that Rural Press and Waikerie had
breached section 45 of the TPA by reaching
an agreement that had an
anti-competitive purpose and
effect<span class="sup"><a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[47]</a></span> and
contained an exclusionary
provision.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[48]</a></span> 
However, the ACCC was unsuccessful in its claim that Rural Press&#8217; threats
also constituted a misuse of market power, in breach
of section 46 of the TPA. 
This paper will focus on the section 46 allegation and, although the author
believes that the findings
on &#8216;market
definition&#8217;<span class="sup"><a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[49]</a></span>
and &#8216;market
power&#8217;<span class="sup"><a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[50]</a></span> are
also open to criticism, the interpretation given to the &#8216;take
advantage&#8217; requirement is the focus of the analysis.</p>

<ol>
<li style="text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;" value='1' value="1"><i>Trial
Judge and Full Federal Court</i><br>
</li></ol><p>From the outset, it is worth noting that the Ability Test was
employed by the trial judge, the Court of Appeal and the High Court
(except for
Kirby J).  At trial, Mansfield J held that Rural Press could not have acted as
it did if it did not have market power
(which Mansfield J held to include Rural
Press&#8217; ability to immediately publish a rival newspaper as well as Rural
Press&#8217;
financial and physical
resources).<span class="sup"><a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[51]</a></span> 
However, the fact that Mansfield J also made comments about the relevance of
what would be possible in a more competitive market
suggests that his Honour did
not accept the Ability Test as the sole way of determining whether a business
had &#8216;taken advantage&#8217;
of its market
power.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[52]</a></span></p>

market<span class="sup"><a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[53]</a></span>, the Full
Federal Court (<b>FFC</b>) also employed the Ability Test.  According to the
FFC, Rural Press relied on its financial strength (which the FFC held was not
a
form of market power) to make its threats
credible.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[54]</a></span>  As
Rural Press <i>could</i> have acted in precisely same way in a more competitive
market the FFC concluded that the &#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement
had
not been
satisfied.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[55]</a></span>  The
FFC also noted that the fact that Rural Press may have lacked the motivation to
make the threat in the absence of its market
power was not enough to establish
that it had &#8216;taken advantage&#8217; of that
power.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[56]</a></span>  This
appears to be a pretty clear endorsement of the Ability Test over the Motivation
Test.</p>
<p>2.	<i>High Court - majority</i></p>
<p>A majority of the High Court upheld the decision of the FFC.  In reaching
this conclusion, the majority noted that &#8216;the words
&#8220;take
advantage&#8221; do not extend to any kind of connection at all between market
power and the (prohibited
purposes)&#8217;<span class="sup"><a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[57]</a></span>
and that &#8216;the conduct of &#8216;taking advantage&#8217; of a thing is not
identical with the conduct of protecting that
thing&#8217;.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[58]</a></span>  The
majority stated that to reason as the ACCC did, namely that Rural Press
&#8216;took advantage&#8217; of its market power because
its conduct had no
commercial rationale in the absence of such power, was to confound the
&#8216;take advantage&#8217; and &#8216;purpose&#8217;
requirements.  Rather,
the High Court concluded that as Rural Press had chosen to protect its market
power by a method not dependent
on the existence of that power, it had not
breached section 46.  Put simply, a majority of the High Court endorsed the
FFC&#8217;s
use of the Ability Test.  </p>
<p>3.	<i>Kirby J (dissenting) </i></p>
<p>Kirby J dissented and was highly critical of the approach adopted by the
majority.  He criticised the majority for resolving the issue
on such a
&#8216;narrow, formalistic and substantially verbal
ground&#8217;.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[59]</a></span> 
His Honour also asserted that the conclusion reached by the majority was
commercially
unrealistic<span class="sup"><a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[60]</a></span> and
&#8216;cripple[d] the effectiveness of s
46.&#8217;<span class="sup"><a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[61]</a></span> </p>
<p>Kirby J described the suggestion that Rural Press&#8217; market power was
causally irrelevant to Waikeree&#8217;s decision to withdraw
from Mannum as
&#8216;fanciful&#8217;.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[62]</a></span>
Whilst Kirby J did not dispute that the &#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement
requires there to be a causal connection between
the market power and the
conduct in question, he rejected the idea that the Ability Test was the sole
means of establishing such
a connection.  Rather, Kirby J held that such a
connection could also be proven by establishing that in the absence of the
market
power Rural Press had no commercial reason to engage in the conduct (in
other words, by applying the Motivation
Test)<span class="sup"><a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[63]</a></span> or by
showing a temporal concurrence of power and outcome (in other words, by adopting
the approach adopted by Deane J in <i>Queensland
Wire</i>).<span class="sup"><a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[64]</a></span></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>C <i>Take advantage: clear and consistent
meaning?</i></b></p>
<p>The <i>Rural Press </i>majority&#8217;s endorsement of the Ability Test and
rejection of the Motivation Test gives the phrase &#8216;take advantage&#8217;
a
more certain meaning.  However, some uncertainty about the operation of the
&#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement remains. 
Firstly, the exclusive use of
the Ability Test is inconsistent with the earlier case law.  Second, the
<i>Rural Press</i> majority did not overrule or call into question the
approaches adopted in earlier cases, thus limiting the extent to which the
decision
brings clarity.  Third, some maintain that even after the <i>Rural
Press </i>decision, a taking advantage of market power can be proven by
establishing that either the market power gives rise to particular conduct
(Ability Test) or that the conduct would not be reasonably engaged in by a
business lacking market power (Motivation
Test).<span class="sup"><a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[65]</a></span>  Finally in
<i>NT Power</i>, a decision delivered two years after <i>Rural Press</i>, a
majority of the High Court asked a composite question to determine whether the
Power Authority had taken advantage of its market
power, and required the
applicant to prove that the requirements of the Ability Test and the Motivation
Test had been
satisfied.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[66]</a></span>  Whilst
this approach appears to be appropriate, it was not foreshadowed in the <i>Rural
Press</i> decision.</p>
<p>Because of the residual uncertainty discussed in the preceding paragraph, and
because of Kirby J&#8217;s strongly expressed view that
the issue of whether or
not a firm had &#8216;taken advantage&#8217; of its market power could be
resolved by applying the Motivation
Test, the following section considers
section 46&#8217;s legislative history with a view to determining whether the
approach adopted
by the majority in <i>Rural Press</i> is legally correct and
sufficiently certain.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>IV WHAT IS THE TRUE MEANING OF THE TAKE ADVANTAGE
REQUIREMENT: LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</b></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>A <i>The legislative history of section 46</i></b></p>
<p>Given the lack of clarity about the meaning of the phrase &#8216;take
advantage&#8217;, it is surprising that no section 46 case to
date has
considered the provision&#8217;s legislative history.  This is unfortunate, as
section 46&#8217;s legislative history provides
significant insights into the
intended operation of the &#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement.</p>
<p>In September 1973, the Government introduced the Trade Practices Bill 1973
(Cth) (<b>1973 Bill</b>).  Clause 46 of the 1973 Bill contained a prohibition
against &#8216;monopolization&#8217; that went further than the prohibition
ultimately enacted in 1974.  </p>
<p>The 1973 Bill proposed to regulate businesses &#8216;in a position
substantially to control a market&#8217; in two ways.  First, such
firms were
prohibited from engaging in conduct directed to achieving specified
anti-competitive
outcomes<span class="sup"><a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[67]</a></span> <i>in the
market in which the business was dominant</i>.  This prohibition could be
breached even if the conduct in question was not directly connected to or made
possible by the business&#8217;s
dominant position.  Secondly, businesses in a
dominant position were also prohibited from <i>taking advantage</i> of their
dominant position to achieve specified anti-competitive outcomes <i>in another
market</i>.  Thus, under the 1973 Bill, it was only necessary that
anti-competitive conduct was made possible by the market power if it was
alleged
that market power was being leveraged into another market.</p>
<p>The Coalition Opposition resisted the introduction of such a clause.  The
Parliamentary Debates illustrate the Coalition Opposition&#8217;s
residual
uneasiness with the concept of regulating unilateral conduct and general desire
not to unduly hamper big
business.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[68]</a></span>  This
uneasiness is evident in the Coalition&#8217;s unsuccessful attempts to require
the offence to be made out beyond a reasonable
doubt before pecuniary penalties
could be imposed<span class="sup"><a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[69]</a></span>
and its attempts to ensure that section 46 would only be breached where the
business in question wilfully took advantage of its market
power.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p>While the amendments sought by the Coalition were rejected by the Government
on the basis that they imposed unnecessary limitations
on the &#8216;behaviour
that is sought to be made
accountable&#8217;,<span class="sup"><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[71]</a></span>
the Coalition did manage to cause the scope of the &#8216;monopolization&#8217;
provision to be narrowed in another way. </p>
<p>In July 1974, when the Trade Practices Bill was re-introduced into Parliament
(<b>1974 Bill</b>), it included a re-drafted version of clause 46.  Clause 46
was amended so that, irrespective of the market affected by the conduct,
the
provision would not be breached unless the conduct in question constituted a
&#8216;taking advantage&#8217; of market power (or,
to put it another way, was
made possible by the firm&#8217;s market power). </p>
<p>The following extract from the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the
introduction of the <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/tprb1986262/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Revision Bill 1986</a> lends further support to
the argument that the High Court&#8217;s narrow interpretation of the phrase is
mandated by the legislative
wording:</p>
<p>&#8216;The corporation having the requisite degree of market power is not
prohibited from engaging in any <u>conduct</u> directed to one or other of the
objectives set out in paras 46(1)(a), (b) and (c).  Such a prohibition would
unduly inhibit competitive
activity in the market place... </p>
<p>The term <u>take<i> </i>advantage</u> in this context indicates that the
corporation is able, by reason of its market power, to engage more readily and
effectively in
conduct directed to one or other of the objectives in paragraphs
(a), (b) and (c). It is better able, by reason of its market power,
to engage in
that conduct.  Its market power gives it leverage which it is able exploit and
this power is deployed so as to &#8216;take
advantage of&#8217; the relative
weaknesses of other participants or potential participants in the
market.&#8217;<span class="sup"><a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[72]</a></span></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>B <i>Rural Press reconsidered</i></b></p>
<p>The above discussion suggests that the legislature made a conscious decision
to include the take advantage requirement to limit the
scope of section 46 in
precisely the manner recognised by the High Court
majority.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[73]</a></span> 
However, as some believe that the majority&#8217;s interpretation of the
&#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement involves a &#8216;failure
to do justice
to the parliamentary intention behind section
46&#8217;<span class="sup"><a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[74]</a></span> and
because Kirby J believed that his interpretation of the &#8216;take
advantage&#8217; requirement results from a permitted form
of purposive
statutory
interpretation,<span class="sup"><a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[75]</a></span> it
is necessary to give further consideration to the approach adopted by Kirby
J.</p>
<p>Kirby J&#8217;s interpretation of the taking advantage requirement is open to
two main criticisms. First, that the words &#8216;take
advantage&#8217; have a
clear meaning, negating the need for reference to policy
considerations.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[76]</a></span> 
Secondly, even if there is a need for such methods of legislative
interpretation, his Honour incorrectly identified the policies
underpinning
section 46.</p>
<p>The first criticism can be disposed of quickly.  It is based on observations,
such as those made by Gleeson CJ and Callinan J in <i>Rural Press</i>, albeit in
the context of the section 4D claim, that presumed policy intentions
&#8216;cannot be permitted to divert attention from
the
text&#8217;.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[77]</a></span> 
Whilst it is arguable that as the provision expressly provides that &#8216;the
corporation shall not take advantage of <i>that</i> power&#8217; there is no
ambiguity about the type of causal connection
required,<span class="sup"><a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[78]</a></span> the
legislative direction to have regard to the purpose or object underlying the
Act<span class="sup"><a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[79]</a></span> coupled with
the increased judicial tolerance of departing from the literal meaning of the
words where they do not appear to conform
with the intention of the
legislature,<span class="sup"><a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[80]</a></span>
suggests that Kirby J was right to consider the underlying policy. </p>
<p>The second criticism however is more valid.  Whilst purposive construction
appears appropriate in the circumstances, Kirby J defines
the policy
underpinnings of section 46 by reference to the very general statement of
purpose contained in section 2 of the
TPA<span class="sup"><a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[81]</a></span> and previous
judicial comments that the object of section 46 was to protect and advance
competition.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">[82]</a></span>
However, as the above discussion of the parliamentary
debates<span class="sup"><a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[83]</a></span> and
Explanatory
Memorandum<span class="sup"><a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[84]</a></span>
demonstrates, the legislature consciously excluded certain types of
anti-competitive conduct from the scope of section 46.  Motherhood
statements,
such as those contained in section 2 of the TPA, should not be permitted to
override this conscious legislative decision.
 By doing so, Kirby J has arguably
given section 46 an operation which does not accord with the intention of the
legislature, despite
his statements to the
contrary.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[85]</a></span></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>C <i>Sub-section 46(5)</i></b></p>
<p>While the legislative history of the provision suggests that the Ability Test
is appropriate, the inclusion of section 46(5), which
provides that a
corporation does not breach section 46 by reason only that it acquires plant or
equipment, lends support to an argument
that the Motivation Test is appropriate.
This is because whilst the commercial rationale of such conduct may only be
explained by
reference to a desire to protect or create market power, the
acquisition of plant and equipment is something that any business with
sufficient financial resources could<i>
</i>do.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[86]</a></span>  It is
therefore arguable that the Motivation Test is appropriate because the Ability
Test would render section 46(5) redundant.
 However, as the bulk of section
46&#8217;s legislative history indicates that the Ability Test was intended by
the legislature,
section 46(5) is probably better viewed as being included to
avoid any doubt that the potential anti-competitive effects of mergers
or
acquisitions are exclusively regulated by section 50, rather than impliedly
suggesting that such conduct might fall within the
section.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[87]</a></span>  </p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p>The examination of section 46&#8217;s legislative history strongly suggests
that, as recognised by the majority in <i>Rural Press</i>, the Ability Test must
be satisfied before a firm will be held to have &#8216;taken advantage&#8217; of
its market power.  Although
recent case law and section 46&#8217;s legislative
history resolve, to a large extent, the ambiguity about what constitutes a
&#8216;taking
advantage&#8217; of market power, they also demonstrate that the
&#8216;take advantage requirement, correctly interpreted, creates
a gap in
section 46&#8217;s ability to appropriately regulate unilateral anti-competitive
conduct.  Unilateral anti-competitive conduct
engaged in by a corporation with
market power is beyond the reach of section 46 unless that conduct was made
possible, or at least
materially facilitated, by that market power (in other
words, unless the Ability Test is satisfied).  As a result, conduct that could
equally be engaged in by a corporation without market power is not caught by
section 46, even though such conduct may lack a commercial
rationale in the
absence of the market power.  This is of concern because it allows businesses
with market power to protect or strengthen
that market power in ways that would
be ineffective in the absence of market power so long as they engage in forms of
anti-competitive
conduct that could be engaged in by someone without market
power. </p>
<p>Given this gap in the coverage of section 46, it seems quite odd that the
Government dismissed the Senate Committee&#8217;s recommendation
to amend the
&#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement in section 46.  The Government does not
appear to fully appreciate the extent
to which the interpretation of the
&#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement recognised in <i>Rural Press </i>limits
the coverage of section
46.<span class="sup"><a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[88]</a></span>  For example,
the Government&#8217;s Response to the Senate Committee&#8217;s report does not
consider, let alone justify, why it
was appropriate that Rural Press escape
liability under section 46 even though all members of the High Court were
clearly of the
opinion that its conduct was inherently anti-competitive and
motivated by its market power.  Furthermore, the narrow interpretation
given to
the &#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement by the majority in <i>Rural
</i>Press is legally correct.  Kirby J&#8217;s approach, whilst preferable, is
simply not open on the current wording of section 46. 
Legislative change is
necessary in order to ensure the take advantage requirement does not restrict
section 46&#8217;s ability to
effectively regulate unilateral anti-competitive
conduct.  </p>
<p>To ensure section 46 effectively regulates unilateral anti-competitive
conduct engaged in by a firm with market power, the Government
should reconsider
its decision to reject the Senate Committee&#8217;s recommendation to amend the
&#8216;take advantage&#8217; requirement.
 Whilst the declaratory provision
recommended by the Senate Committee is unlikely to resolve this issue, section
46 should be amended
to ensure that a firm &#8216;takes advantage&#8217; of its
market power if its market power gives it either the motivation or the
ability
to engage in the impugned conduct.  In other words, section 46 should be amended
so that it a &#8216;taking advantage&#8217;
of market power can be established
by proving that either the Motivation Test or the Ability Test has been
satisfied.  Such an amendment
overcomes the gap in coverage in a manner that is
simple, clear, intuitive and likely to be easily understood (especially as it
employs
the test that many believed was mandated by the legislation prior to the
<i>Rural Press</i> decision).  Furthermore, the allowing parties to prove a
&#8216;taking advantage&#8217; by establishing that the Motivation Test
has been
satisfied is unlikely to result in competitive conduct being caught by section
46 because the focus remains squarely on
whether the business would behave in
the same way in a more competitive environment.</p>

members of the Full Federal Court and the High Court accepted Mansfield
J&#8217;s finding that the relevant market was the Murray
Bridge newspaper
market.  However, this finding appears unsound and inconsistent with generally
recognised principles of market definition.
 Whilst Mansfield J gave sufficient
consideration to demand side substitutability (by considering Rural Press&#8217;
argument that
demand side substitution possibilities meant that the product
dimension of the market should have included other forms of media),
supply side
substitutability appears to have been overlooked when determining the geographic
dimension of the market.  Waikerie&#8217;s
attempted expansion into the township
of Mannum suggests that, absent behavioural barriers to entry of a kind Rural
Press was attempting
to erect by threatening Waikerie (and making threats in
response to increase competition in the Barossa Valley region), considerable
supply side substitution possibilities existed.  This in turn suggests that the
geographic dimension of the market was too narrowly
defined.
<br><span class="sup"><a name="fn50" href="#fnB50">[50]</a></span> Rural
Press&#8217; market share and the existing distribution patterns and market
boundaries played too great a role in Mansfield
J&#8217;s reasoning as to the
existence of market power, as did Rural Press&#8217; significant financial
resources.   Despite noting
that barriers to entry should be the primary
consideration when determining whether a firm has market power, the existence of
barriers
to entry did not feature heavily in Mansfield J&#8217;s analysis.  His
Honour identified two barriers to entry, namely high sunk
costs and behavioural
barriers resulting from similar conduct in the Barossa Valley area.  However, as
sunk costs would not prevent
existing publishers (of which there are many)
providing newspapers in other areas, they do not create significant barriers to
entry.
 After all, as Mansfield J acknowledged later in the judgment, publishing
a newspaper in a new area is, for an existing publisher,
only a matter of
marginal cost (see <i>Rural Press (trial)</i>, above n 44, para 131).  Mansfield
J&#8217;s willingness to recognise behavioural barriers to entry is encouraging.
However, none
of the subsequent judges included Rural Press&#8217; behaviour in
the Barossa Valley in their description of the impugned conduct.

also relied on the fact that the threats occurred in a market in which Rural
Press had no market power (ie the Riverland
newspaper market) (see <i>Rural
Press (FFC)</i>, above n 43, 276-7).  Kirby J rejected this argument.  His
Honour held that the FFC had described the conduct in question too narrowly
and
that the conduct was more appropriately viewed as a conditional threat that
would be carried out unless Waikerie withdrew from
the Mannum area.  Kirby J
believed this established the relevant connection to the Murray Bridge newspaper
market (which included
the township of Mannum) and overcame the FFC&#8217;s
conclusion that the conduct had no connection to Rural Press&#8217; market power
as it only occurred in the Riverland market (see <i>Rural Press (HC)</i>, above
n 8, 101).  However, as the High Court majority did not rely on such an argument
in reaching its conclusion, it will not receive
further consideration.

the ACCC&#8217;s argument that prior cases suggested that the

test very quickly by pointing to

Swanson Committee stated that the provision was included because &#8216;concern
was expressed ... that a monopolist who invested
in new capital and equipment
might be regarded as contravening the section&#8217;.  The Committee considered
that it was desirable
to ensure that the section is not used &#8216;as an excuse
for failure to invest&#8217; (see <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/" class="autolink_findacts">Trade Practices Act</a> Review Committee,
<i>Report to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs</i> (1976) p
6.11).<br><span class="sup"><a name="fn88" href="#fnB88">[88]</a></span>
Comments made in the Government Response (above n 4) support this contention. 
For example, the Government Response to the Senate
Committee Report states that
<i>Rural Press </i>is consistent with previous case law and that there is
&#8216;nothing about the High Court&#8217;s application of &#8216;take
advantage&#8217;
in <i>Rural Press </i>that suggests a narrowing of <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section
46</a>&#8217;(at p 6)  The language used by the Senate Committee when framing its
recommendation may also have contributed to the Government&#8217;s
belief that
<i>Rural Press</i> did not narrow the application of <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 46.</a>  Rather than
acknowledging that a change in the law was being recommended, the Senate
Committee Report (above n 2) included the recommendation
in a declaratory
provision.  The Senate Committee Report also states that the effect of the
amendment would be to &#8216;remove current
uncertainty with regard to the
meaning of &#8216;take advantage&#8217;&#8217; (at p 15).  Describing the
amendment in this way suggests
that the purpose of the amendment is simply to
clarify existing law.  This may have contributed to the Government&#8217;s
belief
that <i>Rural Press</i> did not narrow the application of <a href="/web/20160317144309/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tpa1974149/s46.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 46.</a></p>

Summary of query: parents concerns about religious classes at school
The Conservative movement defines a Jew as a person born to a Jewish mother or converted to Judaism.
Many families send their child to The Jewish Center Nursery School precisely because it is "Jewish," that is, Jewish life and particularly Shabbat are revered.
When parents of children attending (or who recently attended) Jewish day schools were asked to describe their feelings about being Jewish, over 90 per cent of respondents were strongly or extremely conscious of feeling Jewish (see Table 3.2).
The non-Jewish parent is made to feel pretty welcome.
